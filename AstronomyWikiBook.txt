Angular momentum

In physics, angular momentum (rarely, moment of momentum or rotational
momentum) is the rotational analog of linear momentum. It is an important
quantity in physics because it is a conserved quantity – the angular
momentum of a system remains constant unless acted on by an external
torque.

Angular momentum is related to the rotation or revolution of matter. It is,
in effect, a measure of the quantity of rotation of a system of matter,
taking into account its mass, rotations, motions and shape. The
conservation of angular momentum explains many observed phenomena. For
example, the increase in rotational speed of a spinning figure skater as
the skater's arms are contracted, the high rotational rates of neutron
stars, the falling cat problem and precession can all be explained in terms
of angular momentum conservation. It has numerous applications in physics,
engineering and everyday life, for instance, the gyrocompass, control
moment gyroscope, inertial guidance systems, reaction wheels, tops, flying
discs or Frisbees and Earth's rotation.

Angular momentum in classical mechanics

Definition

Main articles: Scalar (physics) and Euclidean vector

Scalar - angular momentum in two dimensions

Angular momentum is a vector quantity (more precisely, a pseudovector) that
represents the product of a body's rotational inertia and rotational
velocity about a particular axis. In the simple case of revolution of a
particle in a circle about a center of rotation, the particle remaining
always in the same plane and having always the same distance from the
center, it is sufficient to discard the vector nature of angular momentum,
and treat it as a scalar.¹ Angular momentum can be considered a rotational
analog of linear momentum. Thus, where linear momentum is proportional to
mass m and linear speed v,

p = mv,

angular momentum is proportional to moment of inertia I and angular speed
ω,²

L = Iω.

Unlike mass, which depends only on amount of matter, moment of inertia is
also dependent on the position of the axis of rotation and the shape of the
matter. Unlike linear speed, which occurs in a straight line, angular speed
occurs about a center of rotation.

Because I=r²m for a single particle and ω=v/r for circular motion, angular
momentum can be expanded, L=(r^2m)\left ( \frac{v}{r} \right ) , and
reduced to,

L=rmv,

the product of the radius of rotation r and the linear momentum of the
particle p=mv, where v in this case is the equivalent linear (tangential)
speed at the radius (=rω).

This simple analysis can also apply to non-circular motion if only the
component of the motion which is perpendicular to the radius vector is
considered. In that case,

L = rmv_\perp ,

where v_\perp = v\sin θ is the perpendicular component of the motion.
Expanding, L=rmv\sin{θ} , rearranging, L=r\sin{θ} mv, and reducing, angular
momentum can also be expressed,

L=r_\perp mv,

where r_\perp = r\sin{θ} is the length of the moment arm, a line dropped
perpendicularly from the origin onto the path of the particle. It is this
definition, (length of moment arm)×(linear momentum) to which the term
moment of momentum refers.³

Vector - angular momentum in three dimensions

To completely define angular momentum in three dimensions, it is required
to know the angle swept out in unit time, the direction of the axis of
rotation, and the sense (right- or left-handed) of the rotation, as well as
the mass involved.⁴ By retaining this vector nature of angular momentum,
the general nature of the equations is also retained, and can describe any
sort of three-dimensional motion about the center of rotation – circular,
linear, or otherwise. In vector notation, the angular momentum of a
particle in motion about the origin of coordinates is defined as:

L = I\boldsymbol{ω} ,
    I=r²m is the moment of inertia for a point mass,
    \boldsymbol{ω} =\frac{r\times v}{r²} is the angular velocity of the
    particle about the origin,
    r is the position vector of the particle relative to the origin,
    r=\left \vert r\right \vert ,
    v is the linear velocity of the particle relative to the origin,
    and m is the mass of the particle.

This can be expanded, L=(r^2m)\left (\frac{r\times v}{r²} \right ),
reduced, L = m(r\times v),and by the rules of vector algebra rearranged to
the form,

L =r\times mv &= r\times p,

which is the cross product of the position vector r and the linear momentum
p=mv of the particle. By the definition of the cross product, the L vector
is perpendicular to both r and p. It is directed along the axis of rotation
as indicated by the right-hand rule – so that the rotation is seen as
counter-clockwise from the head of the vector. Conversely, the L vector
defines the plane in which r and p lie.

By defining a unit vector \hat{u} in the direction of the axis of rotation,
a scalar angular speed ω results, where

  ω\hat{u} =\boldsymbol{ω} , andω=\frac{v_{\perp }}{r} , where v_{\perp }
  is the perpendicular component of the motion, as above.

The two-dimensional scalar equations of the previous section can thus be
given direction:

L =I\boldsymbol{ω} &=Iω\hat{u} &=(r^2m)ω\hat{u} &=rmv_{\perp }\hat{u}
&=r_{\perp }mv\hat{u} ,

and L=rmv\hat{u} for circular motion, where all of the motion is
perpendicular to the radius r.

Discussion

Angular momentum can be described as the rotational analog of linear
momentum. Like linear momentum it involves elements of mass and
displacement. Unlike linear momentum it also involves elements of position
and shape.

Many problems in physics involve matter in motion about some certain point
in space, be it in actual rotation about it, or simply moving past it,
where it is desired to know what effect the moving matter has on the point
- can it exert energy upon it or perform work about it? Energy, the ability
to do work, can be stored in matter by setting it in motion - a combination
of its inertia and its displacement. Inertia is measured by its mass, and
displacement by its velocity. Their product,

(amount of inertia) \times (amount of displacement) =amount of
(inertia·displacement) mass \times velocity &= momentum m \times v &= p

is the matter's momentum.⁵ Referring this momentum to a central point
introduces a complication: the momentum is not applied to the point
directly. For instance, a particle of matter at the outer edge of a wheel
is, in effect, at the end of a lever of the same length as the wheel's
radius, its momentum turning the lever about the center point. This
imaginary lever is known as the moment arm. It has the effect of
multiplying the momentum's effort in proportion to its length, an effect
known as a moment. Hence, the particle's momentum referred to a particular
point,

(moment arm) \times (amount of inertia) \times (amount of displacement)
=moment of (inertia·displacement) length \times mass \times velocity &=
moment of momentum r \times m \times v &= L

is the angular momentum, sometimes called, as here, the moment of momentum
of the particle versus that particular center point. The equation L=rmv
combines a moment (a mass m turning moment arm r) with a linear
(straight-line equivalent) speed v. Linear speed referred to the central
point is simply the product of the distance r and the angular speed ω
versus the point: v=rω, another moment. Hence, angular momentum contains a
double moment: L=rmrω. Simplifying slightly, L=r^2mω, the quantity r²m is
the particle's moment of inertia, sometimes called the second moment of
mass. It is a measure of rotational inertia.⁶

Because rotational inertia is a part of angular momentum, it necessarily
includes all of the complications of moment of inertia, which is calculated
by multiplying elementary bits of the mass by the squares of their
distances from the center of rotation.⁷ Therefore the total moment of
inertia, and the angular momentum, is a complex function of the
configuration of the matter about the center of rotation and the
orientation of the rotation for the various bits.

For a rigid body, for instance a wheel or an asteroid, the orientation of
rotation is simply the position of the rotation axis versus the matter of
the body. It may or may not pass through the center of mass, or it may lie
completely outside of the body. For the same body, angular momentum may
take a different value for every possible axis about which rotation may
take place.⁸ It reaches a minimum when the axis passes through the center
of mass.⁹

For a collection of objects revolving about a center, for instance all of
the bodies of the Solar System, the orientations may be somewhat organized,
as is the Solar System, with most of the bodies' axes lying close to the
system's axis. Their orientations may also be completely random.

In brief, the more mass and the farther it is from the center of rotation
(the longer the moment arm), the greater the moment of inertia, and
therefore the greater the angular momentum for a given angular velocity. In
many cases the moment of inertia, and hence the angular momentum, can be
simplified by,¹⁰

  I=k²m,where k is the radius of gyration, the distance from the axis at
  which the entire mass m may be considered as concentrated.

Similarly, for a point mass m the moment of inertia is defined as,

  I=r²mwhere r is the radius of the point mass from the center of rotation,

and for any collection of particles m_i as the sum,

Σ_i I_i = Σ_i r_i²m_i

Angular momentum's dependence on position and shape is reflected in its
units versus linear momentum: kg·m²/s, N·m·s or J·s for angular momentum
versus kg·m/s or N·s for linear momentum. Angular momentum's units can be
interpreted as torque·seconds, work·seconds, or energy·seconds. An object
with angular momentum of L N·m·s can be reduced to zero rotation (all of
the energy can be transferred out of it) by an angular impulse of L N·m·s¹¹
or equivalently, by torque or work of L N·m for one second, or energy of L
J for one second.¹²

The plane perpendicular to the axis of angular momentum and passing through
the center of mass¹³ is sometimes called the invariable plane, because the
direction of the axis remains fixed if only the interactions of the bodies
within the system, free from outside influences, are considered.¹⁴ One such
plane is the invariable plane of the Solar System.

Angular momentum and torque

See also: Torque § Definition and relation to angular momentum

Newton's Second Law of Motion can be expressed mathematically,

F = ma,

or Force = mass × acceleration. The rotational equivalent is

\boldsymbol{τ} = I\boldsymbol{α} ,

or torque = moment of inertia × angular acceleration. Because angular
acceleration is the time derivative of angular velocity, this is equivalent
to \boldsymbol{τ} = I\frac{d\boldsymbol{ω} }{dt} . Rearranging into a form
suitable for integration, \boldsymbol{τ} = \frac{d(I\boldsymbol{ω} )}{dt}
and \boldsymbol{τ} dt = d(I\boldsymbol{ω} ), and integrating with respect
to time,

∫\boldsymbol{τ} dt = I\boldsymbol{ω} + constant.

Therefore, a torque acting over time is equivalent to a change in angular
momentum. The constant can be interpreted as the initial angular momentum
of the body, before the torque began to act. In particular, if torque
\boldsymbol{τ} = 0, then angular momentum L = 0 + constant.¹⁵ That is, if
no torque acts upon a body, then its angular momentum remains constant.
Conversely,

L = I\boldsymbol{ω}

or Angular momentum = moment of inertia × angular velocity, and its time
derivative is

\frac{dL}{dt} = \frac{dI}{dt} \boldsymbol{ω} + I\frac{d\boldsymbol{ω} }{dt}
.

Because moment of inertia is constant, \frac{dI}{dt} is zero, and
\frac{dL}{dt} = 0 + I\frac{d\boldsymbol{ω} }{dt} , which, as above, reduces
to

\frac{dL}{dt} = I\boldsymbol{α} .

Therefore, the time rate of change of angular momentum is equivalent to
torque. If angular momentum is constant, \frac{dL}{dt} = 0 and no torque is
applied.

Conservation of angular momentum

Conservation follows mathematically from isotropy, or continuous
directional symmetry of space, that is, no direction in space is any
different from any other direction. See Noether's theorem.¹⁶

A rotational analog of Newton's Third Law of Motion might be written, "In a
closed system, no torque can be exerted on any matter without the exertion
on some other matter of an equal and opposite torque."¹⁷ Hence, angular
momentum can be exchanged between objects in a closed system, but total
angular momentum before and after an exchange remains constant (is
conserved).¹⁸

Similarly, a rotational analogy of Newton's Second law of Motion might be,
"A change in angular momentum is proportional to the applied torque and
occurs about the same axis as that torque."¹⁷ Since a torque applied over
time is equivalent to a change in angular momentum, then if torque is zero,
angular momentum is constant. As above, a system with constant angular
momentum is a closed system. Therefore, requiring the system to be closed
is equivalent to requiring that no external influence, in the form of a
torque, acts upon it.¹⁹

A rotational analog of Newton's First Law of Motion might be written, "A
body continues in a state of rest or of uniform rotation unless compelled
by a torque to change its state."¹⁷ Thus with no external influence to act
upon it, the original angular momentum of the system is conserved.²⁰

The conservation of angular momentum is used in analyzing central force
motion. If the net force on some body is directed always toward some point,
the center, then there is no torque on the body with respect to the center,
as all of the force is directed along the radius vector, and none is
perpendicular to the radius. Mathematically, torque \boldsymbol{τ} = r
\times F = 0, because in this case r and F are parallel vectors. Therefore,
the angular momentum of the body about the center is constant. This is the
case with gravitational attraction in the orbits of planets and satellites,
where the gravitational force is always directed toward the primary body
and orbiting bodies conserve angular momentum by exchanging distance and
velocity as they move about the primary. Central force motion is also used
in the analysis of the Bohr model of the atom.

For a planet, angular momentum is distributed between the spin of the
planet and its revolution in its orbit, and these are often exchanged by
various mechanisms. The conservation of angular momentum in the Earth–Moon
system results in the transfer of angular momentum from Earth to Moon, due
to tidal torque the Moon exerts on the Earth. This in turn results in the
slowing down of the rotation rate of Earth, at about 65.7 nanoseconds per
day,²¹ and in gradual increase of the radius of Moon's orbit, at about 3.82
centimeters per year.²²

The conservation of angular momentum explains the angular acceleration of
an ice skater as she brings her arms and legs close to the vertical axis of
rotation. By bringing part of the mass of her body closer to the axis she
decreases her body's moment of inertia. Because angular momentum is the
product of moment of inertia and angular velocity, if the angular momentum
remains constant (is conserved), then the angular velocity (rotational
speed) of the skater must increase.

The same phenomenon results in extremely fast spin of compact stars (like
white dwarfs, neutron stars and black holes) when they are formed out of
much larger and slower rotating stars. Decrease in the size of an object n
times results in increase of its angular velocity by the factor of n².

Angular momentum in orbital mechanics

Main article: Specific relative angular momentum

In astrodynamics and celestial mechanics, a massless (or per unit mass)
angular momentum is defined

h = r \times v,

called specific angular momentum. Note that L = mh. Mass is often
unimportant in orbital mechanics calculations, because motion is defined by
gravity. The primary body of the system is often so much larger than any
bodies in motion about it that the smaller bodies have a negligible
gravitational effect on it; it is, in effect, stationary. All bodies are
apparently attracted by its gravity in the same way, regardless of mass,
and therefore all move approximately the same way under the same
conditions.

Solid bodies

For a continuous mass distribution with density function ρ(r), a
differential volume element dV with position vector r within the mass has a
mass element dm = ρ(r)dV. Therefore the infinitesimal angular momentum of
this element is:

dL = r\times dm v = r\times ρ(r) dV v = dV r\times ρ(r) v

and integrating this differential over the volume of the entire mass gives
its total angular momentum:

L=∫_V dV r\times ρ(r) v

Collection of particles

Center of mass

It is convenient to develop the equation of angular momentum for a
collection of particles in motion about an arbitrary origin by resolving
their motion into components about their own center of mass and about the
origin. Given,

  m_i is the mass of particle i, R_i is the position vector of particle i
  vs the origin, V_i is the velocity of particle i vs the origin, R is the
  position vector of the center of mass vs the origin, V is the velocity of
  the center of mass vs the origin, r_i is the position vector of particle
  i vs the center of mass, v_i is the velocity of particle i vs the center
  of mass,

The total mass of the particles is simply their sum,

M=Σ_i m_i.

The position vector of the center of mass is defined by,²³

MR=Σ_i m_i R_i.

By inspection,

  R_i = R + r_i and V_i = V + v_i.

The total angular momentum of the collection of particles is the sum of the
angular momentum of each particle,

Expanding R_i,

L = Σ_i \left [ (R+r_i) \times m_iV_i\right ] &= Σ_i \left [ R \times
m_iV_i + r_i \times m_iV_i \right ]

Expanding V_i,

L = Σ_i \left [ R \times m_i(V + v_i) + r_i \times m_i(V + v_i) \right ] &=
Σ_i \left [ R \times m_iV + R \times m_iv_i + r_i \times m_iV + r_i \times
m_iv_i \right ] &= Σ_i R \times m_iV + Σ_i R \times m_iv_i + Σ_i r_i \times
m_iV + Σ_i r_i \times m_iv_i

It can be shown that (see sidebar),

  Σ_i m_ir_i = 0 and Σ_i m_iv_i = 0,

therefore the second and third terms vanish,

L = Σ_i R \times m_iV + Σ_i r_i \times m_iv_i .

The first term can be rearranged,

Σ_i R \times m_iV = R \times Σ_i m_iV = R \times MV,

and total angular momentum for the collection of particles is finally,²⁴

The first term is the angular momentum of the center of mass relative to
the origin. Similar to Single particle, below, it is the angular momentum
of one particle of mass M at the center of mass moving with velocity V. The
second term is the angular momentum of the particles moving relative to the
center of mass, similar to Fixed center of mass, below. The result is
general - the motion of the particles is not restricted to rotation or
revolution about the origin or center of mass. The particles need not be
individual masses, but can be elements of a continuous distribution, such
as a solid body.

Rearranging equation (2) by vector identities, multiplying both terms by
"one", and grouping appropriately,

L = M(R \times V) + Σ_i [m_i(r_i \times v_i)], &= \frac{R²}{R²} M(R \times
V) + Σ_i \left [ \frac{r_i²}{r_i²} m_i(r_i \times v_i)\right ] , &= R^2M
\left ( \frac{R \times V}{R²} \right ) + Σ_i \left [ r_i^2m_i \left (
\frac{r_i \times v_i}{r_i²} \right ) \right ] ,

gives the total angular momentum of the system of particles in terms of
moment of inertia I and angular velocity \boldsymbol{ω} ,

Simplifications

Single particle

In the case of a single particle moving about the arbitrary origin,

  r_i = v_i = 0,r = R,v = V,m = M,Σ_i r_i \times m_iv_i = 0,Σ_i
  I_i\boldsymbol{ω} _i = 0, and equations (2) and (3) for total angular
  momentum reduce to,L = R \times mV = I_R\boldsymbol{ω} _R.

Fixed center of mass

For the case of the center of mass fixed in space with respect to the
origin,

  V = 0,R \times MV = 0,I_R\boldsymbol{ω} _R = 0, and equations (2) and (3)
  for total angular momentum reduce to,L = Σ_i r_i \times m_iv_i = Σ_i
  I_i\boldsymbol{ω} _i.

Angular momentum (modern definition)

In modern (20th century) theoretical physics, angular momentum (not
including any intrinsic angular momentum – see below) is described using a
different formalism, instead of a classical pseudovector. In this
formalism, angular momentum is the 2-form Noether charge associated with
rotational invariance. As a result, angular momentum is not conserved for
general curved spacetimes, unless it happens to be asymptotically
rotationally invariant.

In classical mechanics, the angular momentum of a particle can be
reinterpreted as a plane element:

L = r ∧p ,

in which the exterior product ∧ replaces the cross product × (these
products have similar characteristics but are nonequivalent). This has the
advantage of a clearer geometric interpretation as a plane element, defined
from the x and p vectors, and the expression is true in any number of
dimensions (two or higher). In Cartesian coordinates:

\begin{array}{rl} L & =\left (xp_{y}-yp_{x}\right )e_{x}∧e_{y}+\left
(yp_{z}-zp_{y}\right )e_{y}∧e_{z}+\left (zp_{x}-xp_{z}\right )e_{z}∧e_{x} &
=L_{xy}e_{x}∧e_{y}+L_{yz}e_{y}∧e_{z}+L_{zx}e_{z}∧e_{x} , \end{array}

or more compactly in index notation:

L_{ij}=x_{i}p_{j}-x_{j}p_{i} .

The angular velocity can also be defined as an antisymmetric second order
tensor, with components ωij. The relation between the two antisymmetric
tensors is given by the moment of inertia which must now be a fourth order
tensor:²⁵

L_{ij} = I_{ijk\ell } ω_{k\ell } .

Again, this equation in L and ω as tensors is true in any number of
dimensions. This equation also appears in the geometric algebra formalism,
in which L and ω are bivectors, and the moment of inertia is a mapping
between them.

In relativistic mechanics, the relativistic angular momentum of a particle
is expressed as an antisymmetric tensor of second order:

M_{αβ} = X_α P_β- X_βP_α

in the language of four-vectors, namely the four position X and the four
momentum P, and absorbs the above L together with the motion of the centre
of mass of the particle.

In each of the above cases, for a system of particles, the total angular
momentum is just the sum of the individual particle angular momenta, and
the centre of mass is for the system.

Angular momentum in quantum mechanics

Main article: Angular momentum operator

Angular momentum in quantum mechanics differs in many profound respects
from angular momentum in classical mechanics. In relativistic quantum
mechanics, it differs even more, in which the above relativistic definition
becomes a tensorial operator.

Spin, orbital, and total angular momentum

Main article: Spin (physics)

The classical definition of angular momentum as L=r\times p can be carried
over to quantum mechanics, by reinterpreting r as the quantum position
operator and p as the quantum momentum operator. L is then an operator,
specifically called the orbital angular momentum operator.

However, in quantum physics, there is another type of angular momentum,
called spin angular momentum, represented by the spin operator S. Almost
all elementary particles have spin. Spin is often depicted as a particle
literally spinning around an axis, but this is a misleading and inaccurate
picture: spin is an intrinsic property of a particle, unrelated to any sort
of motion in space and fundamentally different from orbital angular
momentum. All elementary particles have a characteristic spin, for example
electrons always have "spin 1/2" (this actually means "spin ħ/2") while
photons always have "spin 1" (this actually means "spin ħ").

Finally, there is total angular momentum J, which combines both the spin
and orbital angular momentum of all particles and fields. (For one
particle, J = L + S.) Conservation of angular momentum applies to J, but
not to L or S; for example, the spin–orbit interaction allows angular
momentum to transfer back and forth between L and S, with the total
remaining constant.

Quantization

In quantum mechanics, angular momentum is quantized – that is, it cannot
vary continuously, but only in "quantum leaps" between certain allowed
values. For any system, the following restrictions on measurement results
apply, where \hbar is the reduced Planck constant and \hat{n} is any
direction vector such as x, y, or z:

(There are additional restrictions as well, see angular momentum operator
for details.)

The reduced Planck constant \hbar is tiny by everyday standards, about
10−34 J s, and therefore this quantization does not noticeably affect the
angular momentum of macroscopic objects. However, it is very important in
the microscopic world. For example, the structure of electron shells and
subshells in chemistry is significantly affected by the quantization of
angular momentum.

Quantization of angular momentum was first postulated by Niels Bohr in his
Bohr model of the atom and was later predicted by Erwin Schrödinger in his
Schrödinger equation.

Uncertainty

In the definition L=r\times p, six operators are involved: The position
operators rₓ, r_y, r_z, and the momentum operators pₓ, p_y, p_z. However,
the Heisenberg uncertainty principle tells us that it is not possible for
all six of these quantities to be known simultaneously with arbitrary
precision. Therefore, there are limits to what can be known or measured
about a particle's angular momentum. It turns out that the best that one
can do is to simultaneously measure both the angular momentum vector's
magnitude and its component along one axis.

The uncertainty is closely related to the fact that different components of
an angular momentum operator do not commute, for example L_xL_y \neq L_yLₓ.
(For the precise commutation relations, see angular momentum operator.)

Total angular momentum as generator of rotations

As mentioned above, orbital angular momentum L is defined as in classical
mechanics: L=r\times p, but total angular momentum J is defined in a
different, more basic way: J is defined as the "generator of rotations".²⁷
More specifically, J is defined so that the operator

R(\hat{n} ,ϕ) ≡\exp \left (-\frac{i}{\hbar } ϕ J·\hat{n} \right )

is the rotation operator that takes any system and rotates it by angle ϕ
about the axis \hat{n} . (The "exp" in the formula refers to operator
exponential)

The relationship between the angular momentum operator and the rotation
operators is the same as the relationship between lie algebras and lie
groups in mathematics. The close relationship between angular momentum and
rotations is reflected in Noether's theorem that proves that angular
momentum is conserved whenever the laws of physics are rotationally
invariant.

coefficients and Pauli–Lubanski pseudovector

Angular momentum in electrodynamics

See also: Momentum (Particle in field)

When describing the motion of a charged particle in an electromagnetic
field, the canonical momentum P (derived from the Lagrangian for this
system) is not gauge invariant. As a consequence, the canonical angular
momentum L = r × P is not gauge invariant either. Instead, the momentum
that is physical, the so-called kinetic momentum (used throughout this
article), is (in SI units)

p = mv = P - e A

where e is the electric charge of the particle and A the magnetic vector
potential of the electromagnetic field. The gauge-invariant angular
momentum, that is kinetic angular momentum, is given by

K= r \times ( P - eA )

The interplay with quantum mechanics is discussed further in the article on
canonical commutation relations.

History

Newton, in the Principia, hinted at angular momentum in his examples of the
First Law of Motion,

  A top, whose parts by their cohesion are perpetually drawn aside from
  rectilinear motions, does not cease its rotation, otherwise than as it is
  retarded by the air. The greater bodies of the planets and comets,
  meeting with less resistance in more free spaces, preserve their motions
  both progressive and circular for a much longer time.²⁸

He did not further investigate angular momentum directly in the Principia,

  From such kind of reflexions also sometimes arise the circular motions of
  bodies about their own centres. But these are cases which I do not
  consider in what follows; and it would be too tedious to demostrate every
  particular that relates to this subject.²⁹

However, his geometric proof of the Law of Areas is an outstanding example
of Newton's genius, and indirectly proves angular momentum conservation in
the case of a central force.

The Law of Areas

Main articles: Classical central-force problem and Areal velocity

Newton's derivation

As a planet orbits the Sun, the line between the Sun and the planet sweeps
out equal areas in equal intervals of time. This had been known since
Kepler expounded his Second Law of Planetary Motion. Newton derived a
unique geometric proof, and went on to show that the attractive force of
the Sun's gravity was the cause of all of Kepler's laws.

During the first interval of time, an object is in motion from point A to
point B. Undisturbed, it would continue to point c during the second
interval. When the object arrives at B, it receives an impulse directed
toward point S. The impulse gives it a small added velocity toward S, such
that if this were its only velocity, it would move from B to V during the
second interval. By the rules of velocity composition, these two velocities
add, and point C is found by construction of parallelogram BcCV. Thus the
object's path is deflected by the impulse so that it arrives at point C at
the end of the second interval. Because the triangles SBc and SBC have the
same base SB and the same height Bc or VC, they have the same area. By
symmetry, triangle SBc also has the same area as triangle SAB, therefore
the object has swept out equal areas SAB and SBC in equal times.

At point C, the object receives another impulse toward S, again deflecting
its path during the third interval from d to D. Thus it continues to E and
beyond, the triangles SAB, SBc, SBC, SCd, SCD, SDe, SDE all having the same
area. Allowing the time intervals to become ever smaller, the path ABCDE
approaches indefinitely close to a continuous curve.

Note that because this derivation is geometric, and no specific force is
applied, it proves a more general law than Kepler's Second Law of Planetary
Motion. It shows that the Law of Areas applies to any central force,
attractive or repulsive, continuous or non-continuous, or zero.

Conservation of angular momentum in the Law of Areas

The proportionality of angular momentum to the area swept out by a moving
object can be understood by realizing that the bases of the triangles, that
is, the lines from S to the object, are equivalent to the radius r, and
that the heights of the triangles are proportional to the perpendicular
component of velocity v⊥. Hence, if the area swept per unit time is
constant, then by the triangular area formula ¹/₂(base)(height), the
product (base)(height) and therefore the product rv⊥ are constant: if r and
the base length are decreased, v⊥ and height must increase proportionally.
Mass is constant, therefore angular momentum rmv⊥ is conserved by this
exchange of distance and velocity.

In the case of triangle SBC, area is equal to ¹/₂(SB)(VC). Wherever C is
eventually located due to the impulse applied at B, the product (SB)(VC),
and therefore rmv⊥ remain constant. Similarly so for each of the triangles.

After Newton

Leonhard Euler, Daniel Bernoulli, and Patrick d'Arcy all understood angular
momentum in terms of conservation of areal velocity, a result of their
analysis of Kepler's Second Law of planetary motion. It is unlikely that
they realized the implications for ordinary rotating matter.³⁰

In 1736 Euler, like Newton, touched on some of the equations of angular
momentum in his Mechanica without further developing them.³¹

Bernoulli wrote in a 1744 letter of a "moment of rotational motion",
possibly the first conception of angular momentum as we now understand
it.³²

In 1799, Pierre-Simon Laplace first realized that a fixed plane was
associated with rotation - his invariable plane.

Louis Poinsot in 1803 began representing rotations as a line segment
perpendicular to the rotation, and elaborated on the "conservation of
moments".

In 1852 Léon Foucault used a gyroscope in an experiment to display the
Earth's rotation.

William J. M. Rankine's 1858 Manual of Applied Mechanics defined angular
momentum in the modern sense for the first time:

  ...a line whose length is proportional to the magnitude of the angular
  momentum, and whose direction is perpendicular to the plane of motion of
  the body and of the fixed point, and such, that when the motion of the
  body is viewed from the extremity of the line, the radius-vector of the
  body seems to have right-handed rotation.

In an 1872 edition of the same book, Rankine stated that "The term angular
momentum was introduced by Mr. Hayward,"³³ probably referring to R.B.
Hayward's article On a Direct Method of estimating Velocities,
Accelerations, and all similar Quantities with respect to Axes moveable in
any manner in Space with Applications,³⁴ which was introduced in 1856, and
published in 1864. Rankine was mistaken, as numerous publications feature
the term starting in the late 18th to early 19th centuries.³⁵ However,
Hayward's article apparently was the first use of the term and the concept
seen by much of the English-speaking world. Before this, angular momentum
was typically referred to as "momentum of rotation" in English.³⁶

Astronomy

This article is about the scientific study of celestial objects. For other
uses, see Astronomy (disambiguation).

Astronomy is a natural science which is the study of celestial objects
(such as stars, galaxies, planets, moons, asteroids, comets and nebulae),
the physics, chemistry, and evolution of such objects, and phenomena that
originate outside the atmosphere of Earth, including supernovae explosions,
gamma ray bursts, and cosmic microwave background radiation. A related but
distinct subject, physical cosmology, is concerned with studying the
universe as a whole.¹

Astronomy is one of the oldest sciences. The early civilizations in
recorded history, such as the Babylonians, Greeks, Indians, Egyptians,
Nubians, Iranians, Chinese, and Maya performed methodical observations of
the night sky. However, the invention of the telescope was required before
astronomy was able to develop into a modern science. Historically,
astronomy has included disciplines as diverse as astrometry, celestial
navigation, observational astronomy and the making of calendars, but
professional astronomy is nowadays often considered to be synonymous with
astrophysics.²

During the 20th century, the field of professional astronomy split into
observational and theoretical branches. Observational astronomy is focused
on acquiring data from observations of astronomical objects, which is then
analyzed using basic principles of physics. Theoretical astronomy is
oriented toward the development of computer or analytical models to
describe astronomical objects and phenomena. The two fields complement each
other, with theoretical astronomy seeking to explain the observational
results and observations being used to confirm theoretical results.

Astronomy is one of the few sciences where amateurs can still play an
active role, especially in the discovery and observation of transient
phenomena. Amateur astronomers have made and contributed to many important
astronomical discoveries.

Etymology

Astronomy (from the Greek ἀστρονομία from ἄστρον astron, "star" and -νομία
-nomia from νόμος nomos, "law" or "culture") means "law of the stars" (or
"culture of the stars" depending on the translation). Astronomy should not
be confused with astrology, the belief system which claims that human
affairs are correlated with the positions of celestial objects.⁵ Although
the two fields share a common origin they are now entirely distinct.⁶

Use of terms "astronomy" and "astrophysics"

Generally, either the term "astronomy" or "astrophysics" may be used to
refer to this subject.⁷ ⁸ ⁹ Based on strict dictionary definitions,
"astronomy" refers to "the study of objects and matter outside the Earth's
atmosphere and of their physical and chemical properties"¹⁰ and
"astrophysics" refers to the branch of astronomy dealing with "the
behavior, physical properties, and dynamic processes of celestial objects
and phenomena".¹¹ In some cases, as in the introduction of the introductory
textbook The Physical Universe by Frank Shu, "astronomy" may be used to
describe the qualitative study of the subject, whereas "astrophysics" is
used to describe the physics-oriented version of the subject.¹² However,
since most modern astronomical research deals with subjects related to
physics, modern astronomy could actually be called astrophysics.⁷ Few
fields, such as astrometry, are purely astronomy rather than also
astrophysics. Various departments in which scientists carry out research on
this subject may use "astronomy" and "astrophysics," partly depending on
whether the department is historically affiliated with a physics
department,⁸ and many professional astronomers have physics rather than
astronomy degrees.⁹ One of the leading scientific journals in the field is
the European journal named Astronomy and Astrophysics. The leading American
journals are The Astrophysical Journal and The Astronomical Journal.

History

Main article: History of astronomy
Further information: Archaeoastronomy and List of astronomers

In early times, astronomy only comprised the observation and predictions of
the motions of objects visible to the naked eye. In some locations, early
cultures assembled massive artifacts that possibly had some astronomical
purpose. In addition to their ceremonial uses, these observatories could be
employed to determine the seasons, an important factor in knowing when to
plant crops, as well as in understanding the length of the year.¹³

Before tools such as the telescope were invented, early study of the stars
was conducted using the naked eye. As civilizations developed, most notably
in Mesopotamia, Greece, India, China, Egypt, and Central America,
astronomical observatories were assembled, and ideas on the nature of the
universe began to be explored. Most of early astronomy actually consisted
of mapping the positions of the stars and planets, a science now referred
to as astrometry. From these observations, early ideas about the motions of
the planets were formed, and the nature of the Sun, Moon and the Earth in
the universe were explored philosophically. The Earth was believed to be
the center of the universe with the Sun, the Moon and the stars rotating
around it. This is known as the geocentric model of the universe, or the
Ptolemaic system, named after Ptolemy.¹⁴

A particularly important early development was the beginning of
mathematical and scientific astronomy, which began among the Babylonians,
who laid the foundations for the later astronomical traditions that
developed in many other civilizations.¹⁵ The Babylonians discovered that
lunar eclipses recurred in a repeating cycle known as a saros.¹⁶

Following the Babylonians, significant advances in astronomy were made in
ancient Greece and the Hellenistic world. Greek astronomy is characterized
from the start by seeking a rational, physical explanation for celestial
phenomena.¹⁷ In the 3rd century BC, Aristarchus of Samos estimated the size
and distance of the Moon and Sun, and was the first to propose a
heliocentric model of the solar system.¹⁸ In the 2nd century BC, Hipparchus
discovered precession, calculated the size and distance of the Moon and
invented the earliest known astronomical devices such as the astrolabe.¹⁹
Hipparchus also created a comprehensive catalog of 1020 stars, and most of
the constellations of the northern hemisphere derive from Greek
astronomy.²⁰ The Antikythera mechanism (c. 150–80 BC) was an early analog
computer designed to calculate the location of the Sun, Moon, and planets
for a given date. Technological artifacts of similar complexity did not
reappear until the 14th century, when mechanical astronomical clocks
appeared in Europe.²¹

During the Middle Ages, astronomy was mostly stagnant in medieval Europe,
at least until the 13th century. However, astronomy flourished in the
Islamic world and other parts of the world. This led to the emergence of
the first astronomical observatories in the Muslim world by the early 9th
century.²² ²³ ²⁴ In 964, the Andromeda Galaxy, the largest galaxy in the
Local Group, was discovered by the Persian astronomer Azophi and first
described in his Book of Fixed Stars.²⁵ The SN 1006 supernova, the
brightest apparent magnitude stellar event in recorded history, was
observed by the Egyptian Arabic astronomer Ali ibn Ridwan and the Chinese
astronomers in 1006. Some of the prominent Islamic (mostly Persian and
Arab) astronomers who made significant contributions to the science include
Al-Battani, Thebit, Azophi, Albumasar, Biruni, Arzachel, Al-Birjandi, and
the astronomers of the Maragheh and Samarkand observatories. Astronomers
during that time introduced many Arabic names now used for individual
stars.²⁶ ²⁷ It is also believed that the ruins at Great Zimbabwe and
Timbuktu²⁸ may have housed an astronomical observatory.²⁹ Europeans had
previously believed that there had been no astronomical observation in
pre-colonial Middle Ages sub-Saharan Africa but modern discoveries show
otherwise.³⁰ ³¹ ³² ³³

The Roman Catholic Church gave more financial and social support to the
study of astronomy for over six centuries, from the recovery of ancient
learning during the late Middle Ages into the Enlightenment, than any
other, and, probably, all other, institutions. Among the Church's motives
was finding the date for Easter.³⁴

Scientific revolution

During the Renaissance, Nicolaus Copernicus proposed a heliocentric model
of the solar system. His work was defended, expanded upon, and corrected by
Galileo Galilei and Johannes Kepler. Galileo used telescopes to enhance his
observations.³⁵

Kepler was the first to devise a system that described correctly the
details of the motion of the planets with the Sun at the center. However,
Kepler did not succeed in formulating a theory behind the laws he wrote
down.³⁶ It was left to Newton's invention of celestial dynamics and his law
of gravitation to finally explain the motions of the planets. Newton also
developed the reflecting telescope.³⁵

Further discoveries paralleled the improvements in the size and quality of
the telescope. More extensive star catalogues were produced by Lacaille.
The astronomer William Herschel made a detailed catalog of nebulosity and
clusters, and in 1781 discovered the planet Uranus, the first new planet
found.³⁷ The distance to a star was first announced in 1838 when the
parallax of 61 Cygni was measured by Friedrich Bessel.³⁸

During the 18–19th centuries, attention to the three body problem by Euler,
Clairaut, and D'Alembert led to more accurate predictions about the motions
of the Moon and planets. This work was further refined by Lagrange and
Laplace, allowing the masses of the planets and moons to be estimated from
their perturbations.³⁹

Significant advances in astronomy came about with the introduction of new
technology, including the spectroscope and photography. Fraunhofer
discovered about 600 bands in the spectrum of the Sun in 1814–15, which, in
1859, Kirchhoff ascribed to the presence of different elements. Stars were
proven to be similar to the Earth's own Sun, but with a wide range of
temperatures, masses, and sizes.²⁶

The existence of the Earth's galaxy, the Milky Way, as a separate group of
stars, was only proved in the 20th century, along with the existence of
"external" galaxies, and soon after, the expansion of the Universe, seen in
the recession of most galaxies from us.⁴⁰ Modern astronomy has also
discovered many exotic objects such as quasars, pulsars, blazars, and radio
galaxies, and has used these observations to develop physical theories
which describe some of these objects in terms of equally exotic objects
such as black holes and neutron stars. Physical cosmology made huge
advances during the 20th century, with the model of the Big Bang heavily
supported by the evidence provided by astronomy and physics, such as the
cosmic microwave background radiation, Hubble's law, and cosmological
abundances of elements. Space telescopes have enabled measurements in parts
of the electromagnetic spectrum normally blocked or blurred by the
atmosphere.

Observational astronomy

Main article: Observational astronomy

In astronomy, the main source of information about celestial bodies and
other objects is visible light or more generally electromagnetic
radiation.⁴¹ Observational astronomy may be divided according to the
observed region of the electromagnetic spectrum. Some parts of the spectrum
can be observed from the Earth's surface, while other parts are only
observable from either high altitudes or outside the Earth's atmosphere.
Specific information on these subfields is given below.

Radio astronomy

Main article: Radio astronomy

Radio astronomy studies radiation with wavelengths greater than
approximately one millimeter.⁴² Radio astronomy is different from most
other forms of observational astronomy in that the observed radio waves can
be treated as waves rather than as discrete photons. Hence, it is
relatively easier to measure both the amplitude and phase of radio waves,
whereas this is not as easily done at shorter wavelengths.⁴²

Although some radio waves are produced by astronomical objects in the form
of thermal emission, most of the radio emission that is observed from Earth
is the result of synchrotron radiation, which is produced when electrons
orbit magnetic fields.⁴² Additionally, a number of spectral lines produced
by interstellar gas, notably the hydrogen spectral line at 21 cm, are
observable at radio wavelengths.¹² ⁴²

A wide variety of objects are observable at radio wavelengths, including
supernovae, interstellar gas, pulsars, and active galactic nuclei.¹² ⁴²

Infrared astronomy

Main article: Infrared astronomy

Infrared astronomy is founded on the detection and analysis of infrared
radiation (wavelengths longer than red light). The infrared spectrum is
useful for studying objects that are too cold to radiate visible light,
such as planets, circumstellar disks or nebulae whose light is blocked by
dust. Longer infrared wavelengths can penetrate clouds of dust that block
visible light, allowing the observation of young stars in molecular clouds
and the cores of galaxies. Observations from the Wide-field Infrared Survey
Explorer (WISE) have been particularly effective at unveiling numerous
Galactic protostars and their host star clusters.⁴⁴ ⁴⁵ With the exception
of wavelengths close to visible light, infrared radiation is heavily
absorbed by the atmosphere, or masked, as the atmosphere itself produces
significant infrared emission. Consequently, infrared observatories have to
be located in high, dry places or in space.⁴⁶ Some molecules radiate
strongly in the infrared. This allows the study the chemistry of space;
more specifically it can detect water in comets.⁴⁷

Optical astronomy

Main article: Optical astronomy

Historically, optical astronomy, also called visible light astronomy, is
the oldest form of astronomy.⁴⁸ Optical images of observations were
originally drawn by hand. In the late 19th century and most of the 20th
century, images were made using photographic equipment. Modern images are
made using digital detectors, particularly detectors using charge-coupled
devices (CCDs) and recorded on modern medium. Although visible light itself
extends from approximately 4000 Å to 7000 Å (400 nm to 700 nm),⁴⁸ that same
equipment can be used to observe some near-ultraviolet and near-infrared
radiation.

Ultraviolet astronomy

Main article: Ultraviolet astronomy

Ultraviolet astronomy refers to observations at ultraviolet wavelengths
between approximately 100 and 3200 Å (10 to 320 nm).⁴² Light at these
wavelengths is absorbed by the Earth's atmosphere, so observations at these
wavelengths must be performed from the upper atmosphere or from space.
Ultraviolet astronomy is best suited to the study of thermal radiation and
spectral emission lines from hot blue stars (OB stars) that are very bright
in this wave band. This includes the blue stars in other galaxies, which
have been the targets of several ultraviolet surveys. Other objects
commonly observed in ultraviolet light include planetary nebulae, supernova
remnants, and active galactic nuclei.⁴² However, as ultraviolet light is
easily absorbed by interstellar dust, an appropriate adjustment of
ultraviolet measurements is necessary.⁴²

X-ray astronomy

Main article: X-ray astronomy

X-ray astronomy is the study of astronomical objects at X-ray wavelengths.
Typically, X-ray radiation is produced by synchrotron emission (the result
of electrons orbiting magnetic field lines), thermal emission from thin
gases above 10⁷ (10 million) kelvins, and thermal emission from thick gases
above 10⁷ Kelvin.⁴² Since X-rays are absorbed by the Earth's atmosphere,
all X-ray observations must be performed from high-altitude balloons,
rockets, or spacecraft. Notable X-ray sources include X-ray binaries,
pulsars, supernova remnants, elliptical galaxies, clusters of galaxies, and
active galactic nuclei.⁴²

X-rays were first observed and documented in 1895 by Wilhelm Conrad
Röntgen, a German scientist who found them when experimenting with vacuum
tubes. Through a series of experiments, Röntgen was able to discover the
beginning elements of radiation. The "X", in fact, holds its own
significance, as it represents Röntgen's inability to identify exactly the
type of radiation.

Gamma-ray astronomy

Main article: Gamma ray astronomy

Gamma ray astronomy is the study of astronomical objects at the shortest
wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum. Gamma rays may be observed
directly by satellites such as the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory or by
specialized telescopes called atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes.⁴² The
Cherenkov telescopes do not actually detect the gamma rays directly but
instead detect the flashes of visible light produced when gamma rays are
absorbed by the Earth's atmosphere.⁴⁹

Most gamma-ray emitting sources are actually gamma-ray bursts, objects
which only produce gamma radiation for a few milliseconds to thousands of
seconds before fading away. Only 10% of gamma-ray sources are non-transient
sources. These steady gamma-ray emitters include pulsars, neutron stars,
and black hole candidates such as active galactic nuclei.⁴²

Fields not based on the electromagnetic spectrum

In addition to electromagnetic radiation, a few other events originating
from great distances may be observed from the Earth.

In neutrino astronomy, astronomers use heavily shielded underground
facilities such as SAGE, GALLEX, and Kamioka II/III for the detection of
neutrinos. The vast majority of the neutrinos streaming through the Earth
originate from the Sun, but 24 neutrinos were also detected from supernova
1987A.⁴² Cosmic rays, which consist of very high energy particles that can
decay or be absorbed when they enter the Earth's atmosphere, result in a
cascade of particles which can be detected by current observatories.⁵⁰
Additionally, some future neutrino detectors may also be sensitive to the
particles produced when cosmic rays hit the Earth's atmosphere.⁴²

Gravitational wave astronomy is an emerging new field of astronomy which
aims to use gravitational wave detectors to collect observational data
about compact objects. A few observatories have been constructed, such as
the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Observatory LIGO, but gravitational
waves are extremely difficult to detect.⁵¹

Combining observations made using electromagnetic radiation, neutrinos or
gravitational waves with those made using a different means, which shall
give complementary information, is known as multi-messenger astronomy.⁵²

Astrometry and celestial mechanics

Main articles: Astrometry and Celestial mechanics

One of the oldest fields in astronomy, and in all of science, is the
measurement of the positions of celestial objects. Historically, accurate
knowledge of the positions of the Sun, Moon, planets and stars has been
essential in celestial navigation (the use of celestial objects to guide
navigation) and in the making of calendars.

Careful measurement of the positions of the planets has led to a solid
understanding of gravitational perturbations, and an ability to determine
past and future positions of the planets with great accuracy, a field known
as celestial mechanics. More recently the tracking of near-Earth objects
will allow for predictions of close encounters, and potential collisions,
with the Earth.⁵³

The measurement of stellar parallax of nearby stars provides a fundamental
baseline in the cosmic distance ladder that is used to measure the scale of
the universe. Parallax measurements of nearby stars provide an absolute
baseline for the properties of more distant stars, as their properties can
be compared. Measurements of radial velocity and proper motion plot the
movement of these systems through the Milky Way galaxy. Astrometric results
are the basis used to calculate the distribution of dark matter in the
galaxy.⁵⁴

During the 1990s, the measurement of the stellar wobble of nearby stars was
used to detect large extrasolar planets orbiting nearby stars.⁵⁵

Theoretical astronomy

Main article: Theoretical astronomy

Theoretical astronomers use several tools including analytical models (for
example, polytropes to approximate the behaviors of a star) and
computational numerical simulations. Each has some advantages. Analytical
models of a process are generally better for giving insight into the heart
of what is going on. Numerical models reveal the existence of phenomena and
effects otherwise unobserved.⁵⁶ ⁵⁷

Theorists in astronomy endeavor to create theoretical models and from the
results predict observational consequences of those models. The observation
of a phenomenon predicted by a model allows astronomers to select between
several alternate or conflicting models.

Theorists also try to generate or modify models to take into account new
data. In the case of an inconsistency, the general tendency is to try to
make minimal modifications to the model so that it produces results that
fit the data. In some cases, a large amount of inconsistent data over time
may lead to total abandonment of a model.

Topics studied by theoretical astronomers include: stellar dynamics and
evolution; galaxy formation; large-scale structure of matter in the
Universe; origin of cosmic rays; general relativity and physical cosmology,
including string cosmology and astroparticle physics. Astrophysical
relativity serves as a tool to gauge the properties of large scale
structures for which gravitation plays a significant role in physical
phenomena investigated and as the basis for black hole (astro)physics and
the study of gravitational waves.

Some widely accepted and studied theories and models in astronomy, now
included in the Lambda-CDM model are the Big Bang, Cosmic inflation, dark
matter, and fundamental theories of physics.

A few examples of this process:

Dark matter and dark energy are the current leading topics in astronomy,⁵⁸
as their discovery and controversy originated during the study of the
galaxies.

Specific subfields

Solar astronomy

Main article: Sun
See also: Solar telescope

At a distance of about eight light-minutes, the most frequently studied
star is the Sun, a typical main-sequence dwarf star of stellar class G2 V,
and about 4.6 billion years (Gyr) old. The Sun is not considered a variable
star, but it does undergo periodic changes in activity known as the sunspot
cycle. This is an 11-year fluctuation in sunspot numbers. Sunspots are
regions of lower-than- average temperatures that are associated with
intense magnetic activity.⁵⁹

The Sun has steadily increased in luminosity over the course of its life,
increasing by 40% since it first became a main-sequence star. The Sun has
also undergone periodic changes in luminosity that can have a significant
impact on the Earth.⁶⁰ The Maunder minimum, for example, is believed to
have caused the Little Ice Age phenomenon during the Middle Ages.⁶¹

The visible outer surface of the Sun is called the photosphere. Above this
layer is a thin region known as the chromosphere. This is surrounded by a
transition region of rapidly increasing temperatures, and finally by the
super-heated corona.

At the center of the Sun is the core region, a volume of sufficient
temperature and pressure for nuclear fusion to occur. Above the core is the
radiation zone, where the plasma conveys the energy flux by means of
radiation. Above that are the outer layers that form a convection zone
where the gas material transports energy primarily through physical
displacement of the gas. It is believed that this convection zone creates
the magnetic activity that generates sunspots.⁵⁹

A solar wind of plasma particles constantly streams outward from the Sun
until, at the outermost limit of the Solar System, it reaches the
heliopause. This solar wind interacts with the magnetosphere of the Earth
to create the Van Allen radiation belts about the Earth, as well as the
aurora where the lines of the Earth's magnetic field descend into the
atmosphere.⁶²

Planetary science

Main articles: Planetary science and Planetary geology

Planetary science is the study of the assemblage of planets, moons, dwarf
planets, comets, asteroids, and other bodies orbiting the Sun, as well as
extrasolar planets. The Solar System has been relatively well-studied,
initially through telescopes and then later by spacecraft. This has
provided a good overall understanding of the formation and evolution of
this planetary system, although many new discoveries are still being
made.⁶³

The Solar System is subdivided into the inner planets, the asteroid belt,
and the outer planets. The inner terrestrial planets consist of Mercury,
Venus, Earth, and Mars. The outer gas giant planets are Jupiter, Saturn,
Uranus, and Neptune.⁶⁴ Beyond Neptune lies the Kuiper Belt, and finally the
Oort Cloud, which may extend as far as a light-year.

The planets were formed in the protoplanetary disk that surrounded the
early Sun. Through a process that included gravitational attraction,
collision, and accretion, the disk formed clumps of matter that, with time,
became protoplanets. The radiation pressure of the solar wind then expelled
most of the unaccreted matter, and only those planets with sufficient mass
retained their gaseous atmosphere. The planets continued to sweep up, or
eject, the remaining matter during a period of intense bombardment,
evidenced by the many impact craters on the Moon. During this period, some
of the protoplanets may have collided, the leading hypothesis for how the
Moon was formed.⁶⁵

Once a planet reaches sufficient mass, the materials of different densities
segregate within, during planetary differentiation. This process can form a
stony or metallic core, surrounded by a mantle and an outer surface. The
core may include solid and liquid regions, and some planetary cores
generate their own magnetic field, which can protect their atmospheres from
solar wind stripping.⁶⁶

A planet or moon's interior heat is produced from the collisions that
created the body, radioactive materials (e.g. uranium, thorium, and ²⁶Al),
or tidal heating. Some planets and moons accumulate enough heat to drive
geologic processes such as volcanism and tectonics. Those that accumulate
or retain an atmosphere can also undergo surface erosion from wind or
water. Smaller bodies, without tidal heating, cool more quickly; and their
geological activity ceases with the exception of impact cratering.⁶⁷

Stellar astronomy

Main article: Star

The study of stars and stellar evolution is fundamental to our
understanding of the universe. The astrophysics of stars has been
determined through observation and theoretical understanding; and from
computer simulations of the interior.⁶⁸ Star formation occurs in dense
regions of dust and gas, known as giant molecular clouds. When
destabilized, cloud fragments can collapse under the influence of gravity,
to form a protostar. A sufficiently dense, and hot, core region will
trigger nuclear fusion, thus creating a main-sequence star.⁶⁹

Almost all elements heavier than hydrogen and helium were created inside
the cores of stars.⁶⁸

The characteristics of the resulting star depend primarily upon its
starting mass. The more massive the star, the greater its luminosity, and
the more rapidly it expends the hydrogen fuel in its core. Over time, this
hydrogen fuel is completely converted into helium, and the star begins to
evolve. The fusion of helium requires a higher core temperature, so that
the star both expands in size, and increases in core density. The resulting
red giant enjoys a brief life span, before the helium fuel is in turn
consumed. Very massive stars can also undergo a series of decreasing
evolutionary phases, as they fuse increasingly heavier elements.⁷⁰

The final fate of the star depends on its mass, with stars of mass greater
than about eight times the Sun becoming core collapse supernovae;⁷¹ while
smaller stars form a white dwarf as it ejects matter that forms a planetary
nebulae.⁷² The remnant of a supernova is a dense neutron star, or, if the
stellar mass was at least three times that of the Sun, a black hole.⁷³
Close binary stars can follow more complex evolutionary paths, such as mass
transfer onto a white dwarf companion that can potentially cause a
supernova.⁷⁴ Planetary nebulae and supernovae are necessary for the
distribution of metals to the interstellar medium; without them, all new
stars (and their planetary systems) would be formed from hydrogen and
helium alone.⁷⁵

Galactic astronomy

Main article: Galactic astronomy

Our solar system orbits within the Milky Way, a barred spiral galaxy that
is a prominent member of the Local Group of galaxies. It is a rotating mass
of gas, dust, stars and other objects, held together by mutual
gravitational attraction. As the Earth is located within the dusty outer
arms, there are large portions of the Milky Way that are obscured from
view.

In the center of the Milky Way is the core, a bar-shaped bulge with what is
believed to be a supermassive black hole at the center. This is surrounded
by four primary arms that spiral from the core. This is a region of active
star formation that contains many younger, population I stars. The disk is
surrounded by a spheroid halo of older, population II stars, as well as
relatively dense concentrations of stars known as globular clusters.⁷⁶

Between the stars lies the interstellar medium, a region of sparse matter.
In the densest regions, molecular clouds of molecular hydrogen and other
elements create star-forming regions. These begin as a compact pre-stellar
core or dark nebulae, which concentrate and collapse (in volumes determined
by the Jeans length) to form compact protostars.⁶⁹

As the more massive stars appear, they transform the cloud into an H II
region (ionized atomic hydrogen) of glowing gas and plasma. The stellar
wind and supernova explosions from these stars eventually cause the cloud
to disperse, often leaving behind one or more young open clusters of stars.
These clusters gradually disperse, and the stars join the population of the
Milky Way.⁷⁷

Kinematic studies of matter in the Milky Way and other galaxies have
demonstrated that there is more mass than can be accounted for by visible
matter. A dark matter halo appears to dominate the mass, although the
nature of this dark matter remains undetermined.⁷⁸

Extragalactic astronomy

Main article: Extragalactic astronomy

The study of objects outside our galaxy is a branch of astronomy concerned
with the formation and evolution of Galaxies; their morphology
(description) and classification; and the observation of active galaxies,
and at a larger scale, the groups and clusters of galaxies. Finally, the
latter is important for the understanding of the large-scale structure of
the cosmos.

Most galaxies are organized into distinct shapes that allow for
classification schemes. They are commonly divided into spiral, elliptical
and Irregular galaxies.⁷⁹

As the name suggests, an elliptical galaxy has the cross-sectional shape of
an ellipse. The stars move along random orbits with no preferred direction.
These galaxies contain little or no interstellar dust; few star-forming
regions; and generally older stars. Elliptical galaxies are more commonly
found at the core of galactic clusters, and may have been formed through
mergers of large galaxies.

A spiral galaxy is organized into a flat, rotating disk, usually with a
prominent bulge or bar at the center, and trailing bright arms that spiral
outward. The arms are dusty regions of star formation where massive young
stars produce a blue tint. Spiral galaxies are typically surrounded by a
halo of older stars. Both the Milky Way and our nearest galaxy neighbor,
the Andromeda Galaxy, are spiral galaxies.

Irregular galaxies are chaotic in appearance, and are neither spiral nor
elliptical. About a quarter of all galaxies are irregular, and the peculiar
shapes of such galaxies may be the result of gravitational interaction.

An active galaxy is a formation that emits a significant amount of its
energy from a source other than its stars, dust and gas. It is powered by a
compact region at the core, thought to be a super-massive black hole that
is emitting radiation from in-falling material.

A radio galaxy is an active galaxy that is very luminous in the radio
portion of the spectrum, and is emitting immense plumes or lobes of gas.
Active galaxies that emit shorter frequency, high-energy radiation include
Seyfert galaxies, Quasars, and Blazars. Quasars are believed to be the most
consistently luminous objects in the known universe.⁸⁰

The large-scale structure of the cosmos is represented by groups and
clusters of galaxies. This structure is organized into a hierarchy of
groupings, with the largest being the superclusters. The collective matter
is formed into filaments and walls, leaving large voids between.⁸¹

Cosmology

Main article: Physical cosmology

Cosmology (from the Greek κόσμος (kosmos) "world, universe" and λόγος
(logos) "word, study" or literally "logic") could be considered the study
of the universe as a whole.

Observations of the large-scale structure of the universe, a branch known
as physical cosmology, have provided a deep understanding of the formation
and evolution of the cosmos. Fundamental to modern cosmology is the
well-accepted theory of the big bang, wherein our universe began at a
single point in time, and thereafter expanded over the course of 13.8
billion years⁸² to its present condition.⁸³ The concept of the big bang can
be traced back to the discovery of the microwave background radiation in
1965.⁸³

In the course of this expansion, the universe underwent several
evolutionary stages. In the very early moments, it is theorized that the
universe experienced a very rapid cosmic inflation, which homogenized the
starting conditions. Thereafter, nucleosynthesis produced the elemental
abundance of the early universe.⁸³ (See also nucleocosmochronology.)

When the first neutral atoms formed from a sea of primordial ions, space
became transparent to radiation, releasing the energy viewed today as the
microwave background radiation. The expanding universe then underwent a
Dark Age due to the lack of stellar energy sources.⁸⁴

A hierarchical structure of matter began to form from minute variations in
the mass density of space. Matter accumulated in the densest regions,
forming clouds of gas and the earliest stars, the Population III stars.
These massive stars triggered the reionization process and are believed to
have created many of the heavy elements in the early universe, which,
through nuclear decay, create lighter elements, allowing the cycle of
nucleosynthesis to continue longer.⁸⁵

Gravitational aggregations clustered into filaments, leaving voids in the
gaps. Gradually, organizations of gas and dust merged to form the first
primitive galaxies. Over time, these pulled in more matter, and were often
organized into groups and clusters of galaxies, then into larger-scale
superclusters.⁸⁶

Fundamental to the structure of the universe is the existence of dark
matter and dark energy. These are now thought to be its dominant
components, forming 96% of the mass of the universe. For this reason, much
effort is expended in trying to understand the physics of these
components.⁸⁷

Interdisciplinary studies

Astronomy and astrophysics have developed significant interdisciplinary
links with other major scientific fields. Archaeoastronomy is the study of
ancient or traditional astronomies in their cultural context, utilizing
archaeological and anthropological evidence. Astrobiology is the study of
the advent and evolution of biological systems in the universe, with
particular emphasis on the possibility of non-terrestrial life.
Astrostatistics is the application of statistics to astrophysics to the
analysis of vast amount of observational astrophysical data.

The study of chemicals found in space, including their formation,
interaction and destruction, is called astrochemistry. These substances are
usually found in molecular clouds, although they may also appear in low
temperature stars, brown dwarfs and planets. Cosmochemistry is the study of
the chemicals found within the Solar System, including the origins of the
elements and variations in the isotope ratios. Both of these fields
represent an overlap of the disciplines of astronomy and chemistry. As
"forensic astronomy", finally, methods from astronomy have been used to
solve problems of law and history.

Amateur astronomy

Main article: Amateur astronomy

Astronomy is one of the sciences to which amateurs can contribute the
most.⁸⁸

Collectively, amateur astronomers observe a variety of celestial objects
and phenomena sometimes with equipment that they build themselves. Common
targets of amateur astronomers include the Moon, planets, stars, comets,
meteor showers, and a variety of deep-sky objects such as star clusters,
galaxies, and nebulae. Astronomy clubs are located throughout the world and
many have programs to help their members set up and complete observational
programs including those to observe all the objects in the Messier (110
objects) or Herschal 400 catalogues of points of interest in the night sky.
One branch of amateur astronomy, amateur astrophotography, involves the
taking of photos of the night sky. Many amateurs like to specialize in the
observation of particular objects, types of objects, or types of events
which interest them.⁸⁹ ⁹⁰

Most amateurs work at visible wavelengths, but a small minority experiment
with wavelengths outside the visible spectrum. This includes the use of
infrared filters on conventional telescopes, and also the use of radio
telescopes. The pioneer of amateur radio astronomy was Karl Jansky, who
started observing the sky at radio wavelengths in the 1930s. A number of
amateur astronomers use either homemade telescopes or use radio telescopes
which were originally built for astronomy research but which are now
available to amateurs (e.g. the One-Mile Telescope).⁹¹ ⁹²

Amateur astronomers continue to make scientific contributions to the field
of astronomy and it is one of the few scientific disciplines where amateurs
can still make significant contributions. Amateurs can make occultation
measurements that are used to refine the orbits of minor planets. They can
also discover comets, and perform regular observations of variable stars.
Improvements in digital technology have allowed amateurs to make impressive
advances in the field of astrophotography.⁹³ ⁹⁴ ⁹⁵

Unsolved problems in astronomy

See also: Unsolved problems in physics

Although the scientific discipline of astronomy has made tremendous strides
in understanding the nature of the universe and its contents, there remain
some important unanswered questions. Answers to these may require the
construction of new ground- and space-based instruments, and possibly new
developments in theoretical and experimental physics.

- What is the origin of the stellar mass spectrum? That is, why do
  astronomers observe the same distribution of stellar masses – the initial
  mass function – apparently regardless of the initial conditions?⁹⁶ A
  deeper understanding of the formation of stars and planets is needed.
- Is there other life in the Universe? Especially, is there other
  intelligent life? If so, what is the explanation for the Fermi paradox?
  The existence of life elsewhere has important scientific and
  philosophical implications.⁹⁷ ⁹⁸ Is the Solar System normal or atypical?
- What caused the Universe to form? Is the premise of the Fine-tuned
  universe hypothesis correct? If so, could this be the result of
  cosmological natural selection? What caused the cosmic inflation that
  produced our homogeneous universe? Why is there a baryon asymmetry?
- What is the nature of dark matter and dark energy? These dominate the
  evolution and fate of the cosmos, yet their true nature remains
  unknown.⁹⁹ What will be the ultimate fate of the universe?¹⁰⁰
- How did the first galaxies form?¹⁰¹ How did supermassive black holes
  form?¹⁰²
- What is creating the ultra-high-energy cosmic rays?
- Why is the abundance of lithium in the cosmos four times lower than
  predicted by the standard Big Bang model?¹⁰³
- What really happens beyond the event horizon?¹⁰⁴

Atom

For other uses, see Atom (disambiguation).

An atom is the smallest constituent unit of ordinary matter that has the
properties of a chemical element.¹ Every solid, liquid, gas, and plasma is
made up of neutral or ionized atoms. Atoms are very small; typical sizes
are around 100 pm (a ten-billionth of a meter, in the short scale).²
However, atoms do not have well defined boundaries, and there are different
ways to define their size which give different but close values.

Atoms are small enough that classical physics give noticeably incorrect
results. Through the development of physics, atomic models have
incorporated quantum principles to better explain and predict the behavior.

Every atom is composed of a nucleus and one or more electrons bound to the
nucleus. The nucleus is made of one or more protons and typically a similar
number of neutrons (none in hydrogen-1). Protons and neutrons are called
nucleons. Over 99.94% of the atom's mass is in the nucleus. The protons
have a positive electric charge, the electrons have a negative electric
charge, and the neutrons have no electric charge. If the number of protons
and electrons are equal, that atom is electrically neutral. If an atom has
more or fewer electrons than protons, then it has an overall negative or
positive charge, respectively, and it is called an ion.

Electrons of an atom are attracted to the protons in an atomic nucleus by
this electromagnetic force. The protons and neutrons in the nucleus are
attracted to each other by a different force, the nuclear force, which is
usually stronger than the electromagnetic force repelling the positively
charged protons from one another. Under certain circumstances the repelling
electromagnetic force becomes stronger than the nuclear force, and nucleons
can be ejected from the nucleus, leaving behind a different element:
nuclear decay resulting in nuclear transmutation.

The number of protons in the nucleus defines to what chemical element the
atom belongs: for example, all copper atoms contain 29 protons. The number
of neutrons defines the isotope of the element.³ The number of electrons
influences the magnetic properties of an atom. Atoms can attach to one or
more other atoms by chemical bonds to form chemical compounds such as
molecules. The ability of atoms to associate and dissociate is responsible
for most of the physical changes observed in nature, and is the subject of
the discipline of chemistry.

Not all the matter of the universe is composed of atoms. Dark matter
comprises more of the Universe than matter, and is composed not of atoms,
but of particles of a currently unknown type.

History of atomic theory

Main article: Atomic theory

Atoms in philosophy

Main article: Atomism

The idea that matter is made up of discrete units is a very old one,
appearing in many ancient cultures such as Greece and India. The word
"atom", in fact, was coined by ancient Greek philosophers. However, these
ideas were founded in philosophical and theological reasoning rather than
evidence and experimentation. As a result, their views on what atoms look
like and how they behave were incorrect. They also could not convince
everybody, so atomism was but one of a number of competing theories on the
nature of matter. It was not until the 19th century that the idea was
embraced and refined by scientists, when the blossoming science of
chemistry produced discoveries that only the concept of atoms could
explain.

First evidence-based theory

In the early 1800s, John Dalton used the concept of atoms to explain why
elements always react in ratios of small whole numbers (the law of multiple
proportions). For instance, there are two types of tin oxide: one is 88.1%
tin and 11.9% oxygen and the other is 78.7% tin and 21.3% oxygen (tin(II)
oxide and tin dioxide respectively). This means that 100g of tin will
combine either with 13.5g or 27g of oxygen. 13.5 and 27 form a ratio of
1:2, a ratio of small whole numbers. This common pattern in chemistry
suggested to Dalton that elements react in whole number multiples of
discrete units—in other words, atoms. In the case of tin oxides, one tin
atom will combine with either one or two oxygen atoms.⁴

Dalton also believed atomic theory could explain why water absorbs
different gases in different proportions. For example, he found that water
absorbs carbon dioxide far better than it absorbs nitrogen.⁵ Dalton
hypothesized this was due to the differences in mass and complexity of the
gases' respective particles. Indeed, carbon dioxide molecules (CO₂) are
heavier and larger than nitrogen molecules (N₂).

Brownian motion

In 1827, botanist Robert Brown used a microscope to look at dust grains
floating in water and discovered that they moved about erratically, a
phenomenon that became known as "Brownian motion". This was thought to be
caused by water molecules knocking the grains about. In 1905 Albert
Einstein produced the first mathematical analysis of the motion.⁶ ⁷ ⁸
French physicist Jean Perrin used Einstein's work to experimentally
determine the mass and dimensions of atoms, thereby conclusively verifying
Dalton's atomic theory.⁹

Discovery of the electron

The physicist J. J. Thomson measured the mass of cathode rays, showing they
were made of particles, but were around 1800 times lighter than the
lightest atom, hydrogen. Therefore, they were not atoms, but a new
particle, the first subatomic particle to be discovered, which he
originally called "corpuscle" but was later named electron, after particles
postulated by George Johnstone Stoney in 1874. He also showed they were
identical to particles given off by photoelectric and radioactive
materials.¹⁰ It was quickly recognized that they are the particles that
carry electric currents in metal wires, and carry the negative electric
charge within atoms. Thomson was given the 1906 Nobel Prize in Physics for
this work. Thus he overturned the belief that atoms are the indivisible,
ultimate particles of matter.¹¹ Thomson also incorrectly postulated that
the low mass, negatively charged electrons were distributed throughout the
atom in a uniform sea of positive charge. This became known as the plum
pudding model.

Discovery of the nucleus

Main article: Geiger-Marsden experiment

In 1909, Hans Geiger and Ernest Marsden, under the direction of Ernest
Rutherford, bombarded a metal foil with alpha particles to observe how they
scattered. They expected all the alpha particles to pass straight through
with little deflection, because Thomson's model said that the charges in
the atom are so diffuse that their electric fields could not affect the
alpha particles much. However, Geiger and Marsden spotted alpha particles
being deflected by angles greater than 90°, which was supposed to be
impossible according to Thomson's model. To explain this, Rutherford
proposed that the positive charge of the atom is concentrated in a tiny
nucleus at the center of the atom.¹²

Discovery of isotopes

While experimenting with the products of radioactive decay, in 1913
radiochemist Frederick Soddy discovered that there appeared to be more than
one type of atom at each position on the periodic table.¹³ The term isotope
was coined by Margaret Todd as a suitable name for different atoms that
belong to the same element. J.J. Thomson created a technique for separating
atom types through his work on ionized gases, which subsequently led to the
discovery of stable isotopes.¹⁴

Bohr model

Main article: Bohr model

In 1913 the physicist Niels Bohr proposed a model in which the electrons of
an atom were assumed to orbit the nucleus but could only do so in a finite
set of orbits, and could jump between these orbits only in discrete changes
of energy corresponding to absorption or radiation of a photon.¹⁵ This
quantization was used to explain why the electrons orbits are stable (given
that normally, charges in acceleration, including circular motion, lose
kinetic energy which is emitted as electromagnetic radiation, see
synchrotron radiation) and why elements absorb and emit electromagnetic
radiation in discrete spectra.¹⁶

Later in the same year Henry Moseley provided additional experimental
evidence in favor of Niels Bohr's theory. These results refined Ernest
Rutherford's and Antonius Van den Broek's model, which proposed that the
atom contains in its nucleus a number of positive nuclear charges that is
equal to its (atomic) number in the periodic table. Until these
experiments, atomic number was not known to be a physical and experimental
quantity. That it is equal to the atomic nuclear charge remains the
accepted atomic model today.¹⁷

Chemical bonding explained

Chemical bonds between atoms were now explained, by Gilbert Newton Lewis in
1916, as the interactions between their constituent electrons.¹⁸ As the
chemical properties of the elements were known to largely repeat themselves
according to the periodic law,¹⁹ in 1919 the American chemist Irving
Langmuir suggested that this could be explained if the electrons in an atom
were connected or clustered in some manner. Groups of electrons were
thought to occupy a set of electron shells about the nucleus.²⁰

Further developments in quantum physics

The Stern–Gerlach experiment of 1922 provided further evidence of the
quantum nature of the atom. When a beam of silver atoms was passed through
a specially shaped magnetic field, the beam was split based on the
direction of an atom's angular momentum, or spin. As this direction is
random, the beam could be expected to spread into a line. Instead, the beam
was split into two parts, depending on whether the atomic spin was oriented
up or down.²¹

In 1924, Louis de Broglie proposed that all particles behave to an extent
like waves. In 1926, Erwin Schrödinger used this idea to develop a
mathematical model of the atom that described the electrons as
three-dimensional waveforms rather than point particles. A consequence of
using waveforms to describe particles is that it is mathematically
impossible to obtain precise values for both the position and momentum of a
particle at the same time; this became known as the uncertainty principle,
formulated by Werner Heisenberg in 1926. In this concept, for a given
accuracy in measuring a position one could only obtain a range of probable
values for momentum, and vice versa. This model was able to explain
observations of atomic behavior that previous models could not, such as
certain structural and spectral patterns of atoms larger than hydrogen.
Thus, the planetary model of the atom was discarded in favor of one that
described atomic orbital zones around the nucleus where a given electron is
most likely to be observed.²² ²³

Discovery of the neutron

The development of the mass spectrometer allowed the mass of atoms to be
measured with increased accuracy. The device uses a magnet to bend the
trajectory of a beam of ions, and the amount of deflection is determined by
the ratio of an atom's mass to its charge. The chemist Francis William
Aston used this instrument to show that isotopes had different masses. The
atomic mass of these isotopes varied by integer amounts, called the whole
number rule.²⁴ The explanation for these different isotopes awaited the
discovery of the neutron, an uncharged particle with a mass similar to the
proton, by the physicist James Chadwick in 1932. Isotopes were then
explained as elements with the same number of protons, but different
numbers of neutrons within the nucleus.²⁵

Fission, high-energy physics and condensed matter

In 1938, the German chemist Otto Hahn, a student of Rutherford, directed
neutrons onto uranium atoms expecting to get transuranium elements.
Instead, his chemical experiments showed barium as a product.²⁶ A year
later, Lise Meitner and her nephew Otto Frisch verified that Hahn's result
were the first experimental nuclear fission.²⁷ ²⁸ In 1944, Hahn received
the Nobel prize in chemistry. Despite Hahn's efforts, the contributions of
Meitner and Frisch were not recognized.²⁹

In the 1950s, the development of improved particle accelerators and
particle detectors allowed scientists to study the impacts of atoms moving
at high energies.³⁰ Neutrons and protons were found to be hadrons, or
composites of smaller particles called quarks. The standard model of
particle physics was developed that so far has successfully explained the
properties of the nucleus in terms of these sub-atomic particles and the
forces that govern their interactions.³¹

Structure

Subatomic particles

Main article: Subatomic particle

Though the word atom originally denoted a particle that cannot be cut into
smaller particles, in modern scientific usage the atom is composed of
various subatomic particles. The constituent particles of an atom are the
electron, the proton and the neutron; all three are fermions. However, the
hydrogen-1 atom has no neutrons and the hydron ion has no electrons.

The electron is by far the least massive of these particles at 9.11×10−31
kg, with a negative electrical charge and a size that is too small to be
measured using available techniques.³² It is the lightest particle with a
positive rest mass measured. Under ordinary conditions, electrons are bound
to the positively charged nucleus by the attraction created from opposite
electric charges. If an atom has more or fewer electrons than its atomic
number, then it becomes respectively negatively or positively charged as a
whole; a charged atom is called an ion. Electrons have been known since the
late 19th century, mostly thanks to J.J. Thomson; see history of subatomic
physics for details.

Protons have a positive charge and a mass 1,836 times that of the electron,
at 1.6726×10−27 kg. The number of protons in an atom is called its atomic
number. Ernest Rutherford (1919) observed that nitrogen under
alpha-particle bombardment ejects what appeared to be hydrogen nuclei. By
1920 he had accepted that the hydrogen nucleus is a distinct particle
within the atom and named it proton.

Neutrons have no electrical charge and have a free mass of 1,839 times the
mass of the electron,³³ or 1.6929×10−27 kg, the heaviest of the three
constituent particles, but it can be reduced by the nuclear binding energy.
Neutrons and protons (collectively known as nucleons) have comparable
dimensions—on the order of 2.5×10−15 m—although the 'surface' of these
particles is not sharply defined.³⁴ The neutron was discovered in 1932 by
the English physicist James Chadwick.

In the Standard Model of physics, electrons are truly elementary particles
with no internal structure. However, both protons and neutrons are
composite particles composed of elementary particles called quarks. There
are two types of quarks in atoms, each having a fractional electric charge.
Protons are composed of two up quarks (each with charge +²⁄₃) and one down
quark (with a charge of −¹⁄₃). Neutrons consist of one up quark and two
down quarks. This distinction accounts for the difference in mass and
charge between the two particles.³⁵ ³⁶

The quarks are held together by the strong interaction (or strong force),
which is mediated by gluons. The protons and neutrons, in turn, are held to
each other in the nucleus by the nuclear force, which is a residuum of the
strong force that has somewhat different range-properties (see the article
on the nuclear force for more). The gluon is a member of the family of
gauge bosons, which are elementary particles that mediate physical
forces.³⁵ ³⁶

Nucleus

Main article: Atomic nucleus

All the bound protons and neutrons in an atom make up a tiny atomic
nucleus, and are collectively called nucleons. The radius of a nucleus is
approximately equal to 1.07 ³√A fm, where A is the total number of
nucleons.³⁷ This is much smaller than the radius of the atom, which is on
the order of 10⁵ fm. The nucleons are bound together by a short-ranged
attractive potential called the residual strong force. At distances smaller
than 2.5 fm this force is much more powerful than the electrostatic force
that causes positively charged protons to repel each other.³⁸

Atoms of the same element have the same number of protons, called the
atomic number. Within a single element, the number of neutrons may vary,
determining the isotope of that element. The total number of protons and
neutrons determine the nuclide. The number of neutrons relative to the
protons determines the stability of the nucleus, with certain isotopes
undergoing radioactive decay.³⁹

The proton, the electron, and the neutron are classified as fermions.
Fermions obey the Pauli exclusion principle which prohibits identical
fermions, such as multiple protons, from occupying the same quantum state
at the same time. Thus, every proton in the nucleus must occupy a quantum
state different from all other protons, and the same applies to all
neutrons of the nucleus and to all electrons of the electron cloud.
However, a proton and a neutron are allowed to occupy the same quantum
state.⁴⁰

For atoms with low atomic numbers, a nucleus that has more neutrons than
protons tends to drop to a lower energy state through radioactive decay so
that the neutron–proton ratio is closer to one. However, as the atomic
number increases, a higher proportion of neutrons is required to offset the
mutual repulsion of the protons. Thus, there are no stable nuclei with
equal proton and neutron numbers above atomic number Z = 20 (calcium) and
as Z increases, the neutron–proton ratio of stable isotopes increases.⁴⁰
The stable isotope with the highest proton–neutron ratio is lead-208 (about
1.5).

The number of protons and neutrons in the atomic nucleus can be modified,
although this can require very high energies because of the strong force.
Nuclear fusion occurs when multiple atomic particles join to form a heavier
nucleus, such as through the energetic collision of two nuclei. For
example, at the core of the Sun protons require energies of 3–10 keV to
overcome their mutual repulsion—the coulomb barrier—and fuse together into
a single nucleus.⁴¹ Nuclear fission is the opposite process, causing a
nucleus to split into two smaller nuclei—usually through radioactive decay.
The nucleus can also be modified through bombardment by high energy
subatomic particles or photons. If this modifies the number of protons in a
nucleus, the atom changes to a different chemical element.⁴² ⁴³

If the mass of the nucleus following a fusion reaction is less than the sum
of the masses of the separate particles, then the difference between these
two values can be emitted as a type of usable energy (such as a gamma ray,
or the kinetic energy of a beta particle), as described by Albert
Einstein's mass–energy equivalence formula, E = mc², where m is the mass
loss and c is the speed of light. This deficit is part of the binding
energy of the new nucleus, and it is the non-recoverable loss of the energy
that causes the fused particles to remain together in a state that requires
this energy to separate.⁴⁴

The fusion of two nuclei that create larger nuclei with lower atomic
numbers than iron and nickel—a total nucleon number of about 60—is usually
an exothermic process that releases more energy than is required to bring
them together.⁴⁵ It is this energy-releasing process that makes nuclear
fusion in stars a self-sustaining reaction. For heavier nuclei, the binding
energy per nucleon in the nucleus begins to decrease. That means fusion
processes producing nuclei that have atomic numbers higher than about 26,
and atomic masses higher than about 60, is an endothermic process. These
more massive nuclei can not undergo an energy-producing fusion reaction
that can sustain the hydrostatic equilibrium of a star.⁴⁰

Electron cloud

Main articles: Atomic orbital and Electron configuration

The electrons in an atom are attracted to the protons in the nucleus by the
electromagnetic force. This force binds the electrons inside an
electrostatic potential well surrounding the smaller nucleus, which means
that an external source of energy is needed for the electron to escape. The
closer an electron is to the nucleus, the greater the attractive force.
Hence electrons bound near the center of the potential well require more
energy to escape than those at greater separations.

Electrons, like other particles, have properties of both a particle and a
wave. The electron cloud is a region inside the potential well where each
electron forms a type of three-dimensional standing wave—a wave form that
does not move relative to the nucleus. This behavior is defined by an
atomic orbital, a mathematical function that characterises the probability
that an electron appears to be at a particular location when its position
is measured.⁴⁶ Only a discrete (or quantized) set of these orbitals exist
around the nucleus, as other possible wave patterns rapidly decay into a
more stable form.⁴⁷ Orbitals can have one or more ring or node structures,
and they differ from each other in size, shape and orientation.⁴⁸

Each atomic orbital corresponds to a particular energy level of the
electron. The electron can change its state to a higher energy level by
absorbing a photon with sufficient energy to boost it into the new quantum
state. Likewise, through spontaneous emission, an electron in a higher
energy state can drop to a lower energy state while radiating the excess
energy as a photon. These characteristic energy values, defined by the
differences in the energies of the quantum states, are responsible for
atomic spectral lines.⁴⁷

The amount of energy needed to remove or add an electron—the electron
binding energy—is far less than the binding energy of nucleons. For
example, it requires only 13.6 eV to strip a ground-state electron from a
hydrogen atom,⁴⁹ compared to 2.23 million eV for splitting a deuterium
nucleus.⁵⁰ Atoms are electrically neutral if they have an equal number of
protons and electrons. Atoms that have either a deficit or a surplus of
electrons are called ions. Electrons that are farthest from the nucleus may
be transferred to other nearby atoms or shared between atoms. By this
mechanism, atoms are able to bond into molecules and other types of
chemical compounds like ionic and covalent network crystals.⁵¹

Properties

Nuclear properties

Main articles: Isotope, Stable isotope, List of nuclides and List of
elements by stability of isotopes

By definition, any two atoms with an identical number of protons in their
nuclei belong to the same chemical element. Atoms with equal numbers of
protons but a different number of neutrons are different isotopes of the
same element. For example, all hydrogen atoms admit exactly one proton, but
isotopes exist with no neutrons (hydrogen-1, by far the most common form,⁵²
also called protium), one neutron (deuterium), two neutrons (tritium) and
more than two neutrons. The known elements form a set of atomic numbers,
from the single proton element hydrogen up to the 118-proton element
ununoctium.⁵³ All known isotopes of elements with atomic numbers greater
than 82 are radioactive.⁵⁴ ⁵⁵

About 339 nuclides occur naturally on Earth,⁵⁶ of which 254 (about 75%)
have not been observed to decay, and are referred to as "stable isotopes".
However, only 90 of these nuclides are stable to all decay, even in theory.
Another 164 (bringing the total to 254) have not been observed to decay,
even though in theory it is energetically possible. These are also formally
classified as "stable". An additional 34 radioactive nuclides have
half-lives longer than 80 million years, and are long-lived enough to be
present from the birth of the solar system. This collection of 288 nuclides
are known as primordial nuclides. Finally, an additional 51 short-lived
nuclides are known to occur naturally, as daughter products of primordial
nuclide decay (such as radium from uranium), or else as products of natural
energetic processes on Earth, such as cosmic ray bombardment (for example,
carbon-14).⁵⁷ [note 1]

For 80 of the chemical elements, at least one stable isotope exists. As a
rule, there is only a handful of stable isotopes for each of these
elements, the average being 3.2 stable isotopes per element. Twenty-six
elements have only a single stable isotope, while the largest number of
stable isotopes observed for any element is ten, for the element tin.
Elements 43, 61, and all elements numbered 83 or higher have no stable
isotopes.⁵⁸

Stability of isotopes is affected by the ratio of protons to neutrons, and
also by the presence of certain "magic numbers" of neutrons or protons that
represent closed and filled quantum shells. These quantum shells correspond
to a set of energy levels within the shell model of the nucleus; filled
shells, such as the filled shell of 50 protons for tin, confers unusual
stability on the nuclide. Of the 254 known stable nuclides, only four have
both an odd number of protons and odd number of neutrons: hydrogen-2
(deuterium), lithium-6, boron-10 and nitrogen-14. Also, only four naturally
occurring, radioactive odd–odd nuclides have a half-life over a billion
years: potassium-40, vanadium-50, lanthanum-138 and tantalum-180m. Most
odd–odd nuclei are highly unstable with respect to beta decay, because the
decay products are even–even, and are therefore more strongly bound, due to
nuclear pairing effects.⁵⁸

Mass

Main articles: Atomic mass and mass number

The large majority of an atom's mass comes from the protons and neutrons
that make it up. The total number of these particles (called "nucleons") in
a given atom is called the mass number. It is a positive integer and
dimensionless (instead of having dimension of mass), because it expresses a
count. An example of use of a mass number is "carbon-12," which has 12
nucleons (six protons and six neutrons).

The actual mass of an atom at rest is often expressed using the unified
atomic mass unit (u), also called dalton (Da). This unit is defined as a
twelfth of the mass of a free neutral atom of carbon-12, which is
approximately 1.66×10−27 kg.⁵⁹ Hydrogen-1 (the lightest isotope of hydrogen
which is also the nuclide with the lowest mass) has an atomic weight of
1.007825 u.⁶⁰ The value of this number is called the atomic mass. A given
atom has an atomic mass approximately equal (within 1%) to its mass number
times the atomic mass unit (for example the mass of a nitrogen-14 is
roughly 14 u). However, this number will not be exactly an integer except
in the case of carbon-12 (see below).⁶¹ The heaviest stable atom is
lead-208,⁵⁴ with a mass of 207.9766521 u.⁶²

As even the most massive atoms are far too light to work with directly,
chemists instead use the unit of moles. One mole of atoms of any element
always has the same number of atoms (about 6.022×10²³). This number was
chosen so that if an element has an atomic mass of 1 u, a mole of atoms of
that element has a mass close to one gram. Because of the definition of the
unified atomic mass unit, each carbon-12 atom has an atomic mass of exactly
12 u, and so a mole of carbon-12 atoms weighs exactly 0.012 kg.⁵⁹

Shape and size

Main article: Atomic radius

Atoms lack a well-defined outer boundary, so their dimensions are usually
described in terms of an atomic radius. This is a measure of the distance
out to which the electron cloud extends from the nucleus.² However, this
assumes the atom to exhibit a spherical shape, which is only obeyed for
atoms in vacuum or free space. Atomic radii may be derived from the
distances between two nuclei when the two atoms are joined in a chemical
bond. The radius varies with the location of an atom on the atomic chart,
the type of chemical bond, the number of neighboring atoms (coordination
number) and a quantum mechanical property known as spin.⁶³ On the periodic
table of the elements, atom size tends to increase when moving down
columns, but decrease when moving across rows (left to right).⁶⁴
Consequently, the smallest atom is helium with a radius of 32 pm, while one
of the largest is caesium at 225 pm.⁶⁵

When subjected to external forces, like electrical fields, the shape of an
atom may deviate from spherical symmetry. The deformation depends on the
field magnitude and the orbital type of outer shell electrons, as shown by
group-theoretical considerations. Aspherical deviations might be elicited
for instance in crystals, where large crystal-electrical fields may occur
at low-symmetry lattice sites. Significant ellipsoidal deformations have
recently been shown to occur for sulfur ions⁶⁶ and chalcogen ions⁶⁷ in
pyrite-type compounds.

Atomic dimensions are thousands of times smaller than the wavelengths of
light (400–700 nm) so they cannot be viewed using an optical microscope.
However, individual atoms can be observed using a scanning tunneling
microscope. To visualize the minuteness of the atom, consider that a
typical human hair is about 1 million carbon atoms in width.⁶⁸ A single
drop of water contains about 2 sextillion (2×10²¹) atoms of oxygen, and
twice the number of hydrogen atoms.⁶⁹ A single carat diamond with a mass of
2×10−4 kg contains about 10 sextillion (10²²) atoms of carbon.[note 2] If
an apple were magnified to the size of the Earth, then the atoms in the
apple would be approximately the size of the original apple.⁷⁰

Radioactive decay

Main article: Radioactive decay

Every element has one or more isotopes that have unstable nuclei that are
subject to radioactive decay, causing the nucleus to emit particles or
electromagnetic radiation. Radioactivity can occur when the radius of a
nucleus is large compared with the radius of the strong force, which only
acts over distances on the order of 1 fm.⁷¹

The most common forms of radioactive decay are:⁷² ⁷³

- Alpha decay: this process is caused when the nucleus emits an alpha
  particle, which is a helium nucleus consisting of two protons and two
  neutrons. The result of the emission is a new element with a lower atomic
  number.
- Beta decay (and electron capture): these processes are regulated by the
  weak force, and result from a transformation of a neutron into a proton,
  or a proton into a neutron. The neutron to proton transition is
  accompanied by the emission of an electron and an antineutrino, while
  proton to neutron transition (except in electron capture) causes the
  emission of a positron and a neutrino. The electron or positron emissions
  are called beta particles. Beta decay either increases or decreases the
  atomic number of the nucleus by one. Electron capture is more common than
  positron emission, because it requires less energy. In this type of
  decay, an electron is absorbed by the nucleus, rather than a positron
  emitted from the nucleus. A neutrino is still emitted in this process,
  and a proton changes to a neutron.
- Gamma decay: this process results from a change in the energy level of
  the nucleus to a lower state, resulting in the emission of
  electromagnetic radiation. The excited state of a nucleus which results
  in gamma emission usually occurs following the emission of an alpha or a
  beta particle. Thus, gamma decay usually follows alpha or beta decay.

Other more rare types of radioactive decay include ejection of neutrons or
protons or clusters of nucleons from a nucleus, or more than one beta
particle. An analog of gamma emission which allows excited nuclei to lose
energy in a different way, is internal conversion— a process that produces
high-speed electrons that are not beta rays, followed by production of
high-energy photons that are not gamma rays. A few large nuclei explode
into two or more charged fragments of varying masses plus several neutrons,
in a decay called spontaneous nuclear fission.

Each radioactive isotope has a characteristic decay time period—the
half-life—that is determined by the amount of time needed for half of a
sample to decay. This is an exponential decay process that steadily
decreases the proportion of the remaining isotope by 50% every half-life.
Hence after two half-lives have passed only 25% of the isotope is present,
and so forth.⁷¹

Magnetic moment

Main articles: Electron magnetic moment and Nuclear magnetic moment

Elementary particles possess an intrinsic quantum mechanical property known
as spin. This is analogous to the angular momentum of an object that is
spinning around its center of mass, although strictly speaking these
particles are believed to be point-like and cannot be said to be rotating.
Spin is measured in units of the reduced Planck constant (ħ), with
electrons, protons and neutrons all having spin ½ ħ, or "spin-½". In an
atom, electrons in motion around the nucleus possess orbital angular
momentum in addition to their spin, while the nucleus itself possesses
angular momentum due to its nuclear spin.⁷⁴

The magnetic field produced by an atom—its magnetic moment—is determined by
these various forms of angular momentum, just as a rotating charged object
classically produces a magnetic field. However, the most dominant
contribution comes from electron spin. Due to the nature of electrons to
obey the Pauli exclusion principle, in which no two electrons may be found
in the same quantum state, bound electrons pair up with each other, with
one member of each pair in a spin up state and the other in the opposite,
spin down state. Thus these spins cancel each other out, reducing the total
magnetic dipole moment to zero in some atoms with even number of
electrons.⁷⁵

In ferromagnetic elements such as iron, cobalt and nickel, an odd number of
electrons leads to an unpaired electron and a net overall magnetic moment.
The orbitals of neighboring atoms overlap and a lower energy state is
achieved when the spins of unpaired electrons are aligned with each other,
a spontaneous process known as an exchange interaction. When the magnetic
moments of ferromagnetic atoms are lined up, the material can produce a
measurable macroscopic field. Paramagnetic materials have atoms with
magnetic moments that line up in random directions when no magnetic field
is present, but the magnetic moments of the individual atoms line up in the
presence of a field.⁷⁵ ⁷⁶

The nucleus of an atom will have no spin when it has even numbers of both
neutrons and protons, but for other cases of odd numbers, the nucleus may
have a spin. Normally nuclei with spin are aligned in random directions
because of thermal equilibrium. However, for certain elements (such as
xenon-129) it is possible to polarize a significant proportion of the
nuclear spin states so that they are aligned in the same direction—a
condition called hyperpolarization. This has important applications in
magnetic resonance imaging.⁷⁷ ⁷⁸

Energy levels

The potential energy of an electron in an atom is negative, its dependence
of its position reaches the minimum (the most absolute value) inside the
nucleus, and vanishes when the distance from the nucleus goes to infinity,
roughly in an inverse proportion to the distance. In the quantum-mechanical
model, a bound electron can only occupy a set of states centered on the
nucleus, and each state corresponds to a specific energy level; see
time-independent Schrödinger equation for theoretical explanation. An
energy level can be measured by the amount of energy needed to unbind the
electron from the atom, and is usually given in units of electronvolts
(eV). The lowest energy state of a bound electron is called the ground
state, i.e. stationary state, while an electron transition to a higher
level results in an excited state.⁷⁹ The electron's energy raises when n
increases because the (average) distance to the nucleus increases.
Dependence of the energy on ℓ is caused not by electrostatic potential of
the nucleus, but by interaction between electrons.

For an electron to transition between two different states, e.g. grounded
state to first excited level (ionization), it must absorb or emit a photon
at an energy matching the difference in the potential energy of those
levels, according to Niels Bohr model, what can be precisely calculated by
the Schrödinger equation. Electrons jump between orbitals in a
particle-like fashion. For example, if a single photon strikes the
electrons, only a single electron changes states in response to the photon;
see Electron properties.

The energy of an emitted photon is proportional to its frequency, so these
specific energy levels appear as distinct bands in the electromagnetic
spectrum.⁸⁰ Each element has a characteristic spectrum that can depend on
the nuclear charge, subshells filled by electrons, the electromagnetic
interactions between the electrons and other factors.⁸¹

When a continuous spectrum of energy is passed through a gas or plasma,
some of the photons are absorbed by atoms, causing electrons to change
their energy level. Those excited electrons that remain bound to their atom
spontaneously emit this energy as a photon, traveling in a random
direction, and so drop back to lower energy levels. Thus the atoms behave
like a filter that forms a series of dark absorption bands in the energy
output. (An observer viewing the atoms from a view that does not include
the continuous spectrum in the background, instead sees a series of
emission lines from the photons emitted by the atoms.) Spectroscopic
measurements of the strength and width of atomic spectral lines allow the
composition and physical properties of a substance to be determined.⁸²

Close examination of the spectral lines reveals that some display a fine
structure splitting. This occurs because of spin–orbit coupling, which is
an interaction between the spin and motion of the outermost electron.⁸³
When an atom is in an external magnetic field, spectral lines become split
into three or more components; a phenomenon called the Zeeman effect. This
is caused by the interaction of the magnetic field with the magnetic moment
of the atom and its electrons. Some atoms can have multiple electron
configurations with the same energy level, which thus appear as a single
spectral line. The interaction of the magnetic field with the atom shifts
these electron configurations to slightly different energy levels,
resulting in multiple spectral lines.⁸⁴ The presence of an external
electric field can cause a comparable splitting and shifting of spectral
lines by modifying the electron energy levels, a phenomenon called the
Stark effect.⁸⁵

If a bound electron is in an excited state, an interacting photon with the
proper energy can cause stimulated emission of a photon with a matching
energy level. For this to occur, the electron must drop to a lower energy
state that has an energy difference matching the energy of the interacting
photon. The emitted photon and the interacting photon then move off in
parallel and with matching phases. That is, the wave patterns of the two
photons are synchronized. This physical property is used to make lasers,
which can emit a coherent beam of light energy in a narrow frequency
band.⁸⁶

Valence and bonding behavior

Main articles: Valence (chemistry) and Chemical bond

Valency is the combining power of an element. It is equal to number of
hydrogen atoms that atom can combine or displace in forming compounds.⁸⁷
The outermost electron shell of an atom in its uncombined state is known as
the valence shell, and the electrons in that shell are called valence
electrons. The number of valence electrons determines the bondingbehavior
with other atoms. Atoms tend to chemically react with each other in a
manner that fills (or empties) their outer valence shells.⁸⁸ For example, a
transfer of a single electron between atoms is a useful approximation for
bonds that form between atoms with one-electron more than a filled shell,
and others that are one-electron short of a full shell, such as occurs in
the compound sodium chloride and other chemical ionic salts. However, many
elements display multiple valences, or tendencies to share differing
numbers of electrons in different compounds. Thus, chemical bonding between
these elements takes many forms of electron-sharing that are more than
simple electron transfers. Examples include the element carbon and the
organic compounds.⁸⁹

The chemical elements are often displayed in a periodic table that is laid
out to display recurring chemical properties, and elements with the same
number of valence electrons form a group that is aligned in the same column
of the table. (The horizontal rows correspond to the filling of a quantum
shell of electrons.) The elements at the far right of the table have their
outer shell completely filled with electrons, which results in chemically
inert elements known as the noble gases.⁹⁰ ⁹¹

States

Main articles: State of matter and Phase (matter)

Quantities of atoms are found in different states of matter that depend on
the physical conditions, such as temperature and pressure. By varying the
conditions, materials can transition between solids, liquids, gases and
plasmas.⁹² Within a state, a material can also exist in different
allotropes. An example of this is solid carbon, which can exist as graphite
or diamond.⁹³ Gaseous allotropes exist as well, such as dioxygen and ozone.

At temperatures close to absolute zero, atoms can form a Bose–Einstein
condensate, at which point quantum mechanical effects, which are normally
only observed at the atomic scale, become apparent on a macroscopic
scale.⁹⁴ ⁹⁵ This super-cooled collection of atoms then behaves as a single
super atom, which may allow fundamental checks of quantum mechanical
behavior.⁹⁶

Identification

The scanning tunneling microscope is a device for viewing surfaces at the
atomic level. It uses the quantum tunneling phenomenon, which allows
particles to pass through a barrier that would normally be insurmountable.
Electrons tunnel through the vacuum between two planar metal electrodes, on
each of which is an adsorbed atom, providing a tunneling-current density
that can be measured. Scanning one atom (taken as the tip) as it moves past
the other (the sample) permits plotting of tip displacement versus lateral
separation for a constant current. The calculation shows the extent to
which scanning-tunneling-microscope images of an individual atom are
visible. It confirms that for low bias, the microscope images the
space-averaged dimensions of the electron orbitals across closely packed
energy levels—the Fermi level local density of states.⁹⁷ ⁹⁸

An atom can be ionized by removing one of its electrons. The electric
charge causes the trajectory of an atom to bend when it passes through a
magnetic field. The radius by which the trajectory of a moving ion is
turned by the magnetic field is determined by the mass of the atom. The
mass spectrometer uses this principle to measure the mass-to-charge ratio
of ions. If a sample contains multiple isotopes, the mass spectrometer can
determine the proportion of each isotope in the sample by measuring the
intensity of the different beams of ions. Techniques to vaporize atoms
include inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy and
inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, both of which use a plasma to
vaporize samples for analysis.⁹⁹

A more area-selective method is electron energy loss spectroscopy, which
measures the energy loss of an electron beam within a transmission electron
microscope when it interacts with a portion of a sample. The atom-probe
tomograph has sub-nanometer resolution in 3-D and can chemically identify
individual atoms using time-of-flight mass spectrometry.¹⁰⁰

Spectra of excited states can be used to analyze the atomic composition of
distant stars. Specific light wavelengths contained in the observed light
from stars can be separated out and related to the quantized transitions in
free gas atoms. These colors can be replicated using a gas-discharge lamp
containing the same element.¹⁰¹ Helium was discovered in this way in the
spectrum of the Sun 23 years before it was found on Earth.¹⁰²

Origin and current state

Atoms form about 4% of the total energy density of the observable Universe,
with an average density of about 0.25 atoms/m³.¹⁰³ Within a galaxy such as
the Milky Way, atoms have a much higher concentration, with the density of
matter in the interstellar medium (ISM) ranging from 10⁵ to 10⁹
atoms/m³.¹⁰⁴ The Sun is believed to be inside the Local Bubble, a region of
highly ionized gas, so the density in the solar neighborhood is only about
10³ atoms/m³.¹⁰⁵ Stars form from dense clouds in the ISM, and the
evolutionary processes of stars result in the steady enrichment of the ISM
with elements more massive than hydrogen and helium. Up to 95% of the Milky
Way's atoms are concentrated inside stars and the total mass of atoms forms
about 10% of the mass of the galaxy.¹⁰⁶ (The remainder of the mass is an
unknown dark matter.)¹⁰⁷

Formation

Electrons are thought to exist in the Universe since early stages of the
Big Bang. Atomic nuclei forms in nucleosynthesis reactions. In about three
minutes Big Bang nucleosynthesis produced most of the helium, lithium, and
deuterium in the Universe, and perhaps some of the beryllium and boron.¹⁰⁸
¹⁰⁹ ¹¹⁰

Ubiquitousness and stability of atoms relies on their binding energy, which
means that an atom has a lower energy than an unbound system of the nucleus
and electrons. Where the temperature is much higher than ionization
potential, the matter exists in the form of plasma—a gas of positively
charged ions (possibly, bare nuclei) and electrons. When the temperature
drops below the ionization potential, atoms become statistically favorable.
Atoms (complete with bound electrons) became to dominate over charged
particles 380,000 years after the Big Bang—an epoch called recombination,
when the expanding Universe cooled enough to allow electrons to become
attached to nuclei.¹¹¹

Since the Big Bang, which produced no carbon or heavier elements, atomic
nuclei have been combined in stars through the process of nuclear fusion to
produce more of the element helium, and (via the triple alpha process) the
sequence of elements from carbon up to iron;¹¹² see stellar nucleosynthesis
for details.

Isotopes such as lithium-6, as well as some beryllium and boron are
generated in space through cosmic ray spallation.¹¹³ This occurs when a
high-energy proton strikes an atomic nucleus, causing large numbers of
nucleons to be ejected.

Elements heavier than iron were produced in supernovae through the
r-process and in AGB stars through the s-process, both of which involve the
capture of neutrons by atomic nuclei.¹¹⁴ Elements such as lead formed
largely through the radioactive decay of heavier elements.¹¹⁵

Earth

Most of the atoms that make up the Earth and its inhabitants were present
in their current form in the nebula that collapsed out of a molecular cloud
to form the Solar System. The rest are the result of radioactive decay, and
their relative proportion can be used to determine the age of the Earth
through radiometric dating.¹¹⁶ ¹¹⁷ Most of the helium in the crust of the
Earth (about 99% of the helium from gas wells, as shown by its lower
abundance of helium-3) is a product of alpha decay.¹¹⁸

There are a few trace atoms on Earth that were not present at the beginning
(i.e., not "primordial"), nor are results of radioactive decay. Carbon-14
is continuously generated by cosmic rays in the atmosphere.¹¹⁹ Some atoms
on Earth have been artificially generated either deliberately or as
by-products of nuclear reactors or explosions.¹²⁰ ¹²¹ Of the transuranic
elements—those with atomic numbers greater than 92—only plutonium and
neptunium occur naturally on Earth.¹²² ¹²³ Transuranic elements have
radioactive lifetimes shorter than the current age of the Earth¹²⁴ and thus
identifiable quantities of these elements have long since decayed, with the
exception of traces of plutonium-244 possibly deposited by cosmic dust.¹²⁵
Natural deposits of plutonium and neptunium are produced by neutron capture
in uranium ore.¹²⁶

The Earth contains approximately 1.33×10⁵⁰ atoms.¹²⁷ Although small numbers
of independent atoms of noble gases exist, such as argon, neon, and helium,
99% of the atmosphere is bound in the form of molecules, including carbon
dioxide and diatomic oxygen and nitrogen. At the surface of the Earth, an
overwhelming majority of atoms combine to form various compounds, including
water, salt, silicates and oxides. Atoms can also combine to create
materials that do not consist of discrete molecules, including crystals and
liquid or solid metals.¹²⁸ ¹²⁹ This atomic matter forms networked
arrangements that lack the particular type of small-scale interrupted order
associated with molecular matter.¹³⁰

Rare and theoretical forms

Superheavy elements

Main article: Transuranium element

While isotopes with atomic numbers higher than lead (82) are known to be
radioactive, an "island of stability" has been proposed for some elements
with atomic numbers above 103. These superheavy elements may have a nucleus
that is relatively stable against radioactive decay.¹³¹ The most likely
candidate for a stable superheavy atom, unbihexium, has 126 protons and 184
neutrons.¹³²

Exotic matter

Main article: Exotic matter

Each particle of matter has a corresponding antimatter particle with the
opposite electrical charge. Thus, the positron is a positively charged
antielectron and the antiproton is a negatively charged equivalent of a
proton. When a matter and corresponding antimatter particle meet, they
annihilate each other. Because of this, along with an imbalance between the
number of matter and antimatter particles, the latter are rare in the
universe. The first causes of this imbalance are not yet fully understood,
although theories of baryogenesis may offer an explanation. As a result, no
antimatter atoms have been discovered in nature.¹³³ ¹³⁴ However, in 1996
the antimatter counterpart of the hydrogen atom (antihydrogen) was
synthesized at the CERN laboratory in Geneva.¹³⁵ ¹³⁶

Other exotic atoms have been created by replacing one of the protons,
neutrons or electrons with other particles that have the same charge. For
example, an electron can be replaced by a more massive muon, forming a
muonic atom. These types of atoms can be used to test the fundamental
predictions of physics.¹³⁷ ¹³⁸ ¹³⁹

Atomic nucleus

The nucleus is the small, dense region consisting of protons and neutrons
at the center of an atom. The atomic nucleus was discovered in 1911 by
Ernest Rutherford based on the 1909 Geiger–Marsden gold foil experiment.
After the discovery of the neutron in 1932, models for a nucleus composed
of protons and neutrons were quickly developed by Dmitri Ivanenko¹ and
Werner Heisenberg.² ³ ⁴ ⁵ ⁶ Almost all of the mass of an atom is located in
the nucleus, with a very small contribution from the electron cloud.
Protons and neutrons are bound together to form a nucleus by the nuclear
force.

The diameter of the nucleus is in the range of 1.75 fm (1.75×10−15 m) for
hydrogen (the diameter of a single proton)⁷ to about 15 fm for the heaviest
atoms, such as uranium. These dimensions are much smaller than the diameter
of the atom itself (nucleus + electron cloud), by a factor of about 23,000
(uranium) to about 145,000 (hydrogen).

The branch of physics concerned with the study and understanding of the
atomic nucleus, including its composition and the forces which bind it
together, is called nuclear physics.

The nucleus was discovered in 1911, as a result of Ernest Rutherford's
efforts to test Thomson's "plum pudding model" of the atom.⁸ The electron
had already been discovered earlier by J.J. Thomson himself. Knowing that
atoms are neutral, Thomson postulated that there must be a positive charge
as well. In his plum pudding model, Thomson stated that an atom consisted
of negative electrons randomly scattered within a sphere of positive
charge. Ernest Rutherford later devised an experiment, performed by Hans
Geiger and Ernest Marsden under Rutherford's direction, that involved the
deflection of alpha particles directed at a thin sheet of metal foil. He
reasoned that if Thomson's model were correct, the positively charged alpha
nuclei would easily pass through the foil with very little deviation in
their paths as the foil should act in a manner as to be neutrally charged
if the negative and positive charges are so intimately mixed as to make it
appear neutral. To his surprise, many of the particles were deflected at
very large angles. Because the mass of alpha particles is about 8000 times
that of an electron, it became apparent that a very strong force must be
present if it could deflect the massive and fast moving helium nuclei. He
realized that the plum pudding model could not be accurate and that the
deflections of the alpha particles could only be explained if the positive
and negatives charges were in fact separated from each other and that the
mass of the atom was a concentrated point of positive charge. Thus, the
idea of a nuclear atom with a dense center of positive charge and mass
became justified.

Etymology

The term nucleus is from the Latin word nucleus, a diminutive of nux
("nut"), meaning the kernel (i.e., the "small nut") inside a watery type of
fruit (like a peach). In 1844, Michael Faraday used the term to refer to
the "central point of an atom". The modern atomic meaning was proposed by
Ernest Rutherford in 1912.⁹ The adoption of the term "nucleus" to atomic
theory, however, was not immediate. In 1916, for example, Gilbert N. Lewis
stated, in his famous article The Atom and the Molecule, that "the atom is
composed of the kernel and an outer atom or shell"¹⁰

Nuclear makeup

The nucleus of an atom consists of neutrons and protons, which in turn are
the manifestation of fundamental particles, called quarks, that are held in
association by the nuclear strong force in certain stable combinations of
hadrons, called baryons. The nuclear strong force extends far enough from
each baryon so as to bind the neutrons and protons together against the
repulsive force of the positively charged protons. The nuclear strong force
has a very short range and essentially drops to zero just beyond the edge
of the nucleus. The collective action of the positively charged nucleus is
to hold the electrically negative charged electrons in their orbits about
the nucleus. The collection of negatively charged electrons orbiting the
nucleus display an affinity for certain configurations and numbers of
electrons that make their orbits stable. Which chemical element an atom
represents is determined by the number of protons in the nucleus; the atom
will have an equal number of electrons orbiting that nucleus. Individual
chemical elements can create more stable electron configurations by
combining to share their electrons. It is that sharing of electrons to
create stable electronic orbits about the nucleus that appears to us as the
chemistry of our macro world.

While protons define the entire charge of a nucleus and, hence, its
chemical identity, neutrons are electrically neutral, but contribute to the
mass of a nucleus to nearly the same extent as the protons. Neutrons
explain the phenomenon of isotopes – varieties of the same chemical element
which differ only in their atomic mass, not their chemical action.

Protons and neutrons

Protons and neutrons are fermions, with different values of the strong
isospin quantum number, so two protons and two neutrons can share the same
space wave function since they are not identical quantum entities. They
sometimes are viewed as two different quantum states of the same particle,
the nucleon.¹¹ ¹² Two fermions, such as two protons, or two neutrons, or a
proton + neutron (the deuteron) can exhibit bosonic behavior when they
become loosely bound in pairs.

In the rare case of a hypernucleus, a third baryon called a hyperon, with a
different value of the strangeness quantum number can also share the wave
function. However, the latter type of nuclei are extremely unstable and are
not found on Earth except in high energy physics experiments.

The neutron has a positively charged core of radius ≈ 0.3 fm surrounded by
a compensating negative charge of radius between 0.3 fm and 2 fm. The
proton has an approximately exponentially decaying positive charge
distribution with a mean square radius of about 0.8 fm.¹³

Forces

Nuclei are bound together by the residual strong force (nuclear force). The
residual strong force is a minor residuum of the strong interaction which
binds quarks together to form protons and neutrons. This force is much
weaker between neutrons and protons because it is mostly neutralized within
them, in the same way that electromagnetic forces between neutral atoms
(such as van der Waals forces that act between two inert gas atoms) are
much weaker than the electromagnetic forces that hold the parts of the
atoms internally together (for example, the forces that hold the electrons
in an inert gas atom bound to its nucleus).

The nuclear force is highly attractive at the distance of typical nucleon
separation, and this overwhelms the repulsion between protons which is due
to the electromagnetic force, thus allowing nuclei to exist. However,
because the residual strong force has a limited range because it decays
quickly with distance (see Yukawa potential), only nuclei smaller than a
certain size can be completely stable. The largest known completely stable
(e.g., stable to alpha, beta, and gamma decay) nucleus is lead-208 which
contains a total of 208 nucleons (126 neutrons and 82 protons). Nuclei
larger than this maximal size of 208 particles are unstable and (as a
trend) become increasingly short-lived with larger size, as the number of
neutrons and protons which compose them increases beyond this number.
However, bismuth-209 is also stable to beta decay and has the longest
half-life to alpha decay of any known isotope, estimated at a billion times
longer than the age of the universe.

The residual strong force is effective over a very short range (usually
only a few fermis; roughly one or two nucleon diameters) and causes an
attraction between any pair of nucleons. For example, between protons and
neutrons to form [NP] deuteron, and also between protons and protons, and
neutrons and neutrons.

Halo nuclei and strong force range limits

The effective absolute limit of the range of the strong force is
represented by halo nuclei such as lithium-11 or boron-14, in which
dineutrons, or other collections of neutrons, orbit at distances of about
ten fermis (roughly similar to the 8 fermi radius of the nucleus of
uranium-238). These nuclei are not maximally dense. Halo nuclei form at the
extreme edges of the chart of the nuclides—the neutron drip line and proton
drip line—and are all unstable with short half-lives, measured in
milliseconds; for example, lithium-11 has a half-life of 8.8 milliseconds.

Halos in effect represent an excited state with nucleons in an outer
quantum shell which has unfilled energy levels "below" it (both in terms of
radius and energy). The halo may be made of either neutrons [NN, NNN] or
protons [PP, PPP]. Nuclei which have a single neutron halo include ¹¹Be and
¹⁹C. A two-neutron halo is exhibited by ⁶He, ¹¹Li, ¹⁷B, ¹⁹B and ²²C.
Two-neutron halo nuclei break into three fragments, never two, and are
called Borromean nuclei because of this behavior (referring to a system of
three interlocked rings in which breaking any ring frees both of the
others). ⁸He and ¹⁴Be both exhibit a four-neutron halo. Nuclei which have a
proton halo include ⁸B and ²⁶P. A two-proton halo is exhibited by ¹⁷Ne and
²⁷S. Proton halos are expected to be more rare and unstable than the
neutron examples, because of the repulsive electromagnetic forces of the
excess proton(s).

Nuclear models

Although the standard model of physics is widely believed to completely
describe the composition and behavior of the nucleus, generating
predictions from theory is much more difficult than for most other areas of
particle physics. This is due to two reasons:

- In principle, the physics within a nuclei can be derived entirely from
  quantum chromodynamics (QCD). In practice however, current computational
  and mathematical approaches for solving QCD in low-energy systems such as
  the nuclei are extremely limited. This is due to the phase transition
  that occurs between high-energy quark matter and low-energy hadronic
  matter, which renders perturbative techniques unusable, making it
  difficult to construct an accurate QCD-derived model of the forces
  between nucleons. Current approaches are limited to either
  phenomenological models such as the Argonne v18 potential or chiral
  effective field theory.¹⁴
- Even if the nuclear force is well constrained, a significant amount of
  computational power is required to accurately compute the properties of
  nuclei ab initio. Developments in many-body theory have made this
  possible for many low mass and relatively stable nuclei, but further
  improvements in both computational power and mathematical approaches are
  required before heavy nuclei or highly unstable nuclei can be tackled.

Historically, experiments have been compared to relatively crude models
that are necessarily imperfect. None of these models can completely explain
experimental data on nuclear structure.¹⁵

The nuclear radius (R) is considered to be one of the basic quantities that
any model must predict. For stable nuclei (not halo nuclei or other
unstable distorted nuclei) the nuclear radius is roughly proportional to
the cube root of the mass number (A) of the nucleus, and particularly in
nuclei containing many nucleons, as they arrange in more spherical
configurations:

The stable nucleus has approximately a constant density and therefore the
nuclear radius R can be approximated by the following formula,

R = r_0 A^{1/3}

where A = Atomic mass number (the number of protons Z, plus the number of
neutrons N) and r₀ = 1.25 fm = 1.25 × 10−15 m. In this equation, the
constant r₀ varies by 0.2 fm, depending on the nucleus in question, but
this is less than 20% change from a constant.¹⁶

In other words, packing protons and neutrons in the nucleus gives
approximately the same total size result as packing hard spheres of a
constant size (like marbles) into a tight spherical or almost spherical bag
(some stable nuclei are not quite spherical, but are known to be prolate).

Liquid drop model

Main article: Semi-empirical mass formula

Early models of the nucleus viewed the nucleus as a rotating liquid drop.
In this model, the trade-off of long-range electromagnetic forces and
relatively short-range nuclear forces, together cause behavior which
resembled surface tension forces in liquid drops of different sizes. This
formula is successful at explaining many important phenomena of nuclei,
such as their changing amounts of binding energy as their size and
composition changes (see semi-empirical mass formula), but it does not
explain the special stability which occurs when nuclei have special "magic
numbers" of protons or neutrons.

The terms in the semi-empirical mass formula, which can be used to
approximate the binding energy of many nuclei, are considered as the sum of
five types of energies (see below). Then the picture of a nucleus as a drop
of incompressible liquid roughly accounts for the observed variation of
binding energy of the nucleus:

Volume energy. When an assembly of nucleons of the same size is packed
together into the smallest volume, each interior nucleon has a certain
number of other nucleons in contact with it. So, this nuclear energy is
proportional to the volume.

Surface energy. A nucleon at the surface of a nucleus interacts with fewer
other nucleons than one in the interior of the nucleus and hence its
binding energy is less. This surface energy term takes that into account
and is therefore negative and is proportional to the surface area.

Coulomb Energy. The electric repulsion between each pair of protons in a
nucleus contributes toward decreasing its binding energy.

Asymmetry energy (also called Pauli Energy). An energy associated with the
Pauli exclusion principle. Were it not for the Coulomb energy, the most
stable form of nuclear matter would have the same number of neutrons as
protons, since unequal numbers of neutrons and protons imply filling higher
energy levels for one type of particle, while leaving lower energy levels
vacant for the other type.

Pairing energy. An energy which is a correction term that arises from the
tendency of proton pairs and neutron pairs to occur. An even number of
particles is more stable than an odd number.

Shell models and other quantum models

Main article: Nuclear shell model

A number of models for the nucleus have also been proposed in which
nucleons occupy orbitals, much like the atomic orbitals in atomic physics
theory. These wave models imagine nucleons to be either sizeless point
particles in potential wells, or else probability waves as in the "optical
model", frictionlessly orbiting at high speed in potential wells.

In the above models, the nucleons may occupy orbitals in pairs, due to
being fermions, which allows to explain even/odd Z and N effects well-known
from experiments. The exact nature and capacity of nuclear shells differs
from those of electrons in atomic orbitals, primarily because the potential
well in which the nucleons move (especially in larger nuclei) is quite
different from the central electromagnetic potential well which binds
electrons in atoms. Some resemblance to atomic orbital models may be seen
in a small atomic nucleus like that of helium-4, in which the two protons
and two neutrons separately occupy 1s orbitals analogous to the 1s orbital
for the two electrons in the helium atom, and achieve unusual stability for
the same reason. Nuclei with 5 nucleons are all extremely unstable and
short-lived, yet, helium-3, with 3 nucleons, is very stable even with lack
of a closed 1s orbital shell. Another nucleus with 3 nucleons, the triton
hydrogen-3 is unstable and will decay into helium-3 when isolated. Weak
nuclear stability with 2 nucleons {NP} in the 1s orbital is found in the
deuteron hydrogen-2, with only one nucleon in each of the proton and
neutron potential wells. While each nucleon is a fermion, the {NP} deuteron
is a boson and thus does not follow Pauli Exclusion for close packing
within shells. Lithium-6 with 6 nucleons is highly stable without a closed
second 1p shell orbital. For light nuclei with total nucleon numbers 1 to 6
only those with 5 do not show some evidence of stability. Observations of
beta-stability of light nuclei outside closed shells indicate that nuclear
stability is much more complex than simple closure of shell orbitals with
magic numbers of protons and neutrons.

For larger nuclei, the shells occupied by nucleons begin to differ
significantly from electron shells, but nevertheless, present nuclear
theory does predict the magic numbers of filled nuclear shells for both
protons and neutrons. The closure of the stable shells predicts unusually
stable configurations, analogous to the noble group of nearly-inert gases
in chemistry. An example is the stability of the closed shell of 50
protons, which allows tin to have 10 stable isotopes, more than any other
element. Similarly, the distance from shell-closure explains the unusual
instability of isotopes which have far from stable numbers of these
particles, such as the radioactive elements 43 (technetium) and 61
(promethium), each of which is preceded and followed by 17 or more stable
elements.

There are however problems with the shell model when an attempt is made to
account for nuclear properties well away from closed shells. This has led
to complex post hoc distortions of the shape of the potential well to fit
experimental data, but the question remains whether these mathematical
manipulations actually correspond to the spatial deformations in real
nuclei. Problems with the shell model have led some to propose realistic
two-body and three-body nuclear force effects involving nucleon clusters
and then build the nucleus on this basis. Two such cluster models are the
Close-Packed Spheron Model of Linus Pauling and the 2D Ising Model of
MacGregor.¹⁵

Consistency between models

Main article: Nuclear structure

As with the case of superfluid liquid helium, atomic nuclei are an example
of a state in which both (1) "ordinary" particle physical rules for volume
and (2) non-intuitive quantum mechanical rules for a wave-like nature
apply. In superfluid helium, the helium atoms have volume, and essentially
"touch" each other, yet at the same time exhibit strange bulk properties,
consistent with a Bose–Einstein condensation. The latter reveals that they
also have a wave-like nature and do not exhibit standard fluid properties,
such as friction. For nuclei made of hadrons which are fermions, the same
type of condensation does not occur, yet nevertheless, many nuclear
properties can only be explained similarly by a combination of properties
of particles with volume, in addition to the frictionless motion
characteristic of the wave-like behavior of objects trapped in Erwin
Schrödinger's quantum orbitals.

Chemical element

A chemical element (or element) is a chemical substance consisting of atoms
having the same number of protons in their atomic nuclei (i.e. the same
atomic number, Z).¹ There are 118 elements that have been identified, of
which the first 94 occur naturally on Earth with the remaining 24 being
synthetic elements. There are 80 elements that have at least one stable
isotope and 38 that have exclusively radioactive isotopes, which decay over
time into other elements. Iron is the most abundant element (by mass)
making up the Earth, while oxygen is the most common element in the crust
of the earth.²

Chemical elements constitute approximately 15% of the matter in the
universe: the remainder is dark matter, the composition of it is unknown,
but it is not composed of chemical elements.³ The two lightest elements,
hydrogen and helium were mostly formed in the Big Bang and are the most
common elements in the universe. The next three elements (lithium,
beryllium and boron) were formed mostly by cosmic ray spallation, and are
thus more rare than those that follow. Formation of elements with from six
to twenty six protons occurred and continues to occur in main sequence
stars via stellar nucleosynthesis. The high abundance of oxygen, silicon,
and iron on Earth reflects their common production in such stars. Elements
with greater than twenty six protons are formed by supernova
nucleosynthesis in supernovae, which, when they explode, blast these
elements far into space as planetary nebulae, where they may become
incorporated into planets when they are formed.⁴

When different elements are chemically combined, with the atoms held
together by chemical bonds, they form chemical compounds. Only a minority
of elements are found uncombined as relatively pure minerals. Among the
more common of such "native elements" are copper, silver, gold, carbon (as
coal, graphite, or diamonds), and sulfur. All but a few of the most inert
elements, such as noble gases and noble metals, are usually found on Earth
in chemically combined form, as chemical compounds. While about 32 of the
chemical elements occur on Earth in native uncombined forms, most of these
occur as mixtures. For example, atmospheric air is primarily a mixture of
nitrogen, oxygen, and argon, and native solid elements occur in alloys,
such as that of iron and nickel.

The history of the discovery and use of the elements began with primitive
human societies that found native elements like carbon, sulfur, copper and
gold. Later civilizations extracted elemental copper, tin, lead and iron
from their ores by smelting, using charcoal. Alchemists and chemists
subsequently identified many more, with almost all of the
naturally-occurring elements becoming known by 1900.

The properties of the chemical elements are summarized on the periodic
table, which organizes the elements by increasing atomic number into rows
("periods") in which the columns ("groups") share recurring ("periodic")
physical and chemical properties. Save for unstable radioactive elements
with short half-lives, all of the elements are available industrially, most
of them in high degrees of purity.

Description

The lightest chemical elements are hydrogen and helium, both created by Big
Bang nucleosynthesis during the first 20 minutes of the universe⁵ in a
ratio of around 3:1 by mass (or 12:1 by number of atoms),⁶ ⁷ along with
tiny traces of the next two elements, lithium and beryllium. Almost all
other elements found in nature were made by various natural methods of
nucleosynthesis.⁸ On Earth, small amounts of new atoms are naturally
produced in nucleogenic reactions, or in cosmogenic processes, such as
cosmic ray spallation. New atoms are also naturally produced on Earth as
radiogenic daughter isotopes of ongoing radioactive decay processes such as
alpha decay, beta decay, spontaneous fission, cluster decay, and other
rarer modes of decay.

Of the 94 naturally occurring elements, those with atomic numbers 1 through
82 each have at least one stable isotope, (except for technetium, element
43 and promethium, element 61, which have no stable isotopes). Isotopes
considered stable are those for which no radioactive decay has yet been
observed. Elements with atomic numbers 83 through 94 are unstable to the
point that radioactive decay of all isotopes can be detected. Some of these
elements, notably bismuth (atomic number 83), thorium (atomic number 90),
uranium (atomic number 92) and plutonium (atomic number 94), have one or
more isotopes with half-lives long enough to survive as remnants of the
explosive stellar nucleosynthesis that produced the heavy elements before
the formation of our solar system. For example, at over 1.9×10¹⁹ years,
over a billion times longer than the current estimated age of the universe,
bismuth-209 (atomic number 83) has the longest known alpha decay half-life
of any naturally occurring element.⁹ ¹⁰ The very heaviest elements (those
beyond plutonium, element 94) undergo radioactive decay with half-lives so
short that they do not occur in nature and must be synthesized.

As of 2010, there are 118 known elements (in this context, "known" means
observed well enough, even from just a few decay products, to have been
differentiated from other elements).¹¹ ¹² Of these 118 elements, 98 occur
naturally on Earth.¹³ Ten of these occur in extreme trace quantities:
technetium, atomic number 43; promethium, number 61; astatine, number 85;
francium, number 87; neptunium, number 93; and plutonium, number 94. These
94 elements have been detected in the universe at large, in the spectra of
stars and also supernovae, where short-lived radioactive elements are newly
being made. The first 94 elements have been detected directly on Earth as
primordial nuclides present from the formation of the solar system, or as
naturally-occurring fission or transmutation products of uranium and
thorium.

The remaining 20 heavier elements, not found today either on Earth or in
astronomical spectra, have been produced artificially: these are all
radioactive, with very short half-lives; if any atoms of these elements
were present at the formation of Earth, they are extremely likely, to the
point of certainty, to have already decayed, and if present in novae, have
been in quantities too small to have been noted. Technetium was the first
purportedly non-naturally occurring element synthesized, in 1937, although
trace amounts of technetium have since been found in nature (and also the
element may have been discovered naturally in 1925).¹⁴ This pattern of
artificial production and later natural discovery has been repeated with
several other radioactive naturally-occurring rare elements.¹⁵

Lists of the elements are available by name, by symbol, by atomic number,
by density, by melting point, and by boiling point as well as ionization
energies of the elements. The nuclides of stable and radioactive elements
are also available as a list of nuclides, sorted by length of half-life for
those that are unstable. One of the most convenient, and certainly the most
traditional presentation of the elements, is in the form of the periodic
table, which groups together elements with similar chemical properties (and
usually also similar electronic structures).

Atomic number

Main article: atomic number

The atomic number of an element is equal to the number of protons in each
atom, and defines the element.¹⁶ For example, all carbon atoms contain 6
protons in their atomic nucleus; so the atomic number of carbon is 6.¹⁷
Carbon atoms may have different numbers of neutrons; atoms of the same
element having different numbers of neutrons are known as isotopes of the
element.¹⁸

The number of protons in the atomic nucleus also determines its electric
charge, which in turn determines the number of electrons of the atom in its
non-ionized state. The electrons are placed into atomic orbitals that
determine the atom's various chemical properties. The number of neutrons in
a nucleus usually has very little effect on an element's chemical
properties (except in the case of hydrogen and deuterium). Thus, all carbon
isotopes have nearly identical chemical properties because they all have
six protons and six electrons, even though carbon atoms may, for example,
have 6 or 8 neutrons. That is why the atomic number, rather than mass
number or atomic weight, is considered the identifying characteristic of a
chemical element.

The symbol for atomic number is Z.

Isotopes

Main articles: Isotope, Stable isotope and List of nuclides

Isotopes are atoms of the same element (that is, with the same number of
protons in their atomic nucleus), but having different numbers of neutrons.
Most (66 of 94) naturally occurring elements have more than one stable
isotope. Thus, for example, there are three main isotopes of carbon. All
carbon atoms have 6 protons in the nucleus, but they can have either 6, 7,
or 8 neutrons. Since the mass numbers of these are 12, 13 and 14
respectively, the three isotopes of carbon are known as carbon-12,
carbon-13, and carbon-14, often abbreviated to ¹²C, ¹³C, and ¹⁴C. Carbon in
everyday life and in chemistry is a mixture of ¹²C (about 98.9%), ¹³C
(about 1.1%) and about 1 atom per trillion of ¹⁴C.

Except in the case of the isotopes of hydrogen (which differ greatly from
each other in relative mass—enough to cause chemical effects), the isotopes
of a given element are chemically nearly indistinguishable.

All of the elements have some isotopes that are radioactive
(radioisotopes), although not all of these radioisotopes occur naturally.
The radioisotopes typically decay into other elements upon radiating an
alpha or beta particle. If an element has isotopes that are not
radioactive, these are termed "stable" isotopes. All of the known stable
isotopes occur naturally (see primordial isotope). The many radioisotopes
that are not found in nature have been characterized after being
artificially made. Certain elements have no stable isotopes and are
composed only of radioactive isotopes: specifically the elements without
any stable isotopes are technetium (atomic number 43), promethium (atomic
number 61), and all observed elements with atomic numbers greater than 82.

Of the 80 elements with at least one stable isotope, 26 have only one
single stable isotope. The mean number of stable isotopes for the 80 stable
elements is 3.1 stable isotopes per element. The largest number of stable
isotopes that occur for a single element is 10 (for tin, element 50).

Isotopic mass and atomic mass

Main articles: atomic mass and relative atomic mass

The mass number of an element, A, is the number of nucleons (protons and
neutrons) in the atomic nucleus. Different isotopes of a given element are
distinguished by their mass numbers, which are conventionally written as a
superscript on the left hand side of the atomic symbol (e.g., ²³⁸U). The
mass number is always a simple whole number and has units of "nucleons." An
example of a referral to a mass number is "magnesium-24," which is an atom
with 24 nucleons (12 protons and 12 neutrons).

Whereas the mass number simply counts the total number of neutrons and
protons and is thus a natural (or whole) number, the atomic mass of a
single atom is a real number for the mass of a particular isotope of the
element, the unit being u. In general, when expressed in u it differs in
value slightly from the mass number for a given nuclide (or isotope) since
the mass of the protons and neutrons is not exactly 1 u, since the
electrons contribute a lesser share to the atomic mass as neutron number
exceeds proton number, and (finally) because of the nuclear binding energy.
For example, the atomic mass of chlorine-35 to five significant digits is
34.969 u and that of chlorine-37 is 36.966 u. However, the atomic mass in u
of each isotope is quite close to its simple mass number (always within
1%). The only isotope whose atomic mass is exactly a natural number is ¹²C,
which by definition has a mass of exactly 12, because u is defined as 1/12
of the mass of a free neutral carbon-12 atom in the ground state.

The relative atomic mass (historically and commonly also called "atomic
weight") of an element is the average of the atomic masses of all the
chemical element's isotopes as found in a particular environment, weighted
by isotopic abundance, relative to the atomic mass unit (u). This number
may be a fraction that is not close to a whole number, due to the averaging
process. For example, the relative atomic mass of chlorine is 35.453 u,
which differs greatly from a whole number due to being made of an average
of 76% chlorine-35 and 24% chlorine-37. Whenever a relative atomic mass
value differs by more than 1% from a whole number, it is due to this
averaging effect resulting from significant amounts of more than one
isotope being naturally present in the sample of the element in question.

Chemically pure and isotopically pure

Chemists and nuclear scientists have different definitions of a pure
element. In chemistry, a pure element means a substance whose atoms all (or
in practice almost all) have the same atomic number, or number of protons.
Nuclear scientists, however, define a pure element as one that consists of
only one stable isotope.¹⁹

For example, a copper wire is 99.99% chemically pure if 99.99% of its atoms
are copper, with 29 protons each. However it is not isotopically pure since
ordinary copper consists of two stable isotopes, 69% ⁶³Cu and 31% ⁶⁵Cu,
with different numbers of neutrons.

Allotropes

Main article: Allotropy

Atoms of chemically pure elements may bond to each other chemically in more
than one way, allowing the pure element to exist in multiple structures
(spatial arrangements of atoms), known as allotropes, which differ in their
properties. For example, carbon can be found as diamond, which has a
tetrahedral structure around each carbon atom; graphite, which has layers
of carbon atoms with a hexagonal structure stacked on top of each other;
graphene, which is a single layer of graphite that is very strong;
fullerenes, which have nearly spherical shapes; and carbon nanotubes, which
are tubes with a hexagonal structure (even these may differ from each other
in electrical properties). The ability of an element to exist in one of
many structural forms is known as 'allotropy'.

The standard state, also known as reference state, of an element is defined
as its thermodynamically most stable state at 1 bar at a given temperature
(typically at 298.15 K). In thermochemistry, an element is defined to have
an enthalpy of formation of zero in its standard state. For example, the
reference state for carbon is graphite, because the structure of graphite
is more stable than that of the other allotropes.

Properties

Several kinds of descriptive categorizations can be applied broadly to the
elements, including consideration of their general physical and chemical
properties, their states of matter under familiar conditions, their melting
and boiling points, their densities, their crystal structures as solids,
and their origins.

General properties

Several terms are commonly used to characterize the general physical and
chemical properties of the chemical elements. A first distinction is
between metals, which readily conduct electricity, nonmetals, which do not,
and a small group, (the metalloids), having intermediate properties and
often behaving as semiconductors.

A more refined classification is often shown in colored presentations of
the periodic table. This system restricts the terms "metal" and "nonmetal"
to only certain of the more broadly defined metals and nonmetals, adding
additional terms for certain sets of the more broadly viewed metals and
nonmetals. The version of this classification used in the periodic tables
presented here includes: actinides, alkali metals, alkaline earth metals,
halogens, lanthanides, transition metals, post-transition metals;
metalloids, noble gases, polyatomic nonmetals, diatomic nonmetals, and
transition metals. In this system, the alkali metals, alkaline earth
metals, and transition metals, as well as the lanthanides and the
actinides, are special groups of the metals viewed in a broader sense.
Similarly, the polyatomic nonmetals, diatomic nonmetals and the noble gases
are nonmetals viewed in the broader sense. In some presentations, the
halogens are not distinguished, with astatine identified as a metalloid and
the others identified as nonmetals.

States of matter

Another commonly used basic distinction among the elements is their state
of matter (phase), whether solid, liquid, or gas, at a selected standard
temperature and pressure (STP). Most of the elements are solids at
conventional temperatures and atmospheric pressure, while several are
gases. Only bromine and mercury are liquids at 0 degrees Celsius (32
degrees Fahrenheit) and normal atmospheric pressure; caesium and gallium
are solids at that temperature, but melt at 28.4 °C (83.2 °F) and 29.8 °C
(85.6 °F), respectively.

Melting and boiling points

Melting and boiling points, typically expressed in degrees Celsius at a
pressure of one atmosphere, are commonly used in characterizing the various
elements. While known for most elements, either or both of these
measurements is still undetermined for some of the radioactive elements
available in only tiny quantities. Since helium remains a liquid even at
absolute zero at atmospheric pressure, it has only a boiling point, and not
a melting point, in conventional presentations.

Densities

Main article: Densities of the elements (data page)

The density at a selected standard temperature and pressure (STP) is
frequently used in characterizing the elements. Density is often expressed
in grams per cubic centimeter (g/cm³). Since several elements are gases at
commonly encountered temperatures, their densities are usually stated for
their gaseous forms; when liquefied or solidified, the gaseous elements
have densities similar to those of the other elements.

When an element has allotropes with different densities, one representative
allotrope is typically selected in summary presentations, while densities
for each allotrope can be stated where more detail is provided. For
example, the three familiar allotropes of carbon (amorphous carbon,
graphite, and diamond) have densities of 1.8–2.1, 2.267, and 3.515 g/cm³,
respectively.

Crystal structures

The elements studied to date as solid samples have eight kinds of crystal
structures: cubic, body-centered cubic, face-centered cubic, hexagonal,
monoclinic, orthorhombic, rhombohedral, and tetragonal. For some of the
synthetically produced transuranic elements, available samples have been
too small to determine crystal structures.

Occurrence and origin on Earth

Chemical elements may also be categorized by their origin on Earth, with
the first 94 considered naturally occurring, while those with atomic
numbers beyond 94 have only been produced artificially as the synthetic
products of man-made nuclear reactions.

Of the 94 naturally occurring elements, 84 are considered primordial and
either stable or weakly radioactive. The remaining 10 naturally occurring
elements possess half lives too short for them to have been present at the
beginning of the Solar System, and are therefore considered transient
elements. Of these 10 transient elements, 5 (polonium, radon, radium,
actinium, and protactinium) are relatively common decay products of
thorium, uranium, and plutonium. The remaining 5 transient elements
(technetium, promethium, astatine, francium, and neptunium) occur only
rarely, as products of rare decay modes or nuclear reaction processes
involving uranium or other heavy elements.

Elements with atomic numbers 1 through 40 are all stable, while those with
atomic numbers 41 through 82 (except technetium and promethium) are
metastable. The half-lives of these metastable "theoretical radionuclides"
are so long (at least 100 million times longer than the estimated age of
the universe) that their radioactive decay has yet to be detected by
experiment. Elements with atomic numbers 83 through 94 are unstable to the
point that their radioactive decay can be detected. Four of these elements,
bismuth (element 83), thorium (element 90), uranium (element 92), and
plutonium (element 94), have one or more isotopes with half-lives long
enough to survive as remnants of the explosive stellar nucleosynthesis that
produced the heavy elements before the formation of our solar system. For
example, at over 1.9×10¹⁹ years, over a billion times longer than the
current estimated age of the universe, bismuth-209 has the longest known
alpha decay half-life of any naturally occurring element.⁹ ¹⁰ The very
heaviest elements (those beyond plutonium, element 94) undergo radioactive
decay with short half-lives and do not occur in nature.

The periodic table

Main article: Periodic table

The properties of the chemical elements are often summarized using the
periodic table, which powerfully and elegantly organizes the elements by
increasing atomic number into rows ("periods") in which the columns
("groups") share recurring ("periodic") physical and chemical properties.
The current standard table contains 118 confirmed elements as of 10 April
2010.

Although earlier precursors to this presentation exist, its invention is
generally credited to the Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleev in 1869, who
intended the table to illustrate recurring trends in the properties of the
elements. The layout of the table has been refined and extended over time
as new elements have been discovered and new theoretical models have been
developed to explain chemical behavior.

Use of the periodic table is now ubiquitous within the academic discipline
of chemistry, providing an extremely useful framework to classify,
systematize and compare all the many different forms of chemical behavior.
The table has also found wide application in physics, geology, biology,
materials science, engineering, agriculture, medicine, nutrition,
environmental health, and astronomy. Its principles are especially
important in chemical engineering.

Nomenclature and symbols

The various chemical elements are formally identified by their unique
atomic numbers, by their accepted names, and by their symbols.

Atomic numbers

The known elements have atomic numbers from 1 through 118, conventionally
presented as Arabic numerals. Since the elements can be uniquely sequenced
by atomic number, conventionally from lowest to highest (as in a periodic
table), sets of elements are sometimes specified by such notation as
"through", "beyond", or "from ... through", as in "through iron", "beyond
uranium", or "from lanthanum through lutetium". The terms "light" and
"heavy" are sometimes also used informally to indicate relative atomic
numbers (not densities!), as in "lighter than carbon" or "heavier than
lead", although technically the weight or mass of atoms of an element
(their atomic weights or atomic masses) do not always increase
monotonically with their atomic numbers.

Element names

Main article: List of chemical element name etymologies

The naming of various substances now known as elements precedes the atomic
theory of matter, as names were given locally by various cultures to
various minerals, metals, compounds, alloys, mixtures, and other materials,
although at the time it was not known which chemicals were elements and
which compounds. As they were identified as elements, the existing names
for anciently-known elements (e.g., gold, mercury, iron) were kept in most
countries. National differences emerged over the names of elements either
for convenience, linguistic niceties, or nationalism. For a few
illustrative examples: German speakers use "Wasserstoff" (water substance)
for "hydrogen", "Sauerstoff" (acid substance) for "oxygen" and "Stickstoff"
(smothering substance) for "nitrogen", while English and some romance
languages use "sodium" for "natrium" and "potassium" for "kalium", and the
French, Italians, Greeks, Portuguese and Poles prefer "azote/azot/azoto"
(from roots meaning "no life") for "nitrogen".

For purposes of international communication and trade, the official names
of the chemical elements both ancient and more recently recognized are
decided by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC),
which has decided on a sort of international English language, drawing on
traditional English names even when an element's chemical symbol is based
on a Latin or other traditional word, for example adopting "gold" rather
than "aurum" as the name for the 79th element (Au). IUPAC prefers the
British spellings "aluminium" and "caesium" over the U.S. spellings
"aluminum" and "cesium", and the U.S. "sulfur" over the British "sulphur".
However, elements that are practical to sell in bulk in many countries
often still have locally used national names, and countries whose national
language does not use the Latin alphabet are likely to use the IUPAC
element names.

According to IUPAC, chemical elements are not proper nouns in English;
consequently, the full name of an element is not routinely capitalized in
English, even if derived from a proper noun, as in californium and
einsteinium. Isotope names of chemical elements are also uncapitalized if
written out, e.g., carbon-12 or uranium-235. Chemical element symbols (such
as Cf for californium and Es for einsteinium), are always capitalized (see
below).

In the second half of the twentieth century, physics laboratories became
able to produce nuclei of chemical elements with half-lives too short for
an appreciable amount of them to exist at any time. These are also named by
IUPAC, which generally adopts the name chosen by the discoverer. This
practice can lead to the controversial question of which research group
actually discovered an element, a question that delayed the naming of
elements with atomic number of 104 and higher for a considerable time. (See
element naming controversy).

Precursors of such controversies involved the nationalistic namings of
elements in the late 19th century. For example, lutetium was named in
reference to Paris, France. The Germans were reluctant to relinquish naming
rights to the French, often calling it cassiopeium. Similarly, the British
discoverer of niobium originally named it columbium, in reference to the
New World. It was used extensively as such by American publications prior
to international standardization.

Chemical symbols

For listings of current chemical symbols, symbols not currently used, and
other symbols that may look like chemical symbols, see Symbol (chemistry).

Specific chemical elements

Before chemistry became a science, alchemists had designed arcane symbols
for both metals and common compounds. These were however used as
abbreviations in diagrams or procedures; there was no concept of atoms
combining to form molecules. With his advances in the atomic theory of
matter, John Dalton devised his own simpler symbols, based on circles, to
depict molecules.

The current system of chemical notation was invented by Berzelius. In this
typographical system, chemical symbols are not mere abbreviations—though
each consists of letters of the Latin alphabet. They are intended as
universal symbols for people of all languages and alphabets.

The first of these symbols were intended to be fully universal. Since Latin
was the common language of science at that time, they were abbreviations
based on the Latin names of metals. Cu comes from Cuprum, Fe comes from
Ferrum, Ag from Argentum. The symbols were not followed by a period (full
stop) as with abbreviations. Later chemical elements were also assigned
unique chemical symbols, based on the name of the element, but not
necessarily in English. For example, sodium has the chemical symbol 'Na'
after the Latin natrium. The same applies to "W" (wolfram) for tungsten,
"Fe" (ferrum) for iron, "Hg" (hydrargyrum) for mercury, "Sn" (stannum) for
tin, "K" (kalium) for potassium, "Au" (aurum) for gold, "Ag" (argentum) for
silver, "Pb" (plumbum) for lead, "Cu" (cuprum) for copper, and "Sb"
(stibium) for antimony.

Chemical symbols are understood internationally when element names might
require translation. There have sometimes been differences in the past. For
example, Germans in the past have used "J" (for the alternate name Jod) for
iodine, but now use "I" and "Iod."

The first letter of a chemical symbol is always capitalized, as in the
preceding examples, and the subsequent letters, if any, are always lower
case (small letters). Thus, the symbols for californium or einsteinium are
Cf and Es.

General chemical symbols

There are also symbols in chemical equations for groups of chemical
elements, for example in comparative formulas. These are often a single
capital letter, and the letters are reserved and not used for names of
specific elements. For example, an "X" indicates a variable group (usually
a halogen) in a class of compounds, while "R" is a radical, meaning a
compound structure such as a hydrocarbon chain. The letter "Q" is reserved
for "heat" in a chemical reaction. "Y" is also often used as a general
chemical symbol, although it is also the symbol of yttrium. "Z" is also
frequently used as a general variable group. "E" is used in organic
chemistry to denote an electron-withdrawing group. "L" is used to represent
a general ligand in inorganic and organometallic chemistry. "M" is also
often used in place of a general metal.

At least two additional, two-letter generic chemical symbols are also in
informal usage, "Ln" for any lanthanide element and "An" for any actinide
element. "Rg" was formerly used for any rare gas element, but the group of
rare gases has now been renamed noble gases and the symbol "Rg" has now
been assigned to the element roentgenium.

Isotope symbols

Isotopes are distinguished by the atomic mass number (total protons and
neutrons) for a particular isotope of an element, with this number combined
with the pertinent element's symbol. IUPAC prefers that isotope symbols be
written in superscript notation when practical, for example ¹²C and ²³⁵U.
However, other notations, such as carbon-12 and uranium-235, or C-12 and
U-235, are also used.

As a special case, the three naturally occurring isotopes of the element
hydrogen are often specified as H for ¹H (protium), D for ²H (deuterium),
and T for ³H (tritium). This convention is easier to use in chemical
equations, replacing the need to write out the mass number for each atom.
For example, the formula for heavy water may be written D₂O instead of
²H₂O.

Origin of the elements

Only about 4% of the total mass of the universe is made of atoms or ions,
and thus represented by chemical elements. This fraction is about 15% of
the total matter, with the remainder of the matter (85%) being dark matter.
The nature of dark matter is unknown, but it is not composed of atoms of
chemical elements because it contains no protons, neutrons, or electrons.
(The remaining non-matter part of the mass of the universe is composed of
the even more mysterious dark energy).

The universe's 94 naturally occurring chemical elements are thought to have
been produced by at least four cosmic processes. Most of the hydrogen and
helium in the universe was produced primordially in the first few minutes
of the Big Bang. Three recurrently occurring later processes are thought to
have produced the remaining elements. Stellar nucleosynthesis, an ongoing
process, produces all elements from carbon through iron in atomic number,
but little lithium, beryllium, or boron. Elements heavier in atomic number
than iron, as heavy as uranium and plutonium, are produced by explosive
nucleosynthesis in supernovas and other cataclysmic cosmic events. Cosmic
ray spallation (fragmentation) of carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen is important
to the production of lithium, beryllium and boron.

During the early phases of the Big Bang, nucleosynthesis of hydrogen nuclei
resulted in the production of hydrogen-1 (protium, ¹H) and helium-4 (⁴He),
as well as a smaller amount of deuterium (²H) and very minuscule amounts
(on the order of 10−10) of lithium and beryllium. Even smaller amounts of
boron may have been produced in the Big Bang, since it has been observed in
some very old stars, while carbon has not.²⁰ It is generally agreed that no
heavier elements than boron were produced in the Big Bang. As a result, the
primordial abundance of atoms (or ions) consisted of roughly 75% ¹H, 25%
⁴He, and 0.01% deuterium, with only tiny traces of lithium, beryllium, and
perhaps boron.²¹ Subsequent enrichment of galactic halos occurred due to
stellar nucleosynthesis and supernova nucleosynthesis.²² However, the
element abundance in intergalactic space can still closely resemble
primordial conditions, unless it has been enriched by some means.

On Earth (and elsewhere), trace amounts of various elements continue to be
produced from other elements as products of natural transmutation
processes. These include some produced by cosmic rays or other nuclear
reactions (see cosmogenic and nucleogenic nuclides), and others produced as
decay products of long-lived primordial nuclides.²³ For example, trace (but
detectable) amounts of carbon-14 (¹⁴C) are continually produced in the
atmosphere by cosmic rays impacting nitrogen atoms, and argon-40 (⁴⁰Ar) is
continually produced by the decay of primordially occurring but unstable
potassium-40 (⁴⁰K). Also, three primordially occurring but radioactive
actinides, thorium, uranium, and plutonium, decay through a series of
recurrently produced but unstable radioactive elements such as radium and
radon, which are transiently present in any sample of these metals or their
ores or compounds. Three other radioactive elements, technetium,
promethium, and neptunium, occur only incidentally in natural materials,
produced as individual atoms by natural fission of the nuclei of various
heavy elements or in other rare nuclear processes.

Human technology has produced various additional elements beyond these
first 94, with those through atomic number 118 now known.

Abundance

Main article: Abundance of the chemical elements

The following graph (note log scale) shows the abundance of elements in our
solar system. The table shows the twelve most common elements in our galaxy
(estimated spectroscopically), as measured in parts per million, by mass.²⁴
Nearby galaxies that have evolved along similar lines have a corresponding
enrichment of elements heavier than hydrogen and helium. The more distant
galaxies are being viewed as they appeared in the past, so their abundances
of elements appear closer to the primordial mixture. As physical laws and
processes appear common throughout the visible universe, however, scientist
expect that these galaxies evolved elements in similar abundance.

The abundance of elements in the Solar System is in keeping with their
origin from nucleosynthesis in the Big Bang and a number of progenitor
supernova stars. Very abundant hydrogen and helium are products of the Big
Bang, but the next three elements are rare since they had little time to
form in the Big Bang and are not made in stars (they are, however, produced
in small quantities by the breakup of heavier elements in interstellar
dust, as a result of impact by cosmic rays). Beginning with carbon,
elements are produced in stars by buildup from alpha particles (helium
nuclei), resulting in an alternatingly larger abundance of elements with
even atomic numbers (these are also more stable). In general, such elements
up to iron are made in large stars in the process of becoming supernovas.
Iron-56 is particularly common, since it is the most stable element that
can easily be made from alpha particles (being a product of decay of
radioactive nickel-56, ultimately made from 14 helium nuclei). Elements
heavier than iron are made in energy-absorbing processes in large stars,
and their abundance in the universe (and on Earth) generally decreases with
their atomic number.

The abundance of the chemical elements on Earth varies from air to crust to
ocean, and in various types of life. The abundance of elements in Earth's
crust differs from that in the Solar system (as seen in the Sun and heavy
planets like Jupiter) mainly in selective loss of the very lightest
elements (hydrogen and helium) and also volatile neon, carbon (as
hydrocarbons), nitrogen and sulfur, as a result of solar heating in the
early formation of the solar system. Oxygen, the most abundant Earth
element by mass, is retained on Earth by combination with silicon. Aluminum
at 8% by mass is more common in the Earth's crust than in the universe and
solar system, but the composition of the far more bulky mantle, which has
magnesium and iron in place of aluminum (which occurs there only at 2% of
mass) more closely mirrors the elemental composition of the solar system,
save for the noted loss of volatile elements to space, and loss of iron
which has migrated to the Earth's core.

The composition of the human body, by contrast, more closely follows the
composition of seawater—save that the human body has additional stores of
carbon and nitrogen necessary to form the proteins and nucleic acids,
together with phosphorus in the nucleic acids and energy transfer molecule
adenosine triphosphate (ATP) that occurs in the cells of all living
organisms. Certain kinds of organisms require particular additional
elements, for example the magnesium in chlorophyll in green plants, the
calcium in mollusc shells, or the iron in the hemoglobin in vertebrate
animals' red blood cells.

History

Evolving definitions

The concept of an "element" as an undivisible substance has developed
through three major historical phases: Classical definitions (such as those
of the ancient Greeks), chemical definitions, and atomic definitions.

Classical definitions

Ancient philosophy posited a set of classical elements to explain observed
patterns in nature. These elements originally referred to earth, water, air
and fire rather than the chemical elements of modern science.

The term 'elements' (stoicheia) was first used by the Greek philosopher
Plato in about 360 BCE in his dialogue Timaeus, which includes a discussion
of the composition of inorganic and organic bodies and is a speculative
treatise on chemistry. Plato believed the elements introduced a century
earlier by Empedocles were composed of small polyhedral forms: tetrahedron
(fire), octahedron (air), icosahedron (water), and cube (earth).²⁵ ²⁶

Aristotle, c. 350 BCE, also used the term stoicheia and added a fifth
element called aether, which formed the heavens. Aristotle defined an
element as:

  Element – one of those bodies into which other bodies can decompose, and
  that itself is not capable of being divided into other.²⁷

Chemical definitions

In 1661, Robert Boyle proposed his theory of corpuscularism which favoured
the analysis of matter as constituted by irreducible units of matter
(atoms) and, choosing to side with neither Aristotle's view of the four
elements nor Paracelsus' view of three fundamental elements, left open the
question of the number of elements.²⁸ The first modern list of chemical
elements was given in Antoine Lavoisier's 1789 Elements of Chemistry, which
contained thirty-three elements, including light and caloric.²⁹ By 1818,
Jöns Jakob Berzelius had determined atomic weights for forty-five of the
forty-nine then-accepted elements. Dmitri Mendeleev had sixty-six elements
in his periodic table of 1869.

From Boyle until the early 20th century, an element was defined as a pure
substance that could not be decomposed into any simpler substance.²⁸ Put
another way, a chemical element cannot be transformed into other chemical
elements by chemical processes. Elements during this time were generally
distinguished by their atomic weights, a property measurable with fair
accuracy by available analytical techniques.

Atomic definitions

The 1913 discovery by English physicist Henry Moseley that the nuclear
charge is the physical basis for an atom's atomic number, further refined
when the nature of protons and neutrons became appreciated, eventually led
to the current definition of an element based on atomic number (number of
protons per atomic nucleus). The use of atomic numbers, rather than atomic
weights, to distinguish elements has greater predictive value (since these
numbers are integers), and also resolves some ambiguities in the
chemistry-based view due to varying properties of isotopes and allotropes
within the same element. Currently, IUPAC defines an element to exist if it
has isotopes with a lifetime longer than the 10−14 seconds it takes the
nucleus to form an electronic cloud.³⁰

By 1914, seventy-two elements were known, all naturally occurring.³¹ The
remaining naturally occurring elements were discovered or isolated in
subsequent decades, and various additional elements have also been produced
synthetically, with much of that work pioneered by Glenn T. Seaborg. In
1955, element 101 was discovered and named mendelevium in honor of D.I.
Mendeleev, the first to arrange the elements in a periodic manner. Most
recently, the synthesis of element 118 was reported in October 2006, and
the synthesis of element 117 was reported in April 2010.³²

Discovery and recognition of various elements

See also: Timeline of chemical elements discoveries

Ten materials familiar to various prehistoric cultures are now known to be
chemical elements: Carbon, copper, gold, iron, lead, mercury, silver,
sulfur, tin, and zinc. Three additional materials now accepted as elements,
arsenic, antimony, and bismuth, were recognized as distinct substances
prior to 1500 AD. Phosphorus, cobalt, and platinum were isolated before
1750.

Most of the remaining naturally occurring chemical elements were identified
and characterized by 1900, including:

- Such now-familiar industrial materials as aluminium, silicon, nickel,
  chromium, magnesium, and tungsten
- Reactive metals such as lithium, sodium, potassium, and calcium
- The halogens fluorine, chlorine, bromine, and iodine
- Gases such as hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, helium, argon, and neon
- Most of the rare-earth elements, including cerium, lanthanum, gadolinium,
  and neodymium.
- The more common radioactive elements, including uranium, thorium, radium,
  and radon

Elements isolated or produced since 1900 include:

- The three remaining undiscovered regularly occurring stable natural
  elements: hafnium, lutetium, and rhenium
- Plutonium, which was first produced synthetically in 1940 by Glenn T.
  Seaborg, but is now also known from a few long-persisting natural
  occurrences
- The seven incidentally occurring natural elements (americium, berkelium,
  californium, curium, neptunium, promethium, and technetium), which were
  all first produced synthetically but later discovered in trace amounts in
  certain geological samples
- Three scarce decay products of uranium or thorium, (astatine, francium,
  and protactinium), and
- Various synthetic transuranic elements, beginning with einsteinium,
  fermium, mendelevium, nobelium, and lawrencium

Recently discovered elements

The first transuranium element (element with atomic number greater than 92)
discovered was neptunium in 1940. Since 1999 claims for the discovery of
new elements have been considered by the IUPAC/IUPAP Joint Working Party.
As of May 2012, only the elements up to 112, copernicium, as well as
element 114 (flerovium) and element 116 (livermorium) have been confirmed
as discovered by IUPAC, while claims have been made for synthesis of
elements 113, 115, 117³³ and 118. The discovery of element 112 was
acknowledged in 2009, and the name copernicium and the atomic symbol Cn
were suggested for it.³⁴ The name and symbol were officially endorsed by
IUPAC on 19 February 2010.³⁵ The heaviest element that is believed to have
been synthesized to date is element 118, ununoctium, on 9 October 2006, by
the Flerov Laboratory of Nuclear Reactions in Dubna, Russia.¹² ³⁶ Element
117 was the latest element claimed to be discovered, in 2009.³³ IUPAC
officially recognized flerovium and livermorium, elements 114 and 116, in
June 2011 and approved their names in May 2012.³⁷

Deuterium

Deuterium (symbol D or 2H, also known as heavy hydrogen) is one of two
stable isotopes of hydrogen. The nucleus of deuterium, called a deuteron,
contains one proton and one neutron, whereas the far more common hydrogen
isotope, protium, has no neutron in the nucleus. Deuterium has a natural
abundance in Earth's oceans of about one atom in 6420 of hydrogen. Thus
deuterium accounts for approximately 0.0156% (or on a mass basis 0.0312%)
of all the naturally occurring hydrogen in the oceans, while the most
common isotope (hydrogen-1 or protium) accounts for more than 99.98%. The
abundance of deuterium changes slightly from one kind of natural water to
another (see Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water).

The deuterium isotope's name is formed from the Greek deuteros meaning
"second", to denote the two particles composing the nucleus.¹ Deuterium was
discovered and named in 1931 by Harold Urey, earning him a Nobel Prize in
1934. This was followed by the discovery of the neutron in 1932, which made
the nuclear structure of deuterium obvious. Soon after deuterium's
discovery, Urey and others produced samples of "heavy water" in which the
deuterium had been highly concentrated.

Deuterium is destroyed in the interiors of stars faster than it is
produced. Other natural processes are thought to produce only an
insignificant amount of deuterium. Theoretically nearly all deuterium found
in nature was produced in the Big Bang 13.8 billion years ago, as the basic
or primordial ratio of hydrogen-1 (protium) to deuterium (about 26 atoms of
deuterium per million hydrogen atoms) has its origin from that time. This
is the ratio found in the gas giant planets, such as Jupiter (see
references 2,3 and 4). However, other astronomical bodies are found to have
different ratios of deuterium to hydrogen-1. This is thought to be as a
result of natural isotope separation processes that occur from solar
heating of ices in comets. Like the water-cycle in Earth's weather, such
heating processes may enrich deuterium with respect to protium. The
analysis of deuterium/protium ratios in comets found results very similar
to the mean ratio in Earth's oceans (156 atoms of deuterium per million
hydrogens). This reinforces theories that much of Earth's ocean water is of
cometary origin.² ³ The deuterium/protium ratio of the comet
67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, as measured by the Rosetta space probe, is about
three times that of earth water. This figure is the highest yet measured in
a comet.⁴

Deuterium/protium ratios thus continue to be an active topic of research in
both astronomy and climatology.

Differences between deuterium and common hydrogen (protium)

Chemical symbol

Deuterium is frequently represented by the chemical symbol D. Since it is
an isotope of hydrogen with mass number 2, it is also represented by 2H.
IUPAC allows both D and 2H, although 2H is preferred.⁵ A distinct chemical
symbol is used for convenience because of the isotope's common use in
various scientific processes. Also, its large mass difference with protium
(1H) (deuterium has a mass of 2.014102 u, compared to the mean hydrogen
atomic weight of 1.007947 u, and protium's mass of 1.007825 u) confers
non-negligible chemical dissimilarities with protium-containing compounds,
whereas the isotope weight ratios within other chemical elements are
largely insignificant in this regard.

Spectroscopy

In quantum mechanics the energy levels of electrons in atoms depend on the
reduced mass of the system of electron and nucleus. For the hydrogen atom,
the role of reduced mass is most simply seen in the Bohr model of the atom,
where the reduced mass appears in a simple calculation of the Rydberg
constant and Rydberg equation, but the reduced mass also appears in the
Schrödinger equation, and the Dirac equation for calculating atomic energy
levels.

The reduced mass of the system in these equations is close to the mass of a
single electron, but differs from it by a small amount about equal to the
ratio of mass of the electron to the atomic nucleus. For hydrogen, this
amount is about 1837/1836, or 1.000545, and for deuterium it is even
smaller: 3671/3670, or 1.0002725. The energies of spectroscopic lines for
deuterium and light-hydrogen (hydrogen-1) therefore differ by the ratios of
these two numbers, which is 1.000272. The wavelengths of all deuterium
spectroscopic lines are shorter than the corresponding lines of light
hydrogen, by a factor of 1.000272. In astronomical observation, this
corresponds to a blue Doppler shift of 0.000272 times the speed of light,
or 81.6 km/s.⁶

The differences are much more pronounced in vibrational spectroscopy such
as infrared spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy, and in rotational spectra
such as microwave spectroscopy because the reduced mass of the deuterium is
markedly higher than that of protium.

Deuterium and Big Bang nucleosynthesis

Main article: Big Bang nucleosynthesis

Deuterium is thought to have played an important role in setting the number
and ratios of the elements that were formed in the Big Bang. Combining
thermodynamics and the changes brought about by cosmic expansion, one can
calculate the fraction of protons and neutrons based on the temperature at
the point that the universe cooled enough to allow formation of nuclei.
This calculation indicates seven protons for every neutron at the beginning
of nucleogenesis, a ratio that would remain stable even after nucleogenesis
was over. This fraction was in favor of protons initially, primarily
because the lower mass of the proton favored their production. As the
universe expanded, it cooled. Free neutrons and protons are less stable
than helium nuclei, and the protons and neutrons had a strong energetic
reason to form helium-4. However, forming helium-4 requires the
intermediate step of forming deuterium.

Through much of the few minutes after the big bang during which
nucleosynthesis could have occurred, the temperature was high enough that
the mean energy per particle was greater than the binding energy of weakly
bound deuterium; therefore any deuterium that was formed was immediately
destroyed. This situation is known as the deuterium bottleneck. The
bottleneck delayed formation of any helium-4 until the universe became cool
enough to form deuterium (at about a temperature equivalent to 100 keV). At
this point, there was a sudden burst of element formation (first deuterium,
which immediately fused to helium). However, very shortly thereafter, at
twenty minutes after the Big Bang, the universe became too cool for any
further nuclear fusion and nucleosynthesis to occur. At this point, the
elemental abundances were nearly fixed, with the only change as some of the
radioactive products of big bang nucleosynthesis (such as tritium) decay.⁷
The deuterium bottleneck in the formation of helium, together with the lack
of stable ways for helium to combine with hydrogen or with itself (there
are no stable nuclei with mass numbers of five or eight) meant that
insignificant carbon, or any elements heavier than carbon, formed in the
Big Bang. These elements thus required formation in stars. At the same
time, the failure of much nucleogenesis during the Big Bang ensured that
there would be plenty of hydrogen in the later universe available to form
long-lived stars, such as our Sun.

Abundance

Deuterium occurs in trace amounts naturally as deuterium gas, written 2H₂
or D₂, but most natural occurrence in the universe is bonded with a typical
1H atom, a gas called hydrogen deuteride (HD or 1H2H).⁸

The existence of deuterium on Earth, elsewhere in the solar system (as
confirmed by planetary probes), and in the spectra of stars, is also an
important datum in cosmology. Gamma radiation from ordinary nuclear fusion
dissociates deuterium into protons and neutrons, and there are no known
natural processes other than the Big Bang nucleosynthesis, which might have
produced deuterium at anything close to the observed natural abundance of
deuterium (deuterium is produced by the rare cluster decay, and occasional
absorption of naturally occurring neutrons by light hydrogen, but these are
trivial sources). There is thought to be little deuterium in the interior
of the Sun and other stars, as at temperatures there nuclear fusion
reactions that consume deuterium happen much faster than the proton-proton
reaction that creates deuterium. However, deuterium persists in the outer
solar atmosphere at roughly the same concentration as in Jupiter, and this
has probably been unchanged since the origin of the Solar System. The
natural abundance of deuterium seems to be a very similar fraction of
hydrogen, wherever hydrogen is found, unless there are obvious processes at
work that concentrate it.

The existence of deuterium at a low but constant primordial fraction in all
hydrogen is another one of the arguments in favor of the Big Bang theory
over the Steady State theory of the universe. The observed ratios of
hydrogen to helium to deuterium in the universe are difficult to explain
except with a Big Bang model. It is estimated that the abundances of
deuterium have not evolved significantly since their production about 13.8
bya.⁹ Measurements of Milky Way galactic deuterium from ultraviolet
spectral analysis show a ratio of as much as 23 atoms of deuterium per
million hydrogen atoms in undisturbed gas clouds, which is only 15% below
the WMAP estimated primordial ratio of about 27 atoms per million from the
Big Bang. This has been interpreted to mean that less deuterium has been
destroyed in star formation in our galaxy than expected, or perhaps
deuterium has been replenished by a large in-fall of primordial hydrogen
from outside the galaxy.¹⁰ In space a few hundred light years from the Sun,
deuterium abundance is only 15 atoms per million, but this value is
presumably influenced by differential adsorption of deuterium onto carbon
dust grains in interstellar space.¹¹

The abundance of deuterium in the atmosphere of Jupiter has been directly
measured by the Galileo space probe as 26 atoms per million hydrogen atoms.
ISO-SWS observations find 22 atoms per million hydrogen atoms in Jupiter.¹²
and this abundance is thought to represent close to the primordial solar
system ratio.³ This is about 17% of the terrestrial deuterium-to-hydrogen
ratio of 156 deuterium atoms per million hydrogen atoms.

Cometary bodies such as Comet Hale Bopp and Halley's Comet have been
measured to contain relatively more deuterium (about 200 atoms D per
million hydrogens), ratios which are enriched with respect to the presumed
protosolar nebula ratio, probably due to heating, and which are similar to
the ratios found in Earth seawater. The recent measurement of deuterium
amounts of 161 atoms D per million hydrogen in Comet 103P/Hartley (a former
Kuiper belt object), a ratio almost exactly that in Earth's oceans,
emphasizes the theory that Earth's surface water may be largely
comet-derived.² ³ Most recently the deuterium/protium (D/H) ratio of
67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko as measured by Rosetta is about three times that
of earth water, a figure that is high.⁴ This has caused renewed interest in
suggestions that Earth's water may be partly of asteroidal origin.

Deuterium has also observed to be concentrated over the mean solar
abundance in other terrestrial planets, in particular Mars and Venus.

Production

Main article: Heavy water § Production

Deuterium is produced for industrial, scientific and military purposes, by
starting with ordinary water—a small fraction of which is
naturally-occurring heavy water—and then separating out the heavy water by
the Girdler sulfide process, distillation, or other methods.

In theory, deuterium for heavy water could be created in a nuclear reactor,
but separation from ordinary water is the cheapest bulk production process.

The world's leading supplier of deuterium was Atomic Energy of Canada
Limited, in Canada, until 1997, when the last heavy water plant was shut
down. Canada uses heavy water as a neutron moderator for the operation of
the CANDU reactor design.

Properties

Physical properties

The physical properties of deuterium compounds can exhibit significant
kinetic isotope effects and other physical and chemical property
differences from the hydrogen analogs. D₂O, for example, is more viscous
than H₂O.¹³ Chemically, there are differences in bond energy and length for
compounds of heavy hydrogen isotopes compared to normal hydrogen, which are
larger than the isotopic differences in any other element. Bonds involving
deuterium and tritium are somewhat stronger than the corresponding bonds in
hydrogen, and these differences are enough to cause significant changes in
biological reactions.

Deuterium can replace the normal hydrogen in water molecules to form heavy
water (D₂O), which is about 10.6% denser than normal water (so that ice
made from it sinks in ordinary water). Heavy water is slightly toxic in
eukaryotic animals, with 25% substitution of the body water causing cell
division problems and sterility, and 50% substitution causing death by
cytotoxic syndrome (bone marrow failure and gastrointestinal lining
failure). Prokaryotic organisms, however, can survive and grow in pure
heavy water, though they develop slowly.¹⁴ Despite this toxicity,
consumption of heavy water under normal circumstances does not pose a
health threat to humans. It is estimated that a 70 kg person might drink
4.8 liters of heavy water without serious consequences.¹⁵ Small doses of
heavy water (a few grams in humans, containing an amount of deuterium
comparable to that normally present in the body) are routinely used as
harmless metabolic tracers in humans and animals.

Quantum properties

The deuteron has spin +1 ("triplet") and is thus a boson. The NMR frequency
of deuterium is significantly different from common light hydrogen.
Infrared spectroscopy also easily differentiates many deuterated compounds,
due to the large difference in IR absorption frequency seen in the
vibration of a chemical bond containing deuterium, versus light hydrogen.
The two stable isotopes of hydrogen can also be distinguished by using mass
spectrometry.

The triplet deuteron nucleon is barely bound at EB = 2.23 MeV, so all the
higher energy states are not bound. The singlet deuteron is a virtual
state, with a negative binding energy of ~60 keV. There is no such stable
particle, but this virtual particle transiently exists during
neutron-proton inelastic scattering, accounting for the unusually large
neutron scattering cross-section of the proton.¹⁶

Nuclear properties (the deuteron)

Deuteron mass and radius

The nucleus of deuterium is called a deuteron. It has a mass of
2.013553212724(78) u¹⁷ The charge radius of the deuteron is 2.1402(28) fm¹⁸

Spin and energy

Deuterium is one of only five stable nuclides with an odd number of protons
and an odd number of neutrons. (2H, 6Li, 10B, 14N, 180mTa; also, the
long-lived radioactive nuclides 40K, 50V, 138La, 176Lu occur naturally.)
Most odd-odd nuclei are unstable with respect to beta decay, because the
decay products are even-even, and are therefore more strongly bound, due to
nuclear pairing effects. Deuterium, however, benefits from having its
proton and neutron coupled to a spin-1 state, which gives a stronger
nuclear attraction; the corresponding spin-1 state does not exist in the
two-neutron or two-proton system, due to the Pauli exclusion principle
which would require one or the other identical particle with the same spin
to have some other different quantum number, such as orbital angular
momentum. But orbital angular momentum of either particle gives a lower
binding energy for the system, primarily due to increasing distance of the
particles in the steep gradient of the nuclear force. In both cases, this
causes the diproton and dineutron nucleus to be unstable.

The proton and neutron making up deuterium can be dissociated through
neutral current interactions with neutrinos. The cross section for this
interaction is comparatively large, and deuterium was successfully used as
a neutrino target in the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory experiment.

Isospin singlet state of the deuteron

Due to the similarity in mass and nuclear properties between the proton and
neutron, they are sometimes considered as two symmetric types of the same
object, a nucleon. While only the proton has an electric charge, this is
often negligible due to the weakness of the electromagnetic interaction
relative to the strong nuclear interaction. The symmetry relating the
proton and neutron is known as isospin and denoted I (or sometimes T).

Isospin is an SU(2) symmetry, like ordinary spin, so is completely
analogous to it. The proton and neutron form an isospin doublet, with a
"down" state (↓) being a neutron, and an "up" state (↑) being a proton.

A pair of nucleons can either be in an antisymmetric state of isospin
called singlet, or in a symmetric state called triplet. In terms of the
"down" state and "up" state, the singlet is

\frac{1}{√(2)} \Big ( |↑↓\rangle - |↓↑\rangle \Big ).

This is a nucleus with one proton and one neutron, i.e. a deuterium
nucleus. The triplet is

\left ( \begin{array}{ll} |↑↑\rangle \frac{1}{√(2)} ( |↑↓\rangle +
|↓↑\rangle ) |↓↓\rangle \end{array} \right )

and thus consists of three types of nuclei, which are supposed to be
symmetric: a deuterium nucleus (actually a highly excited state of it), a
nucleus with two protons, and a nucleus with two neutrons. The latter two
nuclei are not stable or nearly stable, and therefore so is this type of
deuterium (meaning that it is indeed a highly excited state of deuterium).

Approximated wavefunction of the deuteron

The deuteron wavefunction must be antisymmetric if the isospin
representation is used (since a proton and a neutron are not identical
particles, the wavefunction need not be antisymmetric in general). Apart
from their isospin, the two nucleons also have spin and spatial
distributions of their wavefunction. The latter is symmetric if the
deuteron is symmetric under parity (i.e. have an "even" or "positive"
parity), and antisymmetric if the deuteron is antisymmetric under parity
(i.e. have an "odd" or "negative" parity). The parity is fully determined
by the total orbital angular momentum of the two nucleons: if it is even
then the parity is even (positive), and if it is odd then the parity is odd
(negative).

The deuteron, being an isospin singlet, is antisymmetric under nucleons
exchange due to isospin, and therefore must be symmetric under the double
exchange of their spin and location. Therefore it can be in either of the
following two different states:

- Symmetric spin and symmetric under parity. In this case, the exchange of
  the two nucleons will multiply the deuterium wavefunction by (−1) from
  isospin exchange, (+1) from spin exchange and (+1) from parity (location
  exchange), for a total of (−1) as needed for antisymmetry.
- Antisymmetric spin and antisymmetric under parity. In this case, the
  exchange of the two nucleons will multiply the deuterium wavefunction by
  (−1) from isospin exchange, (−1) from spin exchange and (−1) from parity
  (location exchange), again for a total of (−1) as needed for
  antisymmetry.

In the first case the deuteron is a spin triplet, so that its total spin s
is 1. It also has an even parity and therefore even orbital angular
momentum l ; The lower its orbital angular momentum, the lower its energy.
Therefore the lowest possible energy state has s = 1, l = 0.

In the second case the deuteron is a spin singlet, so that its total spin s
is 0. It also has an odd parity and therefore odd orbital angular momentum
l. Therefore the lowest possible energy state has s = 0, l = 1.

Since s = 1 gives a stronger nuclear attraction, the deuterium ground state
is in the s =1, l = 0 state.

The same considerations lead to the possible states of an isospin triplet
having s = 0, l = even or s = 1, l = odd. Thus the state of lowest energy
has s = 1, l = 1, higher than that of the isospin singlet.

The analysis just given is in fact only approximate, both because isospin
is not an exact symmetry, and more importantly because the strong nuclear
interaction between the two nucleons is related to angular momentum in
spin-orbit interaction that mixes different s and l states. That is, s and
l are not constant in time (they do not commute with the Hamiltonian), and
over time a state such as s = 1, l = 0 may become a state of s = 1, l = 2.
Parity is still constant in time so these do not mix with odd l states
(such as s = 0, l = 1). Therefore the quantum state of the deuterium is a
superposition (a linear combination) of the s = 1, l = 0 state and the s =
1, l = 2 state, even though the first component is much bigger. Since the
total angular momentum j is also a good quantum number (it is a constant in
time), both components must have the same j, and therefore j = 1. This is
the total spin of the deuterium nucleus.

To summarize, the deuterium nucleus is antisymmetric in terms of isospin,
and has spin 1 and even (+1) parity. The relative angular momentum of its
nucleons l is not well defined, and the deuteron is a superposition of
mostly l = 0 with some l = 2.

Magnetic and electric multipoles

In order to find theoretically the deuterium magnetic dipole moment µ, one
uses the formula for a nuclear magnetic moment

μ= {1\over (j+1)}\langle (l,s),j,m_j=j|\overrightarrow{μ}
·\overrightarrow{j} |(l,s),j,m_j=j\rangle

with

\overrightarrow{μ} = g^{(l)}\overrightarrow{l} + g^{(s)}\overrightarrow{s}

g(l) and g(s) are g-factors of the nucleons.

Since the proton and neutron have different values for g(l) and g(s), one
must separate their contributions. Each gets half of the deuterium orbital
angular momentum \overrightarrow{l} and spin \overrightarrow{s} . One
arrives at

μ= {1\over (j+1)}\langle (l,s),j,m_j=j|\left ({1\over
2}\overrightarrow{l}{g^{(l)}} _p + {1\over 2}\overrightarrow{s}
({g^{(s)}}_p + {g^{(s)}}_n)\right )·\overrightarrow{j}
|(l,s),j,m_j=j\rangle

where subscripts p and n stand for the proton and neutron, and g(l)ₙ = 0.

By using the same identities as here and using the value g(l)ₚ = 1 µ
N, we arrive at the following result, in nuclear magneton units

μ= {1\over 4 (j+1)}\left{({g^{(s)}}_p + {g^{(s)}}_n)\big (j(j+1) - l(l+1) +
s(s+1)\big ) + \big (j(j+1) + l(l+1) - s(s+1)\big )\right }

For the s = 1, l = 0 state (j = 1), we obtain

μ= {1\over 2}({g^{(s)}}ₚ ₊ {g^{(s)}}ₙ₎ ₌ ₀.879

For the s = 1, l = 2 state (j = 1), we obtain

μ= -{1\over 4}({g^{(s)}}_p + {g^{(s)}}_n) + {3\over 4} = 0.310

The measured value of the deuterium magnetic dipole moment, is 0.857 µ
N, which is 97.5% of the 0.879 µ
N value obtained by simply adding moments of the proton and neutron. This
suggests that the state of the deuterium is indeed to a good approximation
s = 1, l = 0 state, which occurs with both nucleons spinning in the same
direction, but their magnetic moments subtracting because of the neutron's
negative moment.

But the slightly lower experimental number than that which results from
simple addition of proton and (negative) neutron moments shows that
deuterium is actually a linear combination of mostly s = 1, l = 0 state
with a slight admixture of s = 1, l = 2 state.

The electric dipole is zero as usual.

The measured electric quadrupole of the deuterium is 0.2859 e·fm². While
the order of magnitude is reasonable, since the deuterium radius is of
order of 1 femtometer (see below) and its electric charge is e, the above
model does not suffice for its computation. More specifically, the electric
quadrupole does not get a contribution from the l =0 state (which is the
dominant one) and does get a contribution from a term mixing the l =0 and
the l =2 states, because the electric quadrupole operator does not commute
with angular momentum.

The latter contribution is dominant in the absence of a pure l = 0
contribution, but cannot be calculated without knowing the exact spatial
form of the nucleons wavefunction inside the deuterium.

Higher magnetic and electric multipole moments cannot be calculated by the
above model, for similar reasons.

Applications

Deuterium has a number of commercial and scientific uses. These include:

Nuclear reactors

Deuterium is used in heavy water moderated fission reactors, usually as
liquid D₂O, to slow neutrons without the high neutron absorption of
ordinary hydrogen.¹⁹ This is a common commercial use for larger amounts of
deuterium.

In research reactors, liquid D₂ is used in cold sources to moderate
neutrons to very low energies and wavelengths appropriate for scattering
experiments.

Experimentally, deuterium is the most common nuclide used in nuclear fusion
reactor designs, especially in combination with tritium, because of the
large reaction rate (or nuclear cross section) and high energy yield of the
D–T reaction. There is an even higher-yield D–3He fusion reaction, though
the breakeven point of D–3He is higher than that of most other fusion
reactions; together with the scarcity of 3He, this makes it implausible as
a practical power source until at least D–T and D–D fusion reactions have
been performed on a commercial scale. However, commercial nuclear fusion is
not yet an accomplished technology.

NMR spectroscopy

See also: Proton NMR and Deuterium NMR

Deuterium is most commonly used in hydrogen nuclear magnetic resonance
spectroscopy (proton NMR) in the following way. NMR ordinarily requires
compounds of interest to be analyzed as dissolved in solution. Because of
deuterium's nuclear spin properties which differ from the light hydrogen
usually present in organic molecules, NMR spectra of hydrogen/protium are
highly differentiable from that of deuterium, and in practice deuterium is
not "seen" by an NMR instrument tuned for light-hydrogen. Deuterated
solvents (including heavy water, but also compounds like deuterated
chloroform, CDCl₃) are therefore routinely used in NMR spectroscopy, in
order to allow only the light-hydrogen spectra of the compound of interest
to be measured, without solvent-signal interference.

Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy can also be used to obtain
information about the deteron's environment in isotopically labelled
samples (Deuterium NMR). For example, the flexibility in the tail, which is
a long hydrocarbon chains, in deuterium-labelled lipid molecules can be
quantified using solid state deuterium NMR.²⁰

Deuterium NMR spectra are especially informative in the solid state because
of its relatively small quadrupole moment in comparison with those of
bigger quadrupolar nuclei such as chlorine-35, for example.

Tracing

In chemistry, biochemistry and environmental sciences, deuterium is used as
a non-radioactive, stable isotopic tracer, for example, in the doubly
labeled water test. In chemical reactions and metabolic pathways, deuterium
behaves somewhat similarly to ordinary hydrogen (with a few chemical
differences, as noted). It can be distinguished from ordinary hydrogen most
easily by its mass, using mass spectrometry or infrared spectrometry.
Deuterium can be detected by femtosecond infrared spectroscopy, since the
mass difference drastically affects the frequency of molecular vibrations;
deuterium-carbon bond vibrations are found in locations free of other
signals.

Measurements of small variations in the natural abundances of deuterium,
along with those of the stable heavy oxygen isotopes ¹⁷O and ¹⁸O, are of
importance in hydrology, to trace the geographic origin of Earth's waters.
The heavy isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen in rainwater (so-called meteoric
water) are enriched as a function of the environmental temperature of the
region in which the precipitation falls (and thus enrichment is related to
mean latitude). The relative enrichment of the heavy isotopes in rainwater
(as referenced to mean ocean water), when plotted against temperature falls
predictably along a line called the global meteoric water line (GMWL). This
plot allows samples of precipitation-originated water to be identified
along with general information about the climate in which it originated.
Evaporative and other processes in bodies of water, and also ground water
processes, also differentially alter the ratios of heavy hydrogen and
oxygen isotopes in fresh and salt waters, in characteristic and often
regionally distinctive ways.²¹ The ratio of concentration of ²H to ¹H is
usually indicated with a delta as δ²H and the geographic patterns of these
values are plotted in maps termed as isoscapes. Stable isotope are
incorporated into plants and animals and an analysis of the ratios in a
migrant bird or insect can help suggest a rough guide to their origins.²²
²³

Contrast properties

Neutron scattering techniques particularly profit from availability of
deuterated samples: The H and D cross sections are very distinct and
different in sign, which allows contrast variation in such experiments.
Further, a nuisance problem of ordinary hydrogen is its large incoherent
neutron cross section, which is nil for D. The substitution of deuterium
atoms for hydrogen atoms thus reduces scattering noise.

Hydrogen is an important and major component in all materials of organic
chemistry and life science, but it barely interacts with X-rays. As
hydrogen (and deuterium) interact strongly with neutrons, neutron
scattering techniques, together with a modern deuteration facility,²⁴ fills
a niche in many studies of macromolecules in biology and many other areas.

Nuclear weapons

This is discussed below. It is notable that although most stars, including
the Sun, generate energy over most of their lives by fusing hydrogen into
heavier elements, such fusion of light hydrogen (protium) has never been
successful in the conditions attainable on Earth. Thus, all artificial
fusion, including the hydrogen fusion that occurs in so-called hydrogen
bombs, requires heavy hydrogen (either tritium or deuterium, or both) in
order for the process to work.

Drugs

Suggested neurological effects of natural abundance variation

The natural deuterium content of water has been suggested from preliminary
correlative epidemiology to influence the incidence of affective
disorder-related pathophysiology and major depression, which might be
mediated by the serotonergic mechanisms.²⁵

History

Suspicion of lighter element isotopes

The existence of nonradioactive isotopes of lighter elements had been
suspected in studies of neon as early as 1913, and proven by mass
spectrometry of light elements in 1920. The prevailing theory at the time,
however, was that the isotopes were due to the existence of differing
numbers of "nuclear electrons" in different atoms of an element. It was
expected that hydrogen, with a measured average atomic mass very close to 1
u, the known mass of the proton, always had a nucleus composed of a single
proton (a known particle), and therefore could not contain any nuclear
electrons without losing its charge entirely. Thus, hydrogen could have no
heavy isotopes.

Deuterium detected

It was first detected spectroscopically in late 1931 by Harold Urey, a
chemist at Columbia University. Urey's collaborator, Ferdinand Brickwedde,
distilled five liters of cryogenically produced liquid hydrogen to 1 mL of
liquid, using the low-temperature physics laboratory that had recently been
established at the National Bureau of Standards in Washington, D.C. (now
the National Institute of Standards and Technology). The technique had
previously been used to isolate heavy isotopes of neon. The cryogenic
boiloff technique concentrated the fraction of the mass-2 isotope of
hydrogen to a degree that made its spectroscopic identification
unambiguous.²⁶ ²⁷

Naming of the isotope and Nobel Prize

Urey created the names protium, deuterium, and tritium in an article
published in 1934. The name is based in part on advice from G. N. Lewis who
had proposed the name "deutium". The name is derived from the Greek
deuteros (second), and the nucleus to be called "deuteron" or "deuton".
Isotopes and new elements were traditionally given the name that their
discoverer decided. Some British chemists, like Ernest Rutherford, wanted
the isotope to be called "diplogen", from the Greek diploos (double), and
the nucleus to be called diplon.¹

The amount inferred for normal abundance of this heavy isotope of hydrogen
was so small (only about 1 atom in 6400 hydrogen atoms in ocean water (156
deuteriums per million hydrogens)) that it had not noticeably affected
previous measurements of (average) hydrogen atomic mass. This explained why
it hadn't been experimentally suspected before. Urey was able to
concentrate water to show partial enrichment of deuterium. Lewis had
prepared the first samples of pure heavy water in 1933. The discovery of
deuterium, coming before the discovery of the neutron in 1932, was an
experimental shock to theory, but when the neutron was reported, making
deuterium's existence more explainable, deuterium won Urey the Nobel Prize
in chemistry in 1934. Lewis was embittered by being passed over for this
recognition given to his former student.¹

"Heavy water" experiments in World War II

Main article: Heavy water

Shortly before the war, Hans von Halban and Lew Kowarski moved their
research on neutron moderation from France to England, smuggling the entire
global supply of heavy water (which had been made in Norway) across in
twenty-six steel drums.²⁸ ²⁹

During World War II, Nazi Germany was known to be conducting experiments
using heavy water as moderator for a nuclear reactor design. Such
experiments were a source of concern because they might allow them to
produce plutonium for an atomic bomb. Ultimately it led to the Allied
operation called the "Norwegian heavy water sabotage", the purpose of which
was to destroy the Vemork deuterium production/enrichment facility in
Norway. At the time this was considered important to the potential progress
of the war.

After World War II ended, the Allies discovered that Germany was not
putting as much serious effort into the program as had been previously
thought. They had been unable to sustain a chain reaction. The Germans had
completed only a small, partly built experimental reactor (which had been
hidden away). By the end of the war, the Germans did not even have a fifth
of the amount of heavy water needed to run the reactor, partially due to
the Norwegian heavy water sabotage operation. However, even had the Germans
succeeded in getting a reactor operational (as the U.S. did with a graphite
reactor in late 1942), they would still have been at least several years
away from development of an atomic bomb with maximal effort. The
engineering process, even with maximal effort and funding, required about
two and a half years (from first critical reactor to bomb) in both the U.S.
and U.S.S.R, for example.

Deuterium in thermonuclear weapons

Main articles: Teller-Ulam design and thermonuclear weapon

The 62-ton Ivy Mike device built by the United States and exploded on 1
November 1952, was the first fully successful "hydrogen bomb" or
thermonuclear bomb. In this context, it was the first bomb in which most of
the energy released came from nuclear reaction stages that followed the
primary nuclear fission stage of the atomic bomb. The Ivy Mike bomb was a
factory-like building, rather than a deliverable weapon. At its center, a
very large cylindrical, insulated vacuum flask or cryostat, held cryogenic
liquid deuterium in a volume of about 1000 liters (160 kilograms in mass,
if this volume had been completely filled). Then, a conventional atomic
bomb (the "primary") at one end of the bomb was used to create the
conditions of extreme temperature and pressure that were needed to set off
the thermonuclear reaction.

Within a few years, so-called "dry" hydrogen bombs were developed that did
not need cryogenic hydrogen. Released information suggests that all
thermonuclear weapons built since then contain chemical compounds of
deuterium and lithium in their secondary stages. The material that contains
the deuterium is mostly lithium deuteride, with the lithium consisting of
the isotope lithium-6. When the lithium-6 is bombarded with fast neutrons
from the atomic bomb, tritium (hydrogen-3) is produced, and then the
deuterium and the tritium quickly engage in thermonuclear fusion, releasing
abundant energy, helium-4, and even more free neutrons.

Anti-deuterium

An antideuteron is the antimatter counterpart of the nucleus of deuterium,
consisting of an antiproton and an antineutron. The antideuteron was first
produced in 1965 at the Proton Synchrotron at CERN³⁰ and the Alternating
Gradient Synchrotron at Brookhaven National Laboratory.³¹ A complete atom,
with a positron orbiting the nucleus, would be called antideuterium, but as
of 2005 antideuterium has not yet been created. The proposed symbol for
antideuterium is D, that is, D with an overbar.³²

Earth

This article is about the planet. For other uses, see Earth
(disambiguation).

Earth (also the world[n 5], in Greek: Gaia,[n 6] or in Latin: Terra²⁶ ), is
the third planet from the Sun, the densest planet in the Solar System, the
largest of the Solar System's four terrestrial planets, and the only
astronomical object known to accommodate life. The earliest life on Earth
arose at least 3.5 billion years ago.²⁷ ²⁸ ²⁹ Earth's biodiversity has
expanded continually except when interrupted by mass extinctions.³⁰
Although scholars estimate that over 99 percent of all species of life
(over five billion)³¹ that ever lived on Earth are extinct,³² ³³ there are
still an estimated 10–14 million extant species,³⁴ ³⁵ of which about 1.2
million have been documented and over 86 percent have not yet been
described.³⁶ Over 7.3 billion humans³⁷ live on Earth and depend on its
biosphere and minerals for their survival. Earth's human population is
divided among about two hundred sovereign states which interact through
diplomacy, conflict, travel, trade and communication media.

According to evidence from radiometric dating and other sources, Earth was
formed about 4.54 billion years ago.³⁸ ³⁹ ⁴⁰ Within its first billion
years,⁴¹ life appeared in its oceans and began to affect its atmosphere and
surface, promoting the proliferation of aerobic as well as anaerobic
organisms and causing the formation of the atmosphere's ozone layer. This
layer blocks the most life-threatening parts of the Sun's radiation,
enabling life to flourish on land as well as in water.⁴² Since then, the
combination of Earth's distance from the Sun, its physical properties and
its geological history have allowed life to thrive and evolve.

Earth's lithosphere is divided into several rigid tectonic plates that
migrate across the surface over periods of many millions of years.
Seventy-one percent of Earth's surface is covered with water,⁴³ with the
remainder consisting of continents and islands that together have many
lakes and other sources of water that contribute to the hydrosphere.
Earth's polar regions are mostly covered with ice, including the Antarctic
ice sheet and the sea ice of the polar ice packs. Earth's interior remains
active with a solid iron inner core, a liquid outer core that generates the
magnetic field, and a convecting mantle that drives plate tectonics.

Earth gravitationally interacts with other objects in space, especially the
Sun and the Moon. During one orbit around the Sun, Earth rotates about its
own axis 366.26 times, creating 365.26 solar days or one sidereal year.[n
7] Earth's axis of rotation is tilted 23.4° away from the perpendicular of
its orbital plane, producing seasonal variations on the planet's surface
with a period of one tropical year (365.24 solar days).⁴⁴ The Moon is
Earth's only permanent natural satellite. Its gravitational interaction
with Earth causes ocean tides, stabilizes the orientation of Earth's
rotational axis, and gradually slows Earth's rotational rate.

Chronology

Formation

Main article: History of Earth

The earliest material found in the Solar System is dated to 4.5672±0.0006
billion years ago (Gya).⁴⁵ By 4.54±0.04 Gya⁴¹ the primordial Earth had
formed. The formation and evolution of the Solar System bodies occurred
along with those of the Sun. In theory, a solar nebula partitions a volume
out of a molecular cloud by gravitational collapse, which begins to spin
and flatten into a circumstellar disk, and then the planets grow out of
that along with the Sun. A nebula contains gas, ice grains, and dust
(including primordial nuclides). In nebular theory, planetesimals form by
accretion. The assembly of the primordial Earth proceeded for 10–20 Ma.⁴⁶

The process that led to the formation of the Moon approximately 4.53
billion years ago⁴⁷ is the subject of ongoing research. The working
hypothesis is that it formed by accretion from material loosed from Earth
after a Mars-sized object, named Theia, impacted with Earth.⁴⁸ In this
scenario, the mass of Theia was 10% of that of Earth,⁴⁹ it impacted Earth
with a glancing blow,⁵⁰ and some of its mass merged with Earth. Between
approximately 4.1 and 3.8 Gya, numerous asteroid impacts during the Late
Heavy Bombardment caused significant changes to the greater surface
environment of the Moon, and by inference, to Earth.

Geological history

Main article: Geological history of Earth

Earth's atmosphere and oceans formed by volcanic activity and outgassing
that included water vapor. The origin of the world's oceans was
condensation augmented by water and ice delivered by asteroids,
protoplanets, and comets.⁵¹ In this model, atmospheric "greenhouse gases"
kept the oceans from freezing when the newly forming Sun had only 70% of
its current luminosity.⁵² By 3.5 Gya, Earth's magnetic field was
established, which helped prevent the atmosphere from being stripped away
by the solar wind.⁵³ A crust formed when the molten outer layer of Earth
cooled to form a solid as the accumulated water vapor began to act in the
atmosphere. The two models⁵⁴ that explain land mass propose either a steady
growth to the present-day forms⁵⁵ or, more likely, a rapid growth⁵⁶ early
in Earth history⁵⁷ followed by a long-term steady continental area.⁵⁸ ⁵⁹ ⁶⁰
Continents formed by plate tectonics, a process ultimately driven by the
continuous loss of heat from Earth's interior. On time scales lasting
hundreds of millions of years, the supercontinents have formed and broken
up three times. Roughly 750 mya (million years ago), one of the earliest
known supercontinents, Rodinia, began to break apart. The continents later
recombined to form Pannotia, 600–540 mya, then finally Pangaea, which also
broke apart 180 mya.⁶¹

The present pattern of ice ages began about 40 mya and then intensified
during the Pleistocene about 3 mya. High-latitude regions have since
undergone repeated cycles of glaciation and thaw, repeating every 40–100000
years. The last continental glaciation ended 10,000 years ago.⁶²

Evolution of life

Main article: Evolutionary history of life

Highly energetic chemical reactions are thought to have produced
self–replicating molecules around four billion years ago. This was followed
a half billion years later by the last common ancestor of all life.⁶³ The
development of photosynthesis allowed the Sun's energy to be harvested
directly by life forms; the resultant molecular oxygen (O₂) accumulated in
the atmosphere and due to interaction with ultraviolet solar radiation,
formed a layer of protective ozone (O₃) in the upper atmosphere.⁶⁴ The
incorporation of smaller cells within larger ones resulted in the
development of complex cells called eukaryotes.⁶⁵ True multicellular
organisms formed as cells within colonies became increasingly specialized.
Aided by the absorption of harmful ultraviolet radiation by the ozone
layer, life colonized Earth's surface.⁶⁶ The earliest fossil evidence for
life is biogenic graphite found in 3.7 billion-year-old metasedimentary
rocks in Western Greenland⁶⁷ and microbial mat fossils found in 3.48
billion-year-old sandstone in Western Australia.⁶⁸ ⁶⁹

Since the 1960s, it has been hypothesized that severe glacial action
between 750 and 580 mya, during the Neoproterozoic, covered much of Earth
in ice. This hypothesis has been termed "Snowball Earth", and it is of
particular interest because it preceded the Cambrian explosion, when
multicellular life forms began to proliferate.⁷⁰

Following the Cambrian explosion, about 535 mya, there have been five major
mass extinctions.⁷¹ The most recent such event was 66 mya, when an asteroid
impact triggered the extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs and other large
reptiles, but spared some small animals such as mammals, which then
resembled shrews. Over the past 66 Ma, mammalian life has diversified, and
several million years ago an African ape-like animal such as Orrorin
tugenensis gained the ability to stand upright.⁷² This facilitated tool use
and encouraged communication that provided the nutrition and stimulation
needed for a larger brain, which allowed the evolution of the human race.
The development of agriculture, and then civilization, led to humans having
an influence on Earth and the nature and quantity of other life forms as no
other species ever has.⁷³

Predicted future

Main article: Future of the Earth
See also: Global catastrophic risk

Estimates on how much longer Earth will be able to continue to support life
range from 500 million years (Myr), to as long as 2.3 billion years
(Gyr).⁷⁴ ⁷⁵ ⁷⁶ Earth's long-term future is closely tied to that of the Sun.
As a result of the steady accumulation of helium at the Sun's core, the
Sun's total luminosity will slowly increase. The luminosity of the Sun will
grow by 10% over the next 1.1 Ga and by 40% over the next 3.5 Ga.⁷⁷ Climate
models indicate that the rise in radiation reaching Earth is likely to have
dire consequences, including the loss of the oceans.⁷⁸

Earth's increasing surface temperature will accelerate the inorganic CO₂
cycle, reducing its concentration to levels lethally low for plants (10 ppm
for C4 photosynthesis) in approximately 500–900 Ma.⁷⁴ The lack of
vegetation will result in the loss of oxygen in the atmosphere, so animal
life will become extinct within several million more years.⁷⁹ After another
billion years all surface water will have disappeared⁷⁵ and the mean global
temperature will reach 70 °C⁷⁹ (158 °F). Earth is expected to be
effectively habitable for about another 500 Ma from that point,⁷⁴ although
this may be extended up to 2.3 Ga if the nitrogen is removed from the
atmosphere.⁷⁶ Even if the Sun were eternal and stable, 27% of the water in
the modern oceans will descend to the mantle in one billion years, due to
reduced steam venting from mid-ocean ridges.⁸⁰

The Sun will evolve to become a red giant in about 5 Ga. Models predict
that the Sun will expand to roughly 1 AU (150,000,000 km), which is about
250 times its present radius.⁷⁷ ⁸¹ Earth's fate is less clear. As a red
giant, the Sun will lose roughly 30% of its mass, so, without tidal
effects, Earth will move to an orbit 1.7 AU (250,000,000 km) from the Sun
when it reaches its maximum radius. Earth was, therefore, once expected to
escape envelopment by the expanded Sun's outer atmosphere, though most, if
not all, remaining life would have been destroyed by the Sun's increased
luminosity (peaking at about 5,000 times its present level).⁷⁷ A 2008
simulation indicates that Earth's orbit will decay due to tidal effects and
drag, causing it to enter the red giant Sun's atmosphere and be
vaporized.⁸¹

Name and etymology

The modern English word Earth developed from a wide variety of Middle
English forms,[n 8] which derived from an Old English noun most often
spelled eorðe.⁸² It has cognates in every Germanic language, and their
proto-Germanic root has been reconstructed as *erþō. In its earliest
appearances, eorðe was already being used to translate the many senses of
Latin terra and Greek γῆ (gē): the ground,[n 9] its soil,[n 10] dry land,[n
11] the human world,[n 12] the surface of the world (including the sea),[n
13] and the globe itself.[n 14] As with Terra and Gaia, Earth was a
personified goddess in Germanic paganism: the Angles were listed by Tacitus
as among the devotees of Nerthus,⁹¹ and later Norse mythology included
Jörð, a giantess often given as the mother of Thor.⁹²

Originally, earth was written in lowercase, and from early Middle English,
its definite sense as "the globe" was expressed as the earth. By early
Modern English, many nouns were capitalized, and the earth became (and
often remained) the Earth, particularly when referenced along with other
heavenly bodies. More recently, the name is sometimes simply given as
Earth, by analogy with the names of the other planets.⁸² House styles now
vary: Oxford spelling recognizes the lowercase form as the most common,
with the capitalized form an acceptable variant. Another convention
capitalizes "Earth" when appearing as a name (e.g. "Earth's atmosphere")
but writes it in lowercase when preceded by the (e.g. "the atmosphere of
the earth"). It almost always appears in lowercase in colloquial
expressions such as "what on earth are you doing?"⁹³

Composition and structure

Shape

Main article: Figure of the Earth
World map color-coded by relative height

The shape of Earth approximates an oblate spheroid, a sphere flattened
along the axis from pole to pole such that there is a bulge around the
equator.⁹⁵ This bulge results from the rotation of Earth, and causes the
diameter at the equator to be 43 kilometres (27 mi) larger than the
pole-to-pole diameter.⁹⁶ Thus the point on the surface farthest from
Earth's center of mass is the summit of the equatorial Chimborazo volcano
in Ecuador.⁹⁴ ⁹⁷ ⁹⁸ ⁹⁹ The average diameter of the reference spheroid is
about 12,742 kilometres (7,918 mi), which is approximately 40,000 km/π,
because the meter was originally defined as 1/10,000,000 of the distance
from the equator to the North Pole through Paris, France.¹⁰⁰

Local topography deviates from this idealized spheroid, although on a
global scale these deviations are small compared to Earth's radius: The
maximum deviation of only 0.17% is at the Mariana Trench (10,911 metres
(35,797 ft) below local sea level), whereas Mount Everest (8,848 metres
(29,029 ft) above local sea level) represents a deviation of 0.14%. If
Earth were shrunk to the size of a cue ball, some areas of Earth such as
mountain ranges and oceanic trenches would feel like small imperfections,
whereas much of the planet, including the Great Plains and the abyssal
plains, would actually feel smoother than a cue ball.¹⁰¹

Chemical composition

See also: Abundance of elements on Earth

Earth's mass is approximately 5.97×10²⁴ kg (5,970 yg). It is composed
mostly of iron (32.1%), oxygen (30.1%), silicon (15.1%), magnesium (13.9%),
sulfur (2.9%), nickel (1.8%), calcium (1.5%), and aluminium (1.4%), with
the remaining 1.2% consisting of trace amounts of other elements. Due to
mass segregation, the core region is estimated to be primarily composed of
iron (88.8%), with smaller amounts of nickel (5.8%), sulfur (4.5%), and
less than 1% trace elements.¹⁰³

The geochemist F. W. Clarke calculated that a little more than 47% of
Earth's crust consists of oxygen. The more common rock constituents of the
crust are nearly all oxides: chlorine, sulfur and fluorine are the
important exceptions to this and their total amount in any rock is usually
much less than 1%. The principal oxides are silica, alumina, iron oxides,
lime, magnesia, potash and soda. The silica functions principally as an
acid, forming silicates, and all the most common minerals of igneous rocks
are of this nature. From a computation based on 1,672 analyses of all kinds
of rocks, Clarke deduced that 99.22% was composed of 11 oxides (see the
table at right), with the other constituents occurring in minute
quantities.¹⁰⁴

Internal structure

Main article: Structure of the Earth

Earth's interior, like that of the other terrestrial planets, is divided
into layers by their chemical or physical (rheological) properties, but
unlike the other terrestrial planets, it has a distinct outer and inner
core. The outer layer is a chemically distinct silicate solid crust, which
is underlain by a highly viscous solid mantle. The crust is separated from
the mantle by the Mohorovičić discontinuity, and the thickness of the crust
varies: averaging 6 km (kilometers) under the oceans and 30–50 km on the
continents. The crust and the cold, rigid, top of the upper mantle are
collectively known as the lithosphere, and it is of the lithosphere that
the tectonic plates are composed. Beneath the lithosphere is the
asthenosphere, a relatively low-viscosity layer on which the lithosphere
rides. Important changes in crystal structure within the mantle occur at
410 and 660 km below the surface, spanning a transition zone that separates
the upper and lower mantle. Beneath the mantle, an extremely low viscosity
liquid outer core lies above a solid inner core.¹⁰⁵ The inner core may
rotate at a slightly higher angular velocity than the remainder of the
planet, advancing by 0.1–0.5° per year.¹⁰⁶ The radius of the inner core is
about one fifth of Earth's.

Heat

Main article: Earth's internal heat budget

Earth's internal heat comes from a combination of residual heat from
planetary accretion (about 20%) and heat produced through radioactive decay
(80%).¹⁰⁹ The major heat-producing isotopes within Earth are potassium-40,
uranium-238, uranium-235, and thorium-232.¹¹⁰ At the center, the
temperature may be up to 6,000 °C (10,830 °F),¹¹¹ and the pressure could
reach 360 GPa.¹¹² Because much of the heat is provided by radioactive
decay, scientists postulate that early in Earth's history, before isotopes
with short half-lives had been depleted, Earth's heat production would have
been much higher. This extra heat production, twice present-day at
approximately 3 Ga,¹⁰⁹ would have increased temperature gradients with
radius, increasing the rates of mantle convection and plate tectonics, and
allowing the production of uncommon igneous rocks such as komatiites that
are rarely formed today.¹¹³

The mean heat loss from Earth is 87 mW m−2, for a global heat loss of 4.42
× 10¹³ W.¹¹⁵ A portion of the core's thermal energy is transported toward
the crust by mantle plumes; a form of convection consisting of upwellings
of higher-temperature rock. These plumes can produce hotspots and flood
basalts.¹¹⁶ More of the heat in Earth is lost through plate tectonics, by
mantle upwelling associated with mid-ocean ridges. The final major mode of
heat loss is through conduction through the lithosphere, the majority of
which occurs under the oceans because the crust there is much thinner than
that of the continents.¹¹⁷

Tectonic plates

Main article: Plate tectonics

The mechanically rigid outer layer of Earth, the lithosphere, is broken
into pieces called tectonic plates. These plates are rigid segments that
move in relation to one another at one of three types of plate boundaries:
convergent boundaries, at which two plates come together, divergent
boundaries, at which two plates are pulled apart, and transform boundaries,
in which two plates slide past one another laterally. Earthquakes, volcanic
activity, mountain-building, and oceanic trench formation can occur along
these plate boundaries.¹¹⁹ The tectonic plates ride on top of the
asthenosphere, the solid but less-viscous part of the upper mantle that can
flow and move along with the plates.¹²⁰

As the tectonic plates migrate across the planet, the ocean floor is
subducted under the leading edges of the plates at convergent boundaries.
At the same time, the upwelling of mantle material at divergent boundaries
creates mid-ocean ridges. The combination of these processes continually
recycles the oceanic crust back into the mantle. Due to this recycling,
most of the ocean floor is less than 100 Ma old in age. The oldest oceanic
crust is located in the Western Pacific, and has an estimated age of about
200 Ma.¹²¹ ¹²² By comparison, the oldest dated continental crust is 4030
Ma.¹²³

The seven major plates are the Pacific, North American, Eurasian, African,
Antarctic, Indo-Australian, and South American. Other notable plates
include the Arabian Plate, the Caribbean Plate, the Nazca Plate off the
west coast of South America and the Scotia Plate in the southern Atlantic
Ocean. The Australian Plate fused with the Indian Plate between 50 and 55
mya. The fastest-moving plates are the oceanic plates, with the Cocos Plate
advancing at a rate of 75 mm/year¹²⁴ and the Pacific Plate moving 52–69
mm/year. At the other extreme, the slowest-moving plate is the Eurasian
Plate, progressing at a typical rate of about 21 mm/year.¹²⁵

Surface

Main articles: Lithosphere, Landform and Extreme points of Earth

Features of Earth's solid surface shown as percentages of the planet's
total surface area

Oceanic ridges (22.1%)
Ocean basin floors (29.8%)
Continental mountains (10.3%)
Continental lowlands (18.9%)
Continental shelves and slopes (11.4%)
Continental rise (3.8%)
Volcanic island arcs, trenches, submarine volcanoes, and hills (3.7%)

Earth's terrain varies greatly from place to place. About 70.8%¹³ of the
surface is covered by water, with much of the continental shelf below sea
level. This equates to 361.132 million km² (139.43 million sq mi).¹²⁶ The
submerged surface has mountainous features, including a globe-spanning
mid-ocean ridge system, as well as undersea volcanoes,⁹⁶ oceanic trenches,
submarine canyons, oceanic plateaus and abyssal plains. The remaining 29.2%
(148.94 million km², or 57.51 million sq mi) not covered by water consists
of mountains, deserts, plains, plateaus, and other landforms.

The planetary surface undergoes reshaping over geological time periods due
to tectonics and erosion. The surface features built up or deformed through
plate tectonics are subject to steady weathering and erosion from
precipitation, thermal cycles, and chemical effects. Glaciation, coastal
erosion, the build-up of coral reefs, and large meteorite impacts¹²⁷ also
act to reshape the landscape.

The continental crust consists of lower density material such as the
igneous rocks granite and andesite. Less common is basalt, a denser
volcanic rock that is the primary constituent of the ocean floors.¹²⁸
Sedimentary rock is formed from the accumulation of sediment that becomes
buried and compacted together. Nearly 75% of the continental surfaces are
covered by sedimentary rocks, although they form about 5% of the crust.¹²⁹
The third form of rock material found on Earth is metamorphic rock, which
is created from the transformation of pre-existing rock types through high
pressures, high temperatures, or both. The most abundant silicate minerals
on Earth's surface include quartz, feldspars, amphibole, mica, pyroxene and
olivine.¹³⁰ Common carbonate minerals include calcite (found in limestone)
and dolomite.¹³¹

The pedosphere is the outermost layer of Earth's continental surface and is
composed of soil and subject to soil formation processes. It exists at the
interface of the lithosphere, atmosphere, hydrosphere and biosphere. The
total arable land is 13.31% of the land surface, with 4.71% supporting
permanent crops.¹⁴ Close to 40% of Earth's land surface is used for
cropland and pasture, or an estimated 1.3×10⁷ km² of cropland and 3.4×10⁷
km² of pastureland.¹³²

The elevation of the land surface varies from the low point of −418 m at
the Dead Sea, to a 2005-estimated maximum altitude of 8,848 m at the top of
Mount Everest. The mean height of land above sea level is 840 m.¹³³

Besides being divided logically into Northern and Southern hemispheres
centered on the poles, Earth has been divided arbitrarily into Eastern and
Western hemispheres. Earth's surface is traditionally divided into seven
continents and various seas.

Hydrosphere

Main article: Hydrosphere

The abundance of water on Earth's surface is a unique feature that
distinguishes the "Blue Planet" from other planets in the Solar System.
Earth's hydrosphere consists chiefly of the oceans, but technically
includes all water surfaces in the world, including inland seas, lakes,
rivers, and underground waters down to a depth of 2,000 m. The deepest
underwater location is Challenger Deep of the Mariana Trench in the Pacific
Ocean with a depth of 10,911.4 m.[n 18]¹³⁴

The mass of the oceans is approximately 1.35×10¹⁸ metric tons, or about
1/4400 of Earth's total mass. The oceans cover an area of 3.618×10⁸ km²
with a mean depth of 3682 m, resulting in an estimated volume of 1.332×10⁹
km³.¹³⁵ If all of Earth's crustal surface was at the same elevation as a
smooth sphere, the depth of the resulting world ocean would be 2.7 to 2.8
km.¹³⁶ ¹³⁷

About 97.5% of the water is saline; the remaining 2.5% is fresh water. Most
fresh water, about 68.7%, is present as ice in ice caps and glaciers.¹³⁸

The average salinity of Earth's oceans is about 35 grams of salt per
kilogram of sea water (3.5% salt).¹³⁹ Most of this salt was released from
volcanic activity or extracted from cool igneous rocks.¹⁴⁰ The oceans are
also a reservoir of dissolved atmospheric gases, which are essential for
the survival of many aquatic life forms.¹⁴¹ Sea water has an important
influence on the world's climate, with the oceans acting as a large heat
reservoir.¹⁴² Shifts in the oceanic temperature distribution can cause
significant weather shifts, such as the El Niño-Southern Oscillation.¹⁴³

Atmosphere

Main article: Atmosphere of Earth

The atmospheric pressure on Earth's surface averages 101.325 kPa, with a
scale height of about 8.5 km.³ It has a composition of 78% nitrogen and 21%
oxygen, with trace amounts of water vapor, carbon dioxide and other gaseous
molecules. The height of the troposphere varies with latitude, ranging
between 8 km at the poles to 17 km at the equator, with some variation
resulting from weather and seasonal factors.¹⁴⁴

Earth's biosphere has significantly altered its atmosphere. Oxygenic
photosynthesis evolved 2.7 Gya, forming the primarily nitrogen–oxygen
atmosphere of today.⁶⁴ This change enabled the proliferation of aerobic
organisms as well as the formation of the ozone layer, which blocks
ultraviolet solar radiation, permitting life on land. Other atmospheric
functions important to life include transporting water vapor, providing
useful gases, causing small meteors to burn up before they strike the
surface, and moderating temperature.¹⁴⁵ This last phenomenon is known as
the greenhouse effect: trace molecules within the atmosphere serve to
capture thermal energy emitted from the ground, thereby raising the average
temperature. Water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane and ozone are the primary
greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Without this heat-retention effect, the
average surface would be −18 °C, in contrast to the current +15 °C, and
life would likely not exist.¹⁴⁶

Weather and climate

Main articles: Weather and Climate

Earth's atmosphere has no definite boundary, slowly becoming thinner and
fading into outer space. Three-quarters of the atmosphere's mass is
contained within the first 11 km of the surface. This lowest layer is
called the troposphere. Energy from the Sun heats this layer, and the
surface below, causing expansion of the air. This lower-density air then
rises, and is replaced by cooler, higher-density air. The result is
atmospheric circulation that drives the weather and climate through
redistribution of thermal energy.¹⁴⁷

The primary atmospheric circulation bands consist of the trade winds in the
equatorial region below 30° latitude and the westerlies in the
mid-latitudes between 30° and 60°.¹⁴⁸ Ocean currents are also important
factors in determining climate, particularly the thermohaline circulation
that distributes thermal energy from the equatorial oceans to the polar
regions.¹⁴⁹

Water vapor generated through surface evaporation is transported by
circulatory patterns in the atmosphere. When atmospheric conditions permit
an uplift of warm, humid air, this water condenses and falls to the surface
as precipitation.¹⁴⁷ Most of the water is then transported to lower
elevations by river systems and usually returned to the oceans or deposited
into lakes. This water cycle is a vital mechanism for supporting life on
land, and is a primary factor in the erosion of surface features over
geological periods. Precipitation patterns vary widely, ranging from
several meters of water per year to less than a millimeter. Atmospheric
circulation, topographic features and temperature differences determine the
average precipitation that falls in each region.¹⁵⁰

The amount of solar energy reaching Earth's surface decreases with
increasing latitude. At higher latitudes the sunlight reaches the surface
at lower angles and it must pass through thicker columns of the atmosphere.
As a result, the mean annual air temperature at sea level decreases by
about 0.4 °C (0.7 °F) per degree of latitude from the equator.¹⁵¹ Earth's
surface can be subdivided into specific latitudinal belts of approximately
homogeneous climate. Ranging from the equator to the polar regions, these
are the tropical (or equatorial), subtropical, temperate and polar
climates.¹⁵² Climate can also be classified based on the temperature and
precipitation, with the climate regions characterized by fairly uniform air
masses. The commonly used Köppen climate classification system (as modified
by Wladimir Köppen's student Rudolph Geiger) has five broad groups (humid
tropics, arid, humid middle latitudes, continental and cold polar), which
are further divided into more specific subtypes.¹⁴⁸

Climate on Earth has latitudinal anomalies, namely the habitability of the
Scandinavian peninsula very far north in sharp contrast to the polar
climates of northern Canada as well as the cool summers expected at low
latitudes in the Southern Hemisphere (for example on the west coast of
South America). Another anomaly is the impact of landmass on temperature,
manifested by the fact that Earth is much warmer at aphelion, where the
planet is at a more distant position from the Sun.¹⁵³ When the Northern
hemisphere is turned towards the sunlight even the increased distance to it
does not hinder temperatures to be 2.3 °C (4 °F) warmer than at
perihelion—when the marine southern hemisphere is turned towards the
Sun.¹⁵³

At high latitudes, the western sides of continents tend to be milder than
the eastern sides—for example seen in North America and Western Europe
where rough continental climates appear on the east coast on parallels with
mild climates on the other side of the ocean.¹⁵⁴

The highest air temperature ever measured on Earth was 56.7 °C (134.1 °F)
in Furnace Creek, California, in Death Valley, in 1913.¹⁵⁵ The lowest air
temperature ever directly measured on Earth was −89.2 °C (−128.6 °F) at
Vostok Station in 1983,¹⁵⁶ but satellites have used remote sensing to
measure temperatures as low as −94.7 °C (−138.5 °F) in East Antarctica.¹⁵⁷
These temperature records are only measurements made with modern
instruments from the 20th century onwards and likely do not reflect the
full range of temperature on Earth.

Upper atmosphere

Above the troposphere, the atmosphere is usually divided into the
stratosphere, mesosphere, and thermosphere.¹⁴⁵ Each layer has a different
lapse rate, defining the rate of change in temperature with height. Beyond
these, the exosphere thins out into the magnetosphere, where the
geomagnetic fields interact with the solar wind.¹⁵⁸ Within the stratosphere
is the ozone layer, a component that partially shields the surface from
ultraviolet light and thus is important for life on Earth. The Kármán line,
defined as 100 km above Earth's surface, is a working definition for the
boundary between the atmosphere and outer space.¹⁵⁹

Thermal energy causes some of the molecules at the outer edge of the
atmosphere to increase their velocity to the point where they can escape
from Earth's gravity. This causes a slow but steady leakage of the
atmosphere into space. Because unfixed hydrogen has a low molecular mass,
it can achieve escape velocity more readily and it leaks into outer space
at a greater rate than other gases.¹⁶⁰ The leakage of hydrogen into space
contributes to the shifting of Earth's atmosphere and surface from an
initially reducing state to its current oxidizing one. Photosynthesis
provided a source of free oxygen, but the loss of reducing agents such as
hydrogen is thought to have been a necessary precondition for the
widespread accumulation of oxygen in the atmosphere.¹⁶¹ Hence the ability
of hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere may have influenced the nature of
life that developed on Earth.¹⁶² In the current, oxygen-rich atmosphere
most hydrogen is converted into water before it has an opportunity to
escape. Instead, most of the hydrogen loss comes from the destruction of
methane in the upper atmosphere.¹⁶³

Magnetic field

Main article: Earth's magnetic field

The main part of Earth's magnetic field is generated in the core, the site
of a dynamo process that converts kinetic energy of fluid convective motion
into electrical and magnetic field energy. The field extends outwards from
the core, through the mantle, and up to Earth's surface, where it is, to
rough approximation, a dipole. The poles of the dipole are located close to
Earth's geographic poles. At the equator of the magnetic field, the
magnetic-field strength at the surface is 3.05 × 10−5 T, with global
magnetic dipole moment of 7.91 × 10¹⁵ T m³.¹⁶⁴ The convection movements in
the core are chaotic; the magnetic poles drift and periodically change
alignment. This causes field reversals at irregular intervals averaging a
few times every million years. The most recent reversal occurred
approximately 700,000 years ago.¹⁶⁵ ¹⁶⁶

Magnetosphere

The extent of Earth's magnetic field in space defines the magnetosphere.
Ions and electrons of the solar wind are deflected by the magnetosphere;
solar wind pressure compresses the dayside of the magnetosphere, to about
10 Earth radii, and extends the nightside magnetosphere into a long tail.
Because the velocity of the solar wind is greater than the speed at which
wave propagate through the solar wind, a supersonic bowshock precedes the
dayside magnetosphere within the solar wind. Charged particles are
contained within the magnetosphere; the plasmasphere is defined by
low-energy particles that essentially follow magnetic field lines as Earth
rotates; the ring current is defined by medium-energy particles that drift
relative to the geomagnetic field, but with paths that are still dominated
by the magnetic field, and the Van Allen radiation belt are formed by
high-energy particles whose motion is essentially random, but otherwise
contained by the magnetosphere.

During a magnetic storm, charged particles can be deflected from the outer
magnetosphere, directed along field lines into Earth's ionosphere, where
atmospheric atoms can be excited and ionized, causing the aurora.¹⁶⁷

Orbit and rotation

Rotation

Main article: Earth's rotation

Earth's rotation period relative to the Sun—its mean solar day—is 86,400
seconds of mean solar time (86,400.0025 SI seconds).¹⁶⁸ Because Earth's
solar day is now slightly longer than it was during the 19th century due to
tidal deceleration, each day varies between 0 and 2 SI ms longer.¹⁶⁹ ¹⁷⁰

Earth's rotation period relative to the fixed stars, called its stellar day
by the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service (IERS),
is 86,164.098903691 seconds of mean solar time (UT1), or 23h 56m
4.098903691s.² [n 19] Earth's rotation period relative to the precessing or
moving mean vernal equinox, misnamed its sidereal day, is
86,164.09053083288 seconds of mean solar time (UT1) (23h 56m
4.09053083288s) as of 1982.² Thus the sidereal day is shorter than the
stellar day by about 8.4 ms.¹⁷¹ The length of the mean solar day in SI
seconds is available from the IERS for the periods 1623–2005¹⁷² and
1962–2005.¹⁷³

Apart from meteors within the atmosphere and low-orbiting satellites, the
main apparent motion of celestial bodies in Earth's sky is to the west at a
rate of 15°/h = 15'/min. For bodies near the celestial equator, this is
equivalent to an apparent diameter of the Sun or the Moon every two
minutes; from Earth's surface, the apparent sizes of the Sun and the Moon
are approximately the same.¹⁷⁴ ¹⁷⁵

Orbit

Main article: Earth's orbit

Earth orbits the Sun at an average distance of about 150 million kilometers
every 365.2564 mean solar days, or one sidereal year. This gives an
apparent movement of the Sun eastward with respect to the stars at a rate
of about 1°/day, which is one apparent Sun or Moon diameter every 12 hours.
Due to this motion, on average it takes 24 hours—a solar day—for Earth to
complete a full rotation about its axis so that the Sun returns to the
meridian. The orbital speed of Earth averages about 29.8 km/s (107,000
km/h), which is fast enough to travel a distance equal to Earth's diameter,
about 12,742 km, in seven minutes, and the distance to the Moon, 384,000
km, in about 3.5 hours.³

The Moon and Earth orbit a common barycenter every 27.32 days relative to
the background stars. When combined with the Earth–Moon system's common
orbit around the Sun, the period of the synodic month, from new moon to new
moon, is 29.53 days. Viewed from the celestial north pole, the motion of
Earth, the Moon, and their axial rotations are all counterclockwise. Viewed
from a vantage point above the north poles of both the Sun and Earth, Earth
orbits in a counterclockwise direction about the Sun. The orbital and axial
planes are not precisely aligned: Earth's axis is tilted some 23.4 degrees
from the perpendicular to the Earth–Sun plane (the ecliptic), and the
Earth–Moon plane is tilted up to ±5.1 degrees against the Earth–Sun plane.
Without this tilt, there would be an eclipse every two weeks, alternating
between lunar eclipses and solar eclipses.³ ¹⁷⁶

The Hill sphere, or gravitational sphere of influence, of Earth is about
1.5 Gm or 1,500,000 km in radius.¹⁷⁷ [n 20] This is the maximum distance at
which the Earth's gravitational influence is stronger than the more distant
Sun and planets. Objects must orbit Earth within this radius, or they can
become unbound by the gravitational perturbation of the Sun.

Earth, along with the Solar System, is situated in the Milky Way and orbits
about 28,000 light years from its center. It is about 20 light years above
the galactic plane in the Orion Arm.¹⁷⁸

Axial tilt and seasons

Main article: Axial tilt § Earth

Due to Earth's axial tilt, the amount of sunlight reaching any given point
on the surface varies over the course of the year. This causes seasonal
change in climate, with summer in the northern hemisphere occurring when
the North Pole is pointing toward the Sun, and winter taking place when the
pole is pointed away. During the summer, the day lasts longer and the Sun
climbs higher in the sky. In winter, the climate becomes generally cooler
and the days shorter. In northern temperate latitudes, the Sun rises north
of true east during the summer solstice, and sets north of true west,
reversing in the winter. The Sun rises south of true east in the summer for
the southern temperate zone, and sets south of true west.

Above the Arctic Circle, an extreme case is reached where there is no
daylight at all for part of the year, up to six months at the North Pole
itself, a polar night. In the southern hemisphere the situation is exactly
reversed, with the South Pole oriented opposite the direction of the North
Pole. Six months later, this pole will experience a midnight sun, a day of
24 hours, again reversing with the South Pole.

By astronomical convention, the four seasons are determined by the
solstices—the point in the orbit of maximum axial tilt toward or away from
the Sun—and the equinoxes, when the direction of the tilt and the direction
to the Sun are perpendicular. In the northern hemisphere, winter solstice
occurs on about December 21, summer solstice is near June 21, spring
equinox is around March 20 and autumnal equinox is about September 23. In
the southern hemisphere, the situation is reversed, with the summer and
winter solstices exchanged and the spring and autumnal equinox dates
swapped.¹⁷⁹

The angle of Earth's axial tilt is relatively stable over long periods of
time. Its axial tilt does undergo nutation; a slight, irregular motion with
a main period of 18.6 years.¹⁸⁰ The orientation (rather than the angle) of
Earth's axis also changes over time, precessing around in a complete circle
over each 25,800 year cycle; this precession is the reason for the
difference between a sidereal year and a tropical year. Both of these
motions are caused by the varying attraction of the Sun and the Moon on
Earth's equatorial bulge. The poles also migrate a few meters across
Earth's surface. This polar motion has multiple, cyclical components, which
collectively are termed quasiperiodic motion. In addition to an annual
component to this motion, there is a 14-month cycle called the Chandler
wobble. Earth's rotational velocity also varies in a phenomenon known as
length-of-day variation.¹⁸¹

In modern times, Earth's perihelion occurs around January 3, and its
aphelion around July 4. These dates change over time due to precession and
other orbital factors, which follow cyclical patterns known as Milankovitch
cycles. The changing Earth–Sun distance causes an increase of about 6.9%[n
21] in solar energy reaching Earth at perihelion relative to aphelion.
Because the southern hemisphere is tilted toward the Sun at about the same
time that Earth reaches the closest approach to the Sun, the southern
hemisphere receives slightly more energy from the Sun than does the
northern over the course of a year. This effect is much less significant
than the total energy change due to the axial tilt, and most of the excess
energy is absorbed by the higher proportion of water in the southern
hemisphere.¹⁸²

Habitability

A planet that can sustain life is termed habitable, even if life did not
originate there. Earth provides liquid water—an environment where complex
organic molecules can assemble and interact, and sufficient energy to
sustain metabolism.¹⁸³ The distance of Earth from the Sun, as well as its
orbital eccentricity, rate of rotation, axial tilt, geological history,
sustaining atmosphere and protective magnetic field all contribute to the
current climatic conditions at the surface.¹⁸⁴

Biosphere

Main article: Biosphere

A planet's life forms inhabit ecosystems, whose total is sometimes said to
form a "biosphere". Earth's biosphere is thought to have begun evolving
about 3.5 Gya.⁶⁴ The biosphere is divided into a number of biomes,
inhabited by broadly similar plants and animals. On land, biomes are
separated primarily by differences in latitude, height above sea level and
humidity. Terrestrial biomes lying within the Arctic or Antarctic Circles,
at high altitudes or in extremely arid areas are relatively barren of plant
and animal life; species diversity reaches a peak in humid lowlands at
equatorial latitudes.¹⁸⁵

Natural resources and land use

Main articles: Natural resource and Land use

Earth has resources that have been exploited by humans. Those termed
non-renewable resources, such as fossil fuels, only renew over geological
timescales.

Large deposits of fossil fuels are obtained from Earth's crust, consisting
of coal, petroleum, and natural gas. These deposits are used by humans both
for energy production and as feedstock for chemical production. Mineral ore
bodies have also been formed within the crust through a process of ore
genesis, resulting from actions of magmatism, erosion and plate
tectonics.¹⁸⁷ These bodies form concentrated sources for many metals and
other useful elements.

Earth's biosphere produces many useful biological products for humans,
including food, wood, pharmaceuticals, oxygen, and the recycling of many
organic wastes. The land-based ecosystem depends upon topsoil and fresh
water, and the oceanic ecosystem depends upon dissolved nutrients washed
down from the land.¹⁸⁸ In 1980, 5,053 Mha (50.53 million km²) of Earth's
land surface consisted of forest and woodlands, 6,788 Mha (67.88 million
km²) was grasslands and pasture, and 1,501 Mha (15.01 million km²) was
cultivated as croplands.¹⁸⁹ The estimated amount of irrigated land in 1993
was 2,481,250 square kilometres (958,020 sq mi).¹⁴ Humans also live on the
land by using building materials to construct shelters.

Natural and environmental hazards

Large areas of Earth's surface are subject to extreme weather such as
tropical cyclones, hurricanes, or typhoons that dominate life in those
areas. From 1980 to 2000, these events caused an average of 11,800 human
deaths per year.¹⁹⁰ Many places are subject to earthquakes, landslides,
tsunamis, volcanic eruptions, tornadoes, sinkholes, blizzards, floods,
droughts, wildfires, and other calamities and disasters.

Many localized areas are subject to human-made pollution of the air and
water, acid rain and toxic substances, loss of vegetation (overgrazing,
deforestation, desertification), loss of wildlife, species extinction, soil
degradation, soil depletion and erosion.

According to the United Nations, a scientific consensus exists linking
human activities to global warming due to industrial carbon dioxide
emissions. This is predicted to produce changes such as the melting of
glaciers and ice sheets, more extreme temperature ranges, significant
changes in weather and a global rise in average sea levels.¹⁹¹

Human geography

Main articles: Human geography and World

Cartography, the study and practice of map-making, and geography, the study
of the lands, features, inhabitants and phenomena on Earth, have
historically been the disciplines devoted to depicting Earth. Surveying,
the determination of locations and distances, and to a lesser extent
navigation, the determination of position and direction, have developed
alongside cartography and geography, providing and suitably quantifying the
requisite information.

Earth's human population reached approximately seven billion on October 31,
2011.¹⁹² Projections indicate that the world's human population will reach
9.2 billion in 2050.¹⁹³ Most of the growth is expected to take place in
developing nations. Human population density varies widely around the
world, but a majority live in Asia. By 2020, 60% of the world's population
is expected to be living in urban, rather than rural, areas.¹⁹⁴

It is estimated that one-eighth of Earth's surface is suitable for humans
to live on – three-quarters of Earth's surface is covered by oceans,
leaving one quarter as land. Half of that land area is desert (14%),¹⁹⁵
high mountains (27%),¹⁹⁶ or other unsuitable terrain. The northernmost
permanent settlement in the world is Alert, on Ellesmere Island in Nunavut,
Canada.¹⁹⁷ (82°28′N) The southernmost is the Amundsen–Scott South Pole
Station, in Antarctica, almost exactly at the South Pole. (90°S)

Independent sovereign nations claim the planet's entire land surface,
except for some parts of Antarctica, a few land parcels along the Danube
river's western bank, and the odd unclaimed area of Bir Tawil between Egypt
and Sudan. As of 2015, there are 193 sovereign states that are member
states of the United Nations, plus two observer states and 72 dependent
territories and states with limited recognition.¹⁴ Historically, Earth has
never had a sovereign government with authority over the entire globe
although a number of nation-states have striven for world domination and
failed.¹⁹⁸

The United Nations is a worldwide intergovernmental organization that was
created with the goal of intervening in the disputes between nations,
thereby avoiding armed conflict.¹⁹⁹ The U.N. serves primarily as a forum
for international diplomacy and international law. When the consensus of
the membership permits, it provides a mechanism for armed intervention.²⁰⁰

The first human to orbit Earth was Yuri Gagarin on April 12, 1961.²⁰¹ In
total, about 487 people have visited outer space and reached orbit as of 30
July 2010, and, of these, twelve have walked on the Moon.²⁰² ²⁰³ ²⁰⁴
Normally, the only humans in space are those on the International Space
Station. The station's crew, made up of six people, is usually replaced
every six months.²⁰⁵ The farthest that humans have travelled from Earth is
400,171 km, achieved during the Apollo 13 mission in 1970.²⁰⁶

Moon

Main article: Moon
Full moon as seen from Earth's Northern Hemisphere
Details of the Earth–Moon system, showing the radius of each object and the
Earth–Moon barycenter. The Moon's axis is located by Cassini's third law.

The Moon is a relatively large, terrestrial, planet-like satellite, with a
diameter about one-quarter of Earth's. It is the largest moon in the Solar
System relative to the size of its planet, although Charon is larger
relative to the dwarf planet Pluto. The natural satellites of other planets
are also referred to as "moons", after Earth's.

The gravitational attraction between Earth and the Moon causes tides on
Earth. The same effect on the Moon has led to its tidal locking: its
rotation period is the same as the time it takes to orbit Earth. As a
result, it always presents the same face to the planet. As the Moon orbits
Earth, different parts of its face are illuminated by the Sun, leading to
the lunar phases; the dark part of the face is separated from the light
part by the solar terminator.

Due to their tidal interaction, the Moon recedes from Earth at the rate of
approximately 38 mm/yr. Over millions of years, these tiny
modifications—and the lengthening of Earth's day by about 23 µs/yr—add up
to significant changes.²⁰⁷ During the Devonian period, for example,
(approximately 410 mya) there were 400 days in a year, with each day
lasting 21.8 hours.²⁰⁸

The Moon may have dramatically affected the development of life by
moderating the planet's climate. Paleontological evidence and computer
simulations show that Earth's axial tilt is stabilized by tidal
interactions with the Moon.²⁰⁹ Some theorists think that without this
stabilization against the torques applied by the Sun and planets to Earth's
equatorial bulge, the rotational axis might be chaotically unstable,
exhibiting chaotic changes over millions of years, as appears to be the
case for Mars.²¹⁰

Viewed from Earth, the Moon is just far enough away to have almost the same
apparent-sized disk as the Sun. The angular size (or solid angle) of these
two bodies match because, although the Sun's diameter is about 400 times as
large as the Moon's, it is also 400 times more distant.¹⁷⁵ This allows
total and annular solar eclipses to occur on Earth.

The most widely accepted theory of the Moon's origin, the giant impact
theory, states that it formed from the collision of a Mars-size protoplanet
called Theia with the early Earth. This hypothesis explains (among other
things) the Moon's relative lack of iron and volatile elements, and the
fact that its composition is nearly identical to that of Earth's crust.²¹¹

Asteroids and artificial satellites

Earth has at least five co-orbital asteroids, including 3753 Cruithne and
2002 AA29.²¹² ²¹³ A trojan asteroid companion, 2010 TK7, is librating
around the leading Lagrange triangular point, L4, in the Earth's orbit
around the Sun.²¹⁴ ²¹⁵

The tiny near-Earth asteroid 2006 RH120 makes close approaches to the
Earth–Moon system roughly every twenty years. During these approaches, it
can orbit Earth for brief periods of time.²¹⁶

As of March 2015, there were 1,265 operational, human-made satellites
orbiting Earth.²¹⁷ There are also inoperative satellites, including
Vanguard 1 the oldest satellite currently in orbit, and over 300,000 pieces
of space debris. Earth's largest artificial satellite is the International
Space Station.

Cultural and historical viewpoint

Main article: Earth in culture

The standard astronomical symbol of Earth consists of a cross circumscribed
by a circle, ,²¹⁸ representing the four quadrants of the world.

Human cultures have developed many views of the planet. Earth is sometimes
personified as a deity. In many cultures it is a mother goddess that is
also the primary fertility deity,²¹⁹ and by the mid-20th century the Gaia
Principle compared Earth's environments and life as a single
self-regulating organism leading to broad stabilization of the conditions
of habitability.²²⁰ ²²¹ ²²² Creation myths in many religions involve the
creation of Earth by a supernatural deity or deities.²¹⁹

Scientific investigation has resulted in several culturally transformative
shifts in our view of the planet. In the West, belief in a flat Earth²²³
was displaced by the idea of spherical Earth, credited to Pythagoras in the
6th century BC.²²⁴ Earth was further believed to be the center of the
universe until the 16th century, when scientists first theorized that it
was a moving object, comparable to the other planets in the Solar
System.²²⁵ Due to the efforts of influential Christian scholars and clerics
such as James Ussher, who sought to determine the age of Earth through
analysis of genealogies in Scripture, Westerners prior to the 19th century
generally believed Earth to be a few thousand years old at most. It was
only during the 19th century that geologists realized Earth's age was at
least many millions of years.²²⁶ Lord Kelvin used thermodynamics to
estimate the age of Earth to be between 20 million and 400 million years in
1864, sparking a vigorous debate on the subject; it was only when
radioactivity and radioactive dating were discovered in the late 19th and
early 20th centuries that a reliable mechanism for determining Earth's age
was established, proving the planet to be billions of years old.²²⁷ ²²⁸ The
perception of Earth shifted again in the 20th century when humans first
viewed it from orbit, and especially with photographs of Earth returned by
the Apollo program.²²⁹

Electric charge

Electric charge is the physical property of matter that causes it to
experience a force when placed in an electromagnetic field. There are two
types of electric charges: positive and negative. Positively charged
substances are repelled from other positively charged substances, but
attracted to negatively charged substances; negatively charged substances
are repelled from negative and attracted to positive. An object is
negatively charged if it has an excess of electrons, and is otherwise
positively charged or uncharged. The SI derived unit of electric charge is
the coulomb (C), although in electrical engineering it is also common to
use the ampere-hour (Ah), and in chemistry it is common to use the
elementary charge (e) as a unit. The symbol Q is often used to denote
charge. The early knowledge of how charged substances interact is now
called classical electrodynamics, and is still very accurate if quantum
effects do not need to be considered.

The electric charge is a fundamental conserved property of some subatomic
particles, which determines their electromagnetic interaction. Electrically
charged matter is influenced by, and produces, electromagnetic fields. The
interaction between a moving charge and an electromagnetic field is the
source of the electromagnetic force, which is one of the four fundamental
forces (See also: magnetic field).

Twentieth-century experiments demonstrated that electric charge is
quantized; that is, it comes in integer multiples of individual small units
called the elementary charge, e, approximately equal to 1.602×10−19
coulombs (except for particles called quarks, which have charges that are
integer multiples of e/3). The proton has a charge of +e, and the electron
has a charge of −e. The study of charged particles, and how their
interactions are mediated by photons, is called quantum electrodynamics.

Overview

Charge is the fundamental property of forms of matter that exhibit
electrostatic attraction or repulsion in the presence of other matter.
Electric charge is a characteristic property of many subatomic particles.
The charges of free-standing particles are integer multiples of the
elementary charge e; we say that electric charge is quantized. Michael
Faraday, in his electrolysis experiments, was the first to note the
discrete nature of electric charge. Robert Millikan's oil-drop experiment
demonstrated this fact directly, and measured the elementary charge.

By convention, the charge of an electron is −1, while that of a proton is
+1. Charged particles whose charges have the same sign repel one another,
and particles whose charges have different signs attract. Coulomb's law
quantifies the electrostatic force between two particles by asserting that
the force is proportional to the product of their charges, and inversely
proportional to the square of the distance between them.

The charge of an antiparticle equals that of the corresponding particle,
but with opposite sign. Quarks have fractional charges of either −¹⁄₃ or
+²⁄₃, but free-standing quarks have never been observed (the theoretical
reason for this fact is asymptotic freedom).

The electric charge of a macroscopic object is the sum of the electric
charges of the particles that make it up. This charge is often small,
because matter is made of atoms, and atoms typically have equal numbers of
protons and electrons, in which case their charges cancel out, yielding a
net charge of zero, thus making the atom neutral.

An ion is an atom (or group of atoms) that has lost one or more electrons,
giving it a net positive charge (cation), or that has gained one or more
electrons, giving it a net negative charge (anion). Monatomic ions are
formed from single atoms, while polyatomic ions are formed from two or more
atoms that have been bonded together, in each case yielding an ion with a
positive or negative net charge.

Electric field induced by a positive electric charge (left) and a field
induced by a negative electric charge (right).

During formation of macroscopic objects, constituent atoms and ions usually
combine to form structures composed of neutral ionic compounds electrically
bound to neutral atoms. Thus macroscopic objects tend toward being neutral
overall, but macroscopic objects are rarely perfectly net neutral.

Sometimes macroscopic objects contain ions distributed throughout the
material, rigidly bound in place, giving an overall net positive or
negative charge to the object. Also, macroscopic objects made of conductive
elements, can more or less easily (depending on the element) take on or
give off electrons, and then maintain a net negative or positive charge
indefinitely. When the net electric charge of an object is non-zero and
motionless, the phenomenon is known as static electricity. This can easily
be produced by rubbing two dissimilar materials together, such as rubbing
amber with fur or glass with silk. In this way non-conductive materials can
be charged to a significant degree, either positively or negatively. Charge
taken from one material is moved to the other material, leaving an opposite
charge of the same magnitude behind. The law of conservation of charge
always applies, giving the object from which a negative charge has been
taken a positive charge of the same magnitude, and vice versa.

Even when an object's net charge is zero, charge can be distributed
non-uniformly in the object (e.g., due to an external electromagnetic
field, or bound polar molecules). In such cases the object is said to be
polarized. The charge due to polarization is known as bound charge, while
charge on an object produced by electrons gained or lost from outside the
object is called free charge. The motion of electrons in conductive metals
in a specific direction is known as electric current.

Units

The SI unit of quantity of electric charge is the coulomb, which is
equivalent to about 6.242×10¹⁸ e (e is the charge of a proton). Hence, the
charge of an electron is approximately −1.602×10−19 C. The coulomb is
defined as the quantity of charge that has passed through the cross section
of an electrical conductor carrying one ampere within one second. The
symbol Q is often used to denote a quantity of electricity or charge. The
quantity of electric charge can be directly measured with an electrometer,
or indirectly measured with a ballistic galvanometer.

After finding the quantized character of charge, in 1891 George Stoney
proposed the unit 'electron' for this fundamental unit of electrical
charge. This was before the discovery of the particle by J.J. Thomson in
1897. The unit is today treated as nameless, referred to as "elementary
charge", "fundamental unit of charge", or simply as "e". A measure of
charge should be a multiple of the elementary charge e, even if at large
scales charge seems to behave as a real quantity. In some contexts it is
meaningful to speak of fractions of a charge; for example in the charging
of a capacitor, or in the fractional quantum Hall effect.

In systems of units other than SI such as cgs, electric charge is expressed
as combination of only three fundamental quantities such as length, mass
and time and not four as in SI where electric charge is a combination of
length, mass, time and electric current.

History

As reported by the ancient Greek mathematician Thales of Miletus around 600
BC, charge (or electricity) could be accumulated by rubbing fur on various
substances, such as amber. The Greeks noted that the charged amber buttons
could attract light objects such as hair. They also noted that if they
rubbed the amber for long enough, they could even get an electric spark to
jump. This property derives from the triboelectric effect.

In 1600, the English scientist William Gilbert returned to the subject in
De Magnete, and coined the New Latin word electricus from ηλεκτρον
(elektron), the Greek word for amber, which soon gave rise to the English
words "electric" and "electricity." He was followed in 1660 by Otto von
Guericke, who invented what was probably the first electrostatic generator.
Other European pioneers were Robert Boyle, who in 1675 stated that electric
attraction and repulsion can act across a vacuum; Stephen Gray, who in 1729
classified materials as conductors and insulators; and C. F. du Fay, who
proposed in 1733¹ that electricity comes in two varieties that cancel each
other, and expressed this in terms of a two-fluid theory. When glass was
rubbed with silk, du Fay said that the glass was charged with vitreous
electricity, and, when amber was rubbed with fur, the amber was said to be
charged with resinous electricity. In 1839, Michael Faraday showed that the
apparent division between static electricity, current electricity, and
bioelectricity was incorrect, and all were a consequence of the behavior of
a single kind of electricity appearing in opposite polarities. It is
arbitrary which polarity is called positive and which is called negative.
Positive charge can be defined as the charge left on a glass rod after
being rubbed with silk.²

One of the foremost experts on electricity in the 18th century was Benjamin
Franklin, who argued in favour of a one-fluid theory of electricity.
Franklin imagined electricity as being a type of invisible fluid present in
all matter; for example, he believed that it was the glass in a Leyden jar
that held the accumulated charge. He posited that rubbing insulating
surfaces together caused this fluid to change location, and that a flow of
this fluid constitutes an electric current. He also posited that when
matter contained too little of the fluid it was "negatively" charged, and
when it had an excess it was "positively" charged. For a reason that was
not recorded, he identified the term "positive" with vitreous electricity
and "negative" with resinous electricity. William Watson arrived at the
same explanation at about the same time.

Static electricity and electric current

Static electricity and electric current are two separate phenomena. They
both involve electric charge, and may occur simultaneously in the same
object. Static electricity refers to the electric charge of an object and
the related electrostatic discharge when two objects are brought together
that are not at equilibrium. An electrostatic discharge creates a change in
the charge of each of the two objects. In contrast, electric current is the
flow of electric charge through an object, which produces no net loss or
gain of electric charge.

Electrification by friction

Further information: triboelectric effect

When a piece of glass and a piece of resin—neither of which exhibit any
electrical properties—are rubbed together and left with the rubbed surfaces
in contact, they still exhibit no electrical properties. When separated,
they attract each other.

A second piece of glass rubbed with a second piece of resin, then separated
and suspended near the former pieces of glass and resin causes these
phenomena:

- The two pieces of glass repel each other.
- Each piece of glass attracts each piece of resin.
- The two pieces of resin repel each other.

This attraction and repulsion is an electrical phenomena, and the bodies
that exhibit them are said to be electrified, or electrically charged.
Bodies may be electrified in many other ways, as well as by friction. The
electrical properties of the two pieces of glass are similar to each other
but opposite to those of the two pieces of resin: The glass attracts what
the resin repels and repels what the resin attracts.

If a body electrified in any manner whatsoever behaves as the glass does,
that is, if it repels the glass and attracts the resin, the body is said to
be 'vitreously' electrified, and if it attracts the glass and repels the
resin it is said to be 'resinously' electrified. All electrified bodies are
found to be either vitreously or resinously electrified.

It is the established convention of the scientific community to define the
vitreous electrification as positive, and the resinous electrification as
negative. The exactly opposite properties of the two kinds of
electrification justify our indicating them by opposite signs, but the
application of the positive sign to one rather than to the other kind must
be considered as a matter of arbitrary convention, just as it is a matter
of convention in mathematical diagram to reckon positive distances towards
the right hand.

No force, either of attraction or of repulsion, can be observed between an
electrified body and a body not electrified.³

Actually, all bodies are electrified, but may appear not to be so by the
relative similar charge of neighboring objects in the environment. An
object further electrified + or – creates an equivalent or opposite charge
by default in neighboring objects, until those charges can equalize. The
effects of attraction can be observed in high-voltage experiments, while
lower voltage effects are merely weaker and therefore less obvious. The
attraction and repulsion forces are codified by Coulomb's Law (attraction
falls off at the square of the distance, which has a corollary for
acceleration in a gravitational field, suggesting that gravitation may be
merely electrostatic phenomenon between relatively weak charges in terms of
scale). See also the Casimir effect.

It is now known that the Franklin/Watson model was fundamentally correct.
There is only one kind of electrical charge, and only one variable is
required to keep track of the amount of charge.⁴ On the other hand, just
knowing the charge is not a complete description of the situation. Matter
is composed of several kinds of electrically charged particles, and these
particles have many properties, not just charge.

The most common charge carriers are the positively charged proton and the
negatively charged electron. The movement of any of these charged particles
constitutes an electric current. In many situations, it suffices to speak
of the conventional current without regard to whether it is carried by
positive charges moving in the direction of the conventional current or by
negative charges moving in the opposite direction. This macroscopic
viewpoint is an approximation that simplifies electromagnetic concepts and
calculations.

At the opposite extreme, if one looks at the microscopic situation, one
sees there are many ways of carrying an electric current, including: a flow
of electrons; a flow of electron "holes" that act like positive particles;
and both negative and positive particles (ions or other charged particles)
flowing in opposite directions in an electrolytic solution or a plasma.

Beware that, in the common and important case of metallic wires, the
direction of the conventional current is opposite to the drift velocity of
the actual charge carriers, i.e., the electrons. This is a source of
confusion for beginners.

Properties

Aside from the properties described in articles about electromagnetism,
charge is a relativistic invariant. This means that any particle that has
charge Q, no matter how fast it goes, always has charge Q. This property
has been experimentally verified by showing that the charge of one helium
nucleus (two protons and two neutrons bound together in a nucleus and
moving around at high speeds) is the same as two deuterium nuclei (one
proton and one neutron bound together, but moving much more slowly than
they would if they were in a helium nucleus).

Conservation of electric charge

Main article: Charge conservation

The total electric charge of an isolated system remains constant regardless
of changes within the system itself. This law is inherent to all processes
known to physics and can be derived in a local form from gauge invariance
of the wave function. The conservation of charge results in the
charge-current continuity equation. More generally, the net change in
charge density ρ within a volume of integration V is equal to the area
integral over the current density J through the closed surface S = ∂V,
which is in turn equal to the net current I:

  - \frac{d}{dt} ∫_V ρ \mathrm{d} V = \partial VJ ·\mathrm{d} S = ∫J dS
  \cos θ= I.

Thus, the conservation of electric charge, as expressed by the continuity
equation, gives the result:

I = \frac{dQ}{dt} .

The charge transferred between times t_i and t_f is obtained by integrating
both sides:

Q = ∫_{t_{\mathrm{i} }}^{t_{\mathrm{f} }} I \mathrm{d} t

where I is the net outward current through a closed surface and Q is the
electric charge contained within the volume defined by the surface.

Electric field

The electric field is a component of the electromagnetic field. It is a
vector field, and it is generated by electric charges or time-varying
magnetic fields as described by Maxwell's equations.¹ The concept of an
electric field was introduced by Michael Faraday.²

Definition

The electric field E at a given point is defined as the (vectorial) force F
that would be exerted on a stationary test particle of unit charge by
electromagnetic forces (i.e. the Lorentz force). A particle of charge q
would be subject to a force F=q·E.

Its SI units are newtons per coulomb (N⋅C−1) or, equivalently, volts per
metre (V⋅m−1), which in terms of SI base units are kg⋅m⋅s−3⋅A−1.

Sources of electric field

Causes and description

Electric fields are caused by electric charges or varying magnetic fields.
The former effect is described by Gauss's law, the latter by Faraday's law
of induction, which together are enough to define the behavior of the
electric field as a function of charge repartition and magnetic field.
However, since the magnetic field is described as a function of electric
field, the equations of both fields are coupled and together form Maxwell's
equations that describe both fields as a function of charges and currents.

In the special case of a steady state (stationary charges and currents),
the Maxwell-Faraday inductive effect disappears. The resulting two
equations (Gauss's law \nabla ·E = \frac{ρ}{ε₀} and Faraday's law with no
induction term \nabla \times E = 0), taken together, are equivalent to
Coulomb's law, written as \boldsymbol{E} (\boldsymbol{r} ) = {1\over
4πε_0}∫d\boldsymbol{r'} ρ(\boldsymbol{r'} ) {\boldsymbol{r} -
\boldsymbol{r'} \over |\boldsymbol{r} - \boldsymbol{r'} |³} for a charge
densityρ(r) (r denotes the position in space). Notice that ε₀, the
permittivity of vacuum, must be substituted if charges are considered in
non-empty media.

Continuous vs. discrete charge repartition

Main article: Charge density

The equations of electromagnetism are best described in a continuous
description. However, charges are sometimes best described as discrete
points; for example, some models may describe electrons as punctual sources
where charge density is infinite on an infinitesimal section of space.

A charge q located in r₀ can be described mathematically as a charge
density ρ(r)=qδ(r-r₀), where the Dirac delta function (in three dimensions)
is used. Conversely, a charge distribution can be approximated by many
small punctual charges.

Superposition principle

Electric fields satisfy the superposition principle, because Maxwell's
equations are linear. As a result, if E₁ and E₂ are the electric fields
resulting from distribution of charges ρ₁ and ρ₂, a distribution of charges
ρ_1+ρ₂ will create an electric field E_1+E₂; for instance, Coulomb's law is
linear in charge density as well.

This principle is useful to calculate the field created by multiple point
charges. If charges q₁, q₂, ..., qₙ are stationary in space at
r_1,r_2,...rₙ, in the absence of currents, the superposition principle
proves that the resulting field is the sum of fields generated by each
particle as described by Coulomb's law:

E(r) = Σ_{i=1}^N E_i(r) = \frac{1}{4πε₀} Σ_{i=1}^N q_i
\frac{r-r_i}{|r-r_i|³}

Electrostatic fields

Main article: Electrostatics

Electrostatic fields are E-fields which do not change with time, which
happens when charges and currents are stationary. In that case, Coulomb's
law fully describes the field.

Electric potential

Main article: Conservative vector field § Irrotational vector fields

By Faraday's law, the electric field has zero curl. One can then define an
electric potential, that is, a function Φ such that E = -\nabla Φ.³ This is
analogous to the gravitational potential.

Parallels between electrostatic and gravitational fields

Coulomb's law, which describes the interaction of electric charges:

F=q\left (\frac{Q}{4πε₀} \frac{\hat{r} }{|r|²} \right )=qE

is similar to Newton's law of universal gravitation:

F=m\left (-GM\frac{\hat{r} }{|r|²} \right )=mg

(where \hat{r} =\frac{r}{|r|} ).

This suggests similarities between the electric field E and the
gravitational field g, or their associated potentials. Mass is sometimes
called "gravitational charge" because of that similarity.

Electrostatic and gravitational forces both are central, conservative and
obey an inverse-square law.

Uniform fields

A uniform field is one in which the electric field is constant at every
point. It can be approximated by placing two conducting plates parallel to
each other and maintaining a voltage (potential difference) between them;
it is only an approximation because of boundary effects (near the edge of
the planes, electric field is distorted because the plane does not
continue). Assuming infinite planes, the magnitude of the electric field E
is:

E = - \frac{Δϕ}{d}

where Δϕ is the potential difference between the plates and d is the
distance separating the plates. The negative sign arises as positive
charges repel, so a positive charge will experience a force away from the
positively charged plate, in the opposite direction to that in which the
voltage increases. In micro- and nanoapplications, for instance in relation
to semiconductors, a typical magnitude of an electric field is in the order
of 10⁶ V⋅m−1, achieved by applying a voltage of the order of 1 volt between
conductors spaced 1 µm apart.

Electrodynamic fields

Main article: Electrodynamics

Electrodynamic fields are E-fields which do change with time, for instance
when charges are in motion.

The electric field cannot be described independently of the magnetic field
in that case. If A is the magnetic vector potential, defined so that B =
\nabla \times A , one can still define an electric potential Φ such that:

E = - \nabla Φ- \frac { \partial A } { \partial t }

One can recover Faraday's law of induction by taking the curl of that
equation

  ⁴
\nabla \times E = -\frac{\partial (\nabla \times A)}{\partial t} =
-\frac{\partial B}{\partial t}

which justifies, a posteriori, the previous form for E.

Energy in the electric field

If the magnetic field B is nonzero,

The total energy per unit volume stored by the electromagnetic field is⁵

u_{EM} = \frac{ε}{2} |E|^2 + \frac{1}{2μ} |B|²

where ε is the permittivity of the medium in which the field exists, μ its
magnetic permeability, and E and B are the electric and magnetic field
vectors.

As E and B fields are coupled, it would be misleading to split this
expression into "electric" and "magnetic" contributions. However, in the
steady-state case, the fields are no longer coupled (see Maxwell's
equations). It makes sense in that case to compute the electrostatic energy
per unit volume:

u_{ES} = \frac{1}{2} ε|E|^2 ,

The total energy U stored in the electric field in a given volume V is
therefore

U_{ES} = \frac{1}{2} ε∫_{V} |E|^2 \mathrm{d} V ,

Further extensions

Definitive equation of vector fields

See also: Defining equation (physics) and List of electromagnetism
equations

In the presence of matter, it is helpful in electromagnetism to extend the
notion of the electric field into three vector fields, rather than just
one:⁶

D=ε_0E+P

where P is the electric polarization – the volume density of electric
dipole moments, and D is the electric displacement field. Since E and P are
defined separately, this equation can be used to define D. The physical
interpretation of D is not as clear as E (effectively the field applied to
the material) or P (induced field due to the dipoles in the material), but
still serves as a convenient mathematical simplification, since Maxwell's
equations can be simplified in terms of free charges and currents.

Constitutive relation

Main article: Constitutive equation

The E and D fields are related by the permittivity of the material, ε.⁷ ⁸

For linear, homogeneous, isotropic materials E and D are proportional and
constant throughout the region, there is no position dependence: For
inhomogeneous materials, there is a position dependence throughout the
material:

D(r)=εE(r)

For anisotropic materials the E and D fields are not parallel, and so E and
D are related by the permittivity tensor (a 2nd order tensor field), in
component form:

D_i=ε_{ij}E_j

For non-linear media, E and D are not proportional. Materials can have
varying extents of linearity, homogeneity and isotropy.

Electromagnetic radiation

Electromagnetic radiation (EM radiation or EMR) is the radiant energy
released by certain electromagnetic processes. Visible light is one type of
electromagnetic radiation, other familiar forms are invisible
electromagnetic radiations such as radio waves, infrared light and X rays.

Classically, electromagnetic radiation consists of electromagnetic waves,
which are synchronized oscillations of electric and magnetic fields that
propagate at the speed of light through a vacuum. The oscillations of the
two fields are perpendicular to each other and perpendicular to the
direction of energy and wave propagation, forming a transverse wave.
Electromagnetic waves can be characterized by either the frequency or
wavelength of their oscillations to form the electromagnetic spectrum,
which includes, in order of increasing frequency and decreasing wavelength:
radio waves, microwaves, infrared radiation, visible light, ultraviolet
radiation, X-rays and gamma rays.

Electromagnetic waves are produced whenever charged particles are
accelerated, and these waves can subsequently interact with any charged
particles. EM waves carry energy, momentum and angular momentum away from
their source particle and can impart those quantities to matter with which
they interact. Quanta of EM waves are called photons, which are massless,
but they are still affected by gravity. Electromagnetic radiation is
associated with those EM waves that are free to propagate themselves
("radiate") without the continuing influence of the moving charges that
produced them, because they have achieved sufficient distance from those
charges. Thus, EMR is sometimes referred to as the far field. In this
jargon, the near field refers to EM fields near the charges and current
that directly produced them, specifically, electromagnetic induction and
electrostatic induction phenomena.

In the quantum theory of electromagnetism, EMR consists of photons, the
elementary particles responsible for all electromagnetic interactions.
Quantum effects provide additional sources of EMR, such as the transition
of electrons to lower energy levels in an atom and black-body radiation.
The energy of an individual photon is quantized and is greater for photons
of higher frequency. This relationship is given by Planck's equation E=hν,
where E is the energy per photon, ν is the frequency of the photon, and h
is Planck's constant. A single gamma ray photon, for example, might carry
~100,000 times the energy of a single photon of visible light.

The effects of EMR upon biological systems (and also to many other chemical
systems, under standard conditions) depend both upon the radiation's power
and its frequency. For EMR of visible frequencies or lower (i.e., radio,
microwave, infrared), the damage done to cells and other materials is
determined mainly by power and caused primarily by heating effects from the
combined energy transfer of many photons. By contrast, for ultraviolet and
higher frequencies (i.e., X-rays and gamma rays), chemical materials and
living cells can be further damaged beyond that done by simple heating,
since individual photons of such high frequency have enough energy to cause
direct molecular damage.

Physics

Theory

Main articles: Maxwell's equations and Near and far field

Maxwell's equations

James Clerk Maxwell first formally postulated electromagnetic waves. These
were subsequently confirmed by Heinrich Hertz. Maxwell derived a wave form
of the electric and magnetic equations, thus uncovering the wave-like
nature of electric and magnetic fields and their symmetry. Because the
speed of EM waves predicted by the wave equation coincided with the
measured speed of light, Maxwell concluded that light itself is an EM wave.

According to Maxwell's equations, a spatially varying electric field is
always associated with a magnetic field that changes over time. Likewise, a
spatially varying magnetic field is associated with specific changes over
time in the electric field. In an electromagnetic wave, the changes in the
electric field are always accompanied by a wave in the magnetic field in
one direction, and vice versa. This relationship between the two occurs
without either type field causing the other; rather, they occur together in
the same way that time and space changes occur together and are interlinked
in special relativity. In fact, magnetic fields may be viewed as
relativistic distortions of electric fields, so the close relationship
between space and time changes here is more than an analogy. Together,
these fields form a propagating electromagnetic wave, which moves out into
space and need never again affect the source. The distant EM field formed
in this way by the acceleration of a charge carries energy with it that
"radiates" away through space, hence the term.

Near and far fields

Main article: Liénard–Wiechert potential

Maxwell's equations established that some charges and currents ("sources")
produce a local type of electromagnetic field near them that does not have
the behaviour of EMR. Currents directly produce a magnetic field, but it is
of a magnetic dipole type that dies out with distance from the current. In
a similar manner, moving charges pushed apart in a conductor by a changing
electrical potential (such as in an antenna) produce an electric dipole
type electrical field, but this also declines with distance. These fields
make up the near-field near the EMR source. Neither of these behaviours are
responsible for EM radiation. Instead, they cause electromagnetic field
behaviour that only efficiently transfers power to a receiver very close to
the source, such as the magnetic induction inside a transformer, or the
feedback behaviour that happens close to the coil of a metal detector.
Typically, near-fields have a powerful effect on their own sources, causing
an increased "load" (decreased electrical reactance) in the source or
transmitter, whenever energy is withdrawn from the EM field by a receiver.
Otherwise, these fields do not "propagate" freely out into space, carrying
their energy away without distance-limit, but rather oscillate, returning
their energy to the transmitter if it is not received by a receiver.

By contrast, the EM far-field is composed of radiation that is free of the
transmitter in the sense that (unlike the case in an electrical
transformer) the transmitter requires the same power to send these changes
in the fields out, whether the signal is immediately picked up or not. This
distant part of the electromagnetic field is "electromagnetic radiation"
(also called the far-field). The far-fields propagate (radiate) without
allowing the transmitter to affect them. This causes them to be independent
in the sense that their existence and their energy, after they have left
the transmitter, is completely independent of both transmitter and
receiver. Because such waves conserve the amount of energy they transmit
through any spherical boundary surface drawn around their source, and
because such surfaces have an area that is defined by the square of the
distance from the source, the power of EM radiation always varies according
to an inverse-square law. This is in contrast to dipole parts of the EM
field close to the source (the near-field), which varies in power according
to an inverse cube power law, and thus does not transport a conserved
amount of energy over distances, but instead fades with distance, with its
energy (as noted) rapidly returning to the transmitter or absorbed by a
nearby receiver (such as a transformer secondary coil).

The far-field (EMR) depends on a different mechanism for its production
than the near-field, and upon different terms in Maxwell's equations.
Whereas the magnetic part of the near-field is due to currents in the
source, the magnetic field in EMR is due only to the local change in the
electric field. In a similar way, while the electric field in the
near-field is due directly to the charges and charge-separation in the
source, the electric field in EMR is due to a change in the local magnetic
field. Both processes for producing electric and magnetic EMR fields have a
different dependence on distance than do near-field dipole electric and
magnetic fields. That is why the EMR type of EM field becomes dominant in
power "far" from sources. The term "far from sources" refers to how far
from the source (moving at the speed of light) any portion of the
outward-moving EM field is located, by the time that source currents are
changed by the varying source potential, and the source has therefore begun
to generate an outwardly moving EM field of a different phase.

A more compact view of EMR is that the far-field that composes EMR is
generally that part of the EM field that has traveled sufficient distance
from the source, that it has become completely disconnected from any
feedback to the charges and currents that were originally responsible for
it. Now independent of the source charges, the EM field, as it moves
farther away, is dependent only upon the accelerations of the charges that
produced it. It no longer has a strong connection to the direct fields of
the charges, or to the velocity of the charges (currents).

In the Liénard–Wiechert potential formulation of the electric and magnetic
fields due to motion of a single particle (according to Maxwell's
equations), the terms associated with acceleration of the particle are
those that are responsible for the part of the field that is regarded as
electromagnetic radiation. By contrast, the term associated with the
changing static electric field of the particle and the magnetic term that
results from the particle's uniform velocity, are both associated with the
electromagnetic near-field, and do not comprise EM radiation.

Properties

The physics of electromagnetic radiation is electrodynamics.
Electromagnetism is the physical phenomenon associated with the theory of
electrodynamics. Electric and magnetic fields obey the properties of
superposition. Thus, a field due to any particular particle or time-varying
electric or magnetic field contributes to the fields present in the same
space due to other causes. Further, as they are vector fields, all magnetic
and electric field vectors add together according to vector addition. For
example, in optics two or more coherent lightwaves may interact and by
constructive or destructive interference yield a resultant irradiance
deviating from the sum of the component irradiances of the individual
lightwaves.

Since light is an oscillation it is not affected by travelling through
static electric or magnetic fields in a linear medium such as a vacuum.
However, in nonlinear media, such as some crystals, interactions can occur
between light and static electric and magnetic fields — these interactions
include the Faraday effect and the Kerr effect.

In refraction, a wave crossing from one medium to another of different
density alters its speed and direction upon entering the new medium. The
ratio of the refractive indices of the media determines the degree of
refraction, and is summarized by Snell's law. Light of composite
wavelengths (natural sunlight) disperses into a visible spectrum passing
through a prism, because of the wavelength-dependent refractive index of
the prism material (dispersion); that is, each component wave within the
composite light is bent a different amount.

EM radiation exhibits both wave properties and particle properties at the
same time (see wave-particle duality). Both wave and particle
characteristics have been confirmed in many experiments. Wave
characteristics are more apparent when EM radiation is measured over
relatively large timescales and over large distances while particle
characteristics are more evident when measuring small timescales and
distances. For example, when electromagnetic radiation is absorbed by
matter, particle-like properties will be more obvious when the average
number of photons in the cube of the relevant wavelength is much smaller
than 1. It is not too difficult to experimentally observe non-uniform
deposition of energy when light is absorbed, however this alone is not
evidence of "particulate" behavior. Rather, it reflects the quantum nature
of matter.¹ Demonstrating that the light itself is quantized, not merely
its interaction with matter, is a more subtle affair.

Some experiments display both the wave and particle natures of
electromagnetic waves, such as the self-interference of a single photon.²
When a single photon is sent through an interferometer, it passes through
both paths, interfering with itself, as waves do, yet is detected by a
photomultiplier or other sensitive detector only once.

A quantum theory of the interaction between electromagnetic radiation and
matter such as electrons is described by the theory of quantum
electrodynamics.

Wave model

Electromagnetic radiation is a transverse wave, meaning that its
oscillations are perpendicular to the direction of energy transfer and
travel. The electric and magnetic parts of the field stand in a fixed ratio
of strengths in order to satisfy the two Maxwell equations that specify how
one is produced from the other. These E and B fields are also in phase,
with both reaching maxima and minima at the same points in space (see
illustrations). A common misconception is that the E and B fields in
electromagnetic radiation are out of phase because a change in one produces
the other, and this would produce a phase difference between them as
sinusoidal functions (as indeed happens in electromagnetic induction, and
in the near-field close to antennas). However, in the far-field EM
radiation which is described by the two source-free Maxwell curl operator
equations, a more correct description is that a time-change in one type of
field is proportional to a space-change in the other. These derivatives
require that the E and B fields in EMR are in-phase (see math section
below).

An important aspect of light's nature is its frequency. The frequency of a
wave is its rate of oscillation and is measured in hertz, the SI unit of
frequency, where one hertz is equal to one oscillation per second. Light
usually has multiple frequencies that sum to form the resultant wave.
Different frequencies undergo different angles of refraction, a phenomenon
known as dispersion.

A wave consists of successive troughs and crests, and the distance between
two adjacent crests or troughs is called the wavelength. Waves of the
electromagnetic spectrum vary in size, from very long radio waves the size
of buildings to very short gamma rays smaller than atom nuclei. Frequency
is inversely proportional to wavelength, according to the equation:

\displaystyle v=fλ

where v is the speed of the wave (c in a vacuum, or less in other media), f
is the frequency and λ is the wavelength. As waves cross boundaries between
different media, their speeds change but their frequencies remain constant.

Electromagnetic waves in free space must be solutions of Maxwell's
electromagnetic wave equation. Two main classes of solutions are known,
namely plane waves and spherical waves. The plane waves may be viewed as
the limiting case of spherical waves at a very large (ideally infinite)
distance from the source. Both types of waves can have a waveform which is
an arbitrary time function (so long as it is sufficiently differentiable to
conform to the wave equation). As with any time function, this can be
decomposed by means of Fourier analysis into its frequency spectrum, or
individual sinusoidal components, each of which contains a single
frequency, amplitude and phase. Such a component wave is said to be
monochromatic. A monochromatic electromagnetic wave can be characterized by
its frequency or wavelength, its peak amplitude, its phase relative to some
reference phase, its direction of propagation and its polarization.

Interference is the superposition of two or more waves resulting in a new
wave pattern. If the fields have components in the same direction, they
constructively interfere, while opposite directions cause destructive
interference. An example of interference caused by EMR is electromagnetic
interference (EMI) or as it is more commonly known as, radio-frequency
interference (RFI).

The energy in electromagnetic waves is sometimes called radiant energy.

Particle model and quantum theory

See also: Quantization (physics) and Quantum optics

An anomaly arose in the late 19th century involving a contradiction between
the wave theory of light and measurements of the electromagnetic spectra
that were being emitted by thermal radiators known as black bodies.
Physicists struggled with this problem, which later became known as the
ultraviolet catastrophe, unsuccessfully for many years. In 1900, Max Planck
developed a new theory of black-body radiation that explained the observed
spectrum. Planck's theory was based on the idea that black bodies emit
light (and other electromagnetic radiation) only as discrete bundles or
packets of energy. These packets were called quanta. Later, Albert Einstein
proposed that light quanta be regarded as real particles. Later the
particle of light was given the name photon, to correspond with other
particles being described around this time, such as the electron and
proton. A photon has an energy, E, proportional to its frequency, f, by

E = hf = \frac{hc}{λ}

where h is Planck's constant, λ is the wavelength and c is the speed of
light. This is sometimes known as the Planck–Einstein equation.³ In quantum
theory (see first quantization) the energy of the photons is thus directly
proportional to the frequency of the EMR wave.⁴

Likewise, the momentum p of a photon is also proportional to its frequency
and inversely proportional to its wavelength:

p = { E \over c } = { hf \over c } = { h \over λ}.

The source of Einstein's proposal that light was composed of particles (or
could act as particles in some circumstances) was an experimental anomaly
not explained by the wave theory: the photoelectric effect, in which light
striking a metal surface ejected electrons from the surface, causing an
electric current to flow across an applied voltage. Experimental
measurements demonstrated that the energy of individual ejected electrons
was proportional to the frequency, rather than the intensity, of the light.
Furthermore, below a certain minimum frequency, which depended on the
particular metal, no current would flow regardless of the intensity. These
observations appeared to contradict the wave theory, and for years
physicists tried in vain to find an explanation. In 1905, Einstein
explained this puzzle by resurrecting the particle theory of light to
explain the observed effect. Because of the preponderance of evidence in
favor of the wave theory, however, Einstein's ideas were met initially with
great skepticism among established physicists. Eventually Einstein's
explanation was accepted as new particle-like behavior of light was
observed, such as the Compton effect.

As a photon is absorbed by an atom, it excites the atom, elevating an
electron to a higher energy level (one that is on average farther from the
nucleus). When an electron in an excited molecule or atom descends to a
lower energy level, it emits a photon of light at a frequency corresponding
to the energy difference. Since the energy levels of electrons in atoms are
discrete, each element and each molecule emits and absorbs its own
characteristic frequencies. Immediate photon emission is called
fluorescence, a type of photoluminescence. An example is visible light
emitted from fluorescent paints, in response to ultraviolet (blacklight).
Many other fluorescent emissions are known in spectral bands other than
visible light. Delayed emission is called phosphorescence.

Wave–particle duality

The modern theory that explains the nature of light includes the notion of
wave–particle duality. More generally, the theory states that everything
has both a particle nature and a wave nature, and various experiments can
be done to bring out one or the other. The particle nature is more easily
discerned using an object with a large mass. A bold proposition by Louis de
Broglie in 1924 led the scientific community to realize that electrons also
exhibited wave–particle duality.

Wave and particle effects of electromagnetic radiation

Together, wave and particle effects fully explain the emission and
absorption spectra of EM radiation. The matter-composition of the medium
through which the light travels determines the nature of the absorption and
emission spectrum. These bands correspond to the allowed energy levels in
the atoms. Dark bands in the absorption spectrum are due to the atoms in an
intervening medium between source and observer. The atoms absorb certain
frequencies of the light between emitter and detector/eye, then emit them
in all directions. A dark band appears to the detector, due to the
radiation scattered out of the beam. For instance, dark bands in the light
emitted by a distant star are due to the atoms in the star's atmosphere. A
similar phenomenon occurs for emission, which is seen when an emitting gas
glows due to excitation of the atoms from any mechanism, including heat. As
electrons descend to lower energy levels, a spectrum is emitted that
represents the jumps between the energy levels of the electrons, but lines
are seen because again emission happens only at particular energies after
excitation. An example is the emission spectrum of nebulae. Rapidly moving
electrons are most sharply accelerated when they encounter a region of
force, so they are responsible for producing much of the highest frequency
electromagnetic radiation observed in nature.

These phenomena can aid various chemical determinations for the composition
of gases lit from behind (absorption spectra) and for glowing gases
(emission spectra). Spectroscopy (for example) determines what chemical
elements comprise a particular star. Spectroscopy is also used in the
determination of the distance of a star, using the red shift.

Propagation speed

Main article: Speed of light

Any electric charge that accelerates, or any changing magnetic field,
produces electromagnetic radiation. Electromagnetic information about the
charge travels at the speed of light. Accurate treatment thus incorporates
a concept known as retarded time, which adds to the expressions for the
electrodynamic electric field and magnetic field. These extra terms are
responsible for electromagnetic radiation.

When any wire (or other conducting object such as an antenna) conducts
alternating current, electromagnetic radiation is propagated at the same
frequency as the current. In many such situations it is possible to
identify an electrical dipole moment that arises from separation of charges
due to the exciting electrical potential, and this dipole moment oscillates
in time, as the charges move back and forth. This oscillation at a given
frequency gives rise to changing electric and magnetic fields, which then
set the electromagnetic radiation in motion.

At the quantum level, electromagnetic radiation is produced when the
wavepacket of a charged particle oscillates or otherwise accelerates.
Charged particles in a stationary state do not move, but a superposition of
such states may result in a transition state that has an electric dipole
moment that oscillates in time. This oscillating dipole moment is
responsible for the phenomenon of radiative transition between quantum
states of a charged particle. Such states occur (for example) in atoms when
photons are radiated as the atom shifts from one stationary state to
another.

As a wave, light is characterized by a velocity (the speed of light),
wavelength, and frequency. As particles, light is a stream of photons. Each
has an energy related to the frequency of the wave given by Planck's
relation E = hf, where E is the energy of the photon, h = 6.626 × 10−34 J·s
is Planck's constant, and f is the frequency of the wave.

One rule is obeyed regardless of circumstances: EM radiation in a vacuum
travels at the speed of light, relative to the observer, regardless of the
observer's velocity. (This observation led to Einstein's development of the
theory of special relativity.)

In a medium (other than vacuum), velocity factor or refractive index are
considered, depending on frequency and application. Both of these are
ratios of the speed in a medium to speed in a vacuum.

Special theory of relativity

Main article: Special theory of relativity

By the late nineteenth century, various experimental anomalies could not be
explained by the simple wave theory. One of these anomalies involved a
controversy over the speed of light. The speed of light and other EMR
predicted by Maxwell's equations did not appear unless the equations were
modified in a way first suggested by FitzGerald and Lorentz (see history of
special relativity), or else otherwise that speed would depend on the speed
of observer relative to the "medium" (called luminiferous aether) which
supposedly "carried" the electromagnetic wave (in a manner analogous to the
way air carries sound waves). Experiments failed to find any observer
effect. In 1905, Einstein proposed that space and time appeared to be
velocity-changeable entities for light propagation and all other processes
and laws. These changes accounted for the constancy of the speed of light
and all electromagnetic radiation, from the viewpoints of all
observers—even those in relative motion.

History of discovery

Electromagnetic radiation of wavelengths other than those of visible light
were discovered in the early 19th century. The discovery of infrared
radiation is ascribed to astronomer William Herschel, who published his
results in 1800 before the Royal Society of London.⁵ Herschel used a glass
prism to refract light from the Sun and detected invisible rays that caused
heating beyond the red part of the spectrum, through an increase in the
temperature recorded with a thermometer. These "calorific rays" were later
termed infrared.

In 1801, German physicist Johann Wilhelm Ritter discovered ultraviolet in
an experiment similar to Hershel's, using sunlight and a glass prism.
Ritter noted that invisible rays near the violet edge of a solar spectrum
dispersed by a triangular prism darkened silver chloride preparations more
quickly than did the nearby violet light. Ritter's experiments were an
early precursor to what would become photography. Ritter noted that the
ultraviolet rays (which at first were called "chemical rays") were capable
of causing chemical reactions.

In 1862-4 James Clerk Maxwell developed equations for the electromagnetic
field which suggested that waves in the field would travel with a speed
that was very close to the known speed of light. Maxwell therefore
suggested that visible light (as well as invisible infrared and ultraviolet
rays by inference) all consisted of propagating disturbances (or radiation)
in the electromagnetic field. Radio waves were first produced deliberately
by Heinrich Hertz in 1887, using electrical circuits calculated to produce
oscillations at a much lower frequency than that of visible light,
following recipes for producing oscillating charges and currents suggested
by Maxwell's equations. Hertz also developed ways to detect these waves,
and produced and characterized what were later termed radio waves and
microwaves.⁶ :286,7

Wilhelm Röntgen discovered and named X-rays. After experimenting with high
voltages applied to an evaccuated tube on 8 November 1895, he noticed a
fluorescence on a nearby plate of coated glass. In one month, he discovered
X-rays' main properties.⁶ :307

The last portion of the EM spectrum to be discovered was associated with
radioactivity. Henri Becquerel found that uranium salts caused fogging of
an unexposed photographic plate through a covering paper in a manner
similar to X-rays, and Marie Curie discovered that only certain elements
gave off these rays of energy, soon discovering the intense radiation of
radium. The radiation from pitchblende was differentiated into alpha rays
(alpha particles) and beta rays (beta particles) by Ernest Rutherford
through simple experimentation in 1899, but these proved to be charged
particulate types of radiation. However, in 1900 the French scientist Paul
Villard discovered a third neutrally charged and especially penetrating
type of radiation from radium, and after he described it, Rutherford
realized it must be yet a third type of radiation, which in 1903 Rutherford
named gamma rays. In 1910 British physicist William Henry Bragg
demonstrated that gamma rays are electromagnetic radiation, not particles,
and in 1914 Rutherford and Edward Andrade measured their wavelengths,
finding that they were similar to X-rays but with shorter wavelengths and
higher frequency, although a 'cross-over' between X and gamma rays makes it
possible to have X-rays with a higher energy (and hence shorter wavelength)
than gamma rays and vice versa. The origin of the ray differentiates them,
gamma rays tend to be a natural phenomena originating from the unstable
nucleus of an atom and X-rays are electrically generated (and hence
man-made) unless they are as a result of bremsstrahlung X-radiation caused
by the interaction of fast moving particles (such as beta particles)
colliding with certain materials, usually of higher atomic numbers.⁶ :308,9

Electromagnetic spectrum

Main article: Electromagnetic spectrum

EM radiation (the designation 'radiation' excludes static electric and
magnetic and near fields) is classified by wavelength into radio,
microwave, infrared, visible, ultraviolet, X-rays and gamma rays. Arbitrary
electromagnetic waves can be expressed by Fourier analysis in terms of
sinusoidal monochromatic waves, which in turn can each be classified into
these regions of the EMR spectrum.

For certain classes of EM waves, the waveform is most usefully treated as
random, and then spectral analysis must be done by slightly different
mathematical techniques appropriate to random or stochastic processes. In
such cases, the individual frequency components are represented in terms of
their power content, and the phase information is not preserved. Such a
representation is called the power spectral density of the random process.
Random electromagnetic radiation requiring this kind of analysis is, for
example, encountered in the interior of stars, and in certain other very
wideband forms of radiation such as the Zero point wave field of the
electromagnetic vacuum.

The behavior of EM radiation depends on its frequency. Lower frequencies
have longer wavelengths, and higher frequencies have shorter wavelengths,
and are associated with photons of higher energy. There is no fundamental
limit known to these wavelengths or energies, at either end of the
spectrum, although photons with energies near the Planck energy or
exceeding it (far too high to have ever been observed) will require new
physical theories to describe.

Soundwaves are not electromagnetic radiation. At the lower end of the
electromagnetic spectrum, about 20 Hz to about 20 kHz, are frequencies that
might be considered in the audio range. However, electromagnetic waves
cannot be directly perceived by human ears. Sound waves are instead the
oscillating compression of molecules. To be heard, electromagnetic
radiation must be converted to pressure waves of the fluid in which the ear
is located (whether the fluid is air, water or something else).

Interactions as a function of frequency

When EM radiation interacts with matter, its behavior changes qualitatively
as its frequency changes.

Radio and microwave

At radio and microwave frequencies, EMR interacts with matter largely as a
bulk collection of charges which are spread out over large numbers of
affected atoms. In electrical conductors, such induced bulk movement of
charges (electric currents) results in absorption of the EMR, or else
separations of charges that cause generation of new EMR (effective
reflection of the EMR). An example is absorption or emission of radio waves
by antennas, or absorption of microwaves by water or other molecules with
an electric dipole moment, as for example inside a microwave oven. These
interactions produce either electric currents or heat, or both. Infrared
EMR interacts with dipoles present in single molecules, which change as
atoms vibrate at the ends of a single chemical bond. For this reason,
infrared is reflected by metals (as is most EMR into the ultraviolet) but
is absorbed by a wide range of substances, causing them to increase in
temperature as the vibrations dissipate as heat. In the same process, bulk
substances radiate in the infrared spontaneously (see thermal radiation
section below).

Visible light

As frequency increases into the visible range, photons of EMR have enough
energy to change the bond structure of some individual molecules. It is not
a coincidence that this happens in the "visible range," as the mechanism of
vision involves the change in bonding of a single molecule (retinal) which
absorbs light in the rhodopsin in the retina of the human eye.
Photosynthesis becomes possible in this range as well, for similar reasons,
as a single molecule of chlorophyll is excited by a single photon. Animals
that detect infrared make use of small packets of water that change
temperature, in an essentially thermal process that involves many photons
(see infrared sensing in snakes). For this reason, infrared, microwaves and
radio waves are thought to damage molecules and biological tissue only by
bulk heating, not excitation from single photons of the radiation.

Visible light is able to affect a few molecules with single photons, but
usually not in a permanent or damaging way, in the absence of power high
enough to increase temperature to damaging levels. However, in plant
tissues that conduct photosynthesis, carotenoids act to quench
electronically excited chlorophyll produced by visible light in a process
called non-photochemical quenching, in order to prevent reactions that
would otherwise interfere with photosynthesis at high light levels. Limited
evidence indicate that some reactive oxygen species are created by visible
light in skin, and that these may have some role in photoaging, in the same
manner as ultraviolet A.⁷

Ultraviolet

As frequency increases into the ultraviolet, photons now carry enough
energy (about three electron volts or more) to excite certain doubly bonded
molecules into permanent chemical rearrangement. In DNA, this causes
lasting damage. DNA is also indirectly damaged by reactive oxygen species
produced by ultraviolet A (UVA), which has energy too low to damage DNA
directly. This is why ultraviolet at all wavelengths can damage DNA, and is
capable of causing cancer, and (for UVB) skin burns (sunburn) that are far
worse than would be produced by simple heating (temperature increase)
effects. This property of causing molecular damage that is out of
proportion to heating effects, is characteristic of all EMR with
frequencies at the visible light range and above. These properties of
high-frequency EMR are due to quantum effects that permanently damage
materials and tissues at the molecular level.

At the higher end of the ultraviolet range, the energy of photons becomes
large enough to impart enough energy to electrons to cause them to be
liberated from the atom, in a process called photoionisation. The energy
required for this is always larger than about 10 electron volts (eV)
corresponding with wavelengths smaller than 124 nm (some sources suggest a
more realistic cutoff of 33 eV, which is the energy required to ionize
water). This high end of the ultraviolet spectrum with energies in the
approximate ionization range, is sometimes called "extreme UV." Ionizing UV
is strongly filtered by the Earth's atmosphere).

X-rays and gamma rays

Electromagnetic radiation composed of photons that carry minimum-ionization
energy, or more, (which includes the entire spectrum with shorter
wavelengths), is therefore termed ionizing radiation. (Many other kinds of
ionizing radiation are made of non-EM particles). Electromagnetic-type
ionizing radiation extends from the extreme ultraviolet to all higher
frequencies and shorter wavelengths, which means that all X-rays and gamma
rays qualify. These are capable of the most severe types of molecular
damage, which can happen in biology to any type of biomolecule, including
mutation and cancer, and often at great depths below the skin, since the
higher end of the X-ray spectrum, and all of the gamma ray spectrum,
penetrate matter. This type of damage causes these types of radiation to be
especially carefully monitored, due to their hazard, even at comparatively
low-energies, to all living organisms.

Atmosphere and magnetosphere

Main articles: ozone layer, shortwave radio, skywave and ionosphere

Most UV and X-rays are blocked by absorption first from molecular nitrogen,
and then (for wavelengths in the upper UV) from the electronic excitation
of dioxygen and finally ozone at the mid-range of UV. Only 30% of the Sun's
ultraviolet light reaches the ground, and almost all of this is well
transmitted.

Visible light is well transmitted in air, as it is not energetic enough to
excite nitrogen, oxygen, or ozone, but too energetic to excite molecular
vibrational frequencies of water vapor.

Absorption bands in the infrared are due to modes of vibrational excitation
in water vapor. However, at energies too low to excite water vapor, the
atmosphere becomes transparent again, allowing free transmission of most
microwave and radio waves.

Finally, at radio wavelengths longer than 10 meters or so (about 30 MHz),
the air in the lower atmosphere remains transparent to radio, but plasma in
certain layers of the ionosphere begins to interact with radio waves (see
skywave). This property allows some longer wavelengths (100 meters or 3
MHz) to be reflected and results in shortwave radio beyond line-of-sight.
However, certain ionospheric effects begin to block incoming radiowaves
from space, when their frequency is less than about 10 MHz (wavelength
longer than about 30 meters).

Types and sources, classed by spectral band

See electromagnetic spectrum

Radio waves

Main article: Radio waves

When radio waves impinge upon a conductor, they couple to the conductor,
travel along it and induce an electric current on the conductor surface by
moving the electrons of the conducting material in correlated bunches of
charge. Such effects can cover macroscopic distances in conductors
(including as radio antennas), since the wavelength of radiowaves is long.

Microwaves

Main article: Microwaves

Microwaves are a form of electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths ranging
from as long as one meter to as short as one millimeter; with frequencies
between 300 MHz (0.3 GHz) and 300 GHz.

Infrared

Natural sources produce EM radiation across the spectrum. EM radiation with
a wavelength between approximately 400 nm and 700 nm is directly detected
by the human eye and perceived as visible light. Other wavelengths,
especially nearby infrared (longer than 700 nm) and ultraviolet (shorter
than 400 nm) are also sometimes referred to as light.

Thermal radiation and electromagnetic radiation as a form of heat

Main articles: Thermal radiation and Planck's law

The basic structure of matter involves charged particles bound together.
When electromagnetic radiation impinges on matter, it causes the charged
particles to oscillate and gain energy. The ultimate fate of this energy
depends on the context. It could be immediately re-radiated and appear as
scattered, reflected, or transmitted radiation. It may get dissipated into
other microscopic motions within the matter, coming to thermal equilibrium
and manifesting itself as thermal energy in the material. With a few
exceptions related to high-energy photons (such as fluorescence, harmonic
generation, photochemical reactions, the photovoltaic effect for ionizing
radiations at far ultraviolet, X-ray and gamma radiation), absorbed
electromagnetic radiation simply deposits its energy by heating the
material. This happens for infrared, microwave and radio wave radiation.
Intense radio waves can thermally burn living tissue and can cook food. In
addition to infrared lasers, sufficiently intense visible and ultraviolet
lasers can easily set paper afire.

Ionizing radiation creates high-speed electrons in a material and breaks
chemical bonds, but after these electrons collide many times with other
atoms eventually most of the energy becomes thermal energy all in a tiny
fraction of a second. This process makes ionizing radiation far more
dangerous per unit of energy than non-ionizing radiation. This caveat also
applies to UV, even though almost all of it is not ionizing, because UV can
damage molecules due to electronic excitation, which is far greater per
unit energy than heating effects.

Infrared radiation in the spectral distribution of a black body is usually
considered a form of heat, since it has an equivalent temperature and is
associated with an entropy change per unit of thermal energy. However,
"heat" is a technical term in physics and thermodynamics and is often
confused with thermal energy. Any type of electromagnetic energy can be
transformed into thermal energy in interaction with matter. Thus, any
electromagnetic radiation can "heat" (in the sense of increase the thermal
energy termperature of) a material, when it is absorbed.

The inverse or time-reversed process of absorption is thermal radiation.
Much of the thermal energy in matter consists of random motion of charged
particles, and this energy can be radiated away from the matter. The
resulting radiation may subsequently be absorbed by another piece of
matter, with the deposited energy heating the material.

The electromagnetic radiation in an opaque cavity at thermal equilibrium is
effectively a form of thermal energy, having maximum radiation entropy.

Biological effects

Main articles: Electromagnetic radiation and health and Mobile phone
radiation and health

Bioelectromagnetics is the study of the interactions and effects of EM
radiation on living organisms. The effects of electromagnetic radiation
upon living cells, including those in humans, depends upon the radiation's
power and frequency. For low-frequency radiation (radio waves to visible
light) the best-understood effects are those due to radiation power alone,
acting through heating when radiation is absorbed. For these thermal
effects, frequency is important only as it affects penetration into the
organism (for example, microwaves penetrate better than infrared).
Initially, it was believed that low frequency fields that were too weak to
cause significant heating could not possibly have any biological effect.⁸

Despite this opinion among researchers, evidence has accumulated that
supports the existence of complex biological effects of weaker non-thermal
electromagnetic fields, (including weak ELF magnetic fields, although the
latter does not strictly qualify as EM radiation⁸ ⁹ ¹⁰ ), and modulated RF
and microwave fields.¹¹ ¹² ¹³ Fundamental mechanisms of the interaction
between biological material and electromagnetic fields at non-thermal
levels are not fully understood.⁸

The World Health Organization has classified radio frequency
electromagnetic radiation as Group 2B - possibly carcinogenic.¹⁴ ¹⁵ This
group contains possible carcinogens that have weaker evidence, at the same
level as coffee and automobile exhaust. For example, epidemiological
studies looking for a relationship between cell phone use and brain cancer
development, have been largely inconclusive, save to demonstrate that the
effect, if it exists, cannot be a large one.

At higher frequencies (visible and beyond), the effects of individual
photons begin to become important, as these now have enough energy
individually to directly or indirectly damage biological molecules.¹⁶ All
UV frequences have been classed as Group 1 carcinogens by the World Health
Organization. Ultraviolet radiation from sun exposure is the primary cause
of skin cancer.¹⁷ ¹⁸

Thus, at UV frequencies and higher (and probably somewhat also in the
visible range),⁷ electromagnetic radiation does more damage to biological
systems than simple heating predicts. This is most obvious in the "far" (or
"extreme") ultraviolet. UV, with X-ray and gamma radiation, are referred to
as ionizing radiation due to the ability of photons of this radiation to
produce ions and free radicals in materials (including living tissue).
Since such radiation can severely damage life at energy levels that produce
little heating, it is considered far more dangerous (in terms of
damage-produced per unit of energy, or power) than the rest of the
electromagnetic spectrum.

Derivation from electromagnetic theory

Main article: Electromagnetic wave equation

Electromagnetic waves were predicted by the classical laws of electricity
and magnetism, known as Maxwell's equations. Inspection of Maxwell's
equations without sources (charges or currents) results in nontrivial
solutions of changing electric and magnetic fields. Beginning with
Maxwell's equations in free space:

  \nabla ·E = 0 \qquad \qquad \qquad (1)
  \nabla \times E = -\frac{\partial B}{\partial t} \qquad \qquad (2)
  \nabla ·B = 0 \qquad \qquad \qquad (3)
  \nabla \times B = μ_0 ϵ_0 \frac{\partial E}{\partial t} \qquad (4)
  where
    \nabla is a vector differential operator (see Del).

One solution,

  E=B=0,

is trivial.

For a more useful solution, we utilize vector identities, which work for
any vector, as follows:

  \nabla \times \left ( \nabla \times A \right ) = \nabla \left ( \nabla ·A
  \right ) - \nabla ^2 A

The curl of equation (2):

  \nabla \times \left (\nabla \times E \right ) = \nabla \times \left
  (-\frac{\partial B}{\partial t} \right ) \qquad \qquad \qquad (5)

Evaluating the left hand side:

  \nabla \times \left (\nabla \times E \right ) = \nabla \left (\nabla ·E
  \right ) - \nabla ^2 E = - \nabla ^2 E \qquad (6)
  simplifying the above by using equation (1).

Evaluating the right hand side:

  \nabla \times \left (-\frac{\partial B}{\partial t} \right ) =
  -\frac{\partial }{\partial t} \left ( \nabla \times B \right ) = -μ_0 ϵ_0
  \frac{\partial ^2 E}{\partial t²} (7)

Equations (6) and (7) are equal, so this results in a vector-valued
differential equation for the electric field, namely

Applying a similar pattern results in similar differential equation for the
magnetic field:

These differential equations are equivalent to the wave equation:

  \nabla ^2 f = \frac{1}{{c₀}²} \frac{\partial ² f}{\partial t²}
  where
    c₀ is the speed of the wave in free space andf describes a displacement

Or more simply:

  \Box f = 0
  where \Box is d'Alembertian:\Box = \nabla ^2 - \frac{1}{{c₀}²}
  \frac{\partial ²}{\partial t²} = \frac{\partial ²}{\partial x²} +
  \frac{\partial ²}{\partial y²} + \frac{\partial ²}{\partial z²} -
  \frac{1}{{c₀}²} \frac{\partial ²}{\partial t²}

In the case of the electric and magnetic fields, the speed is:

  c_0 = \frac{1}{√(μ_0 ϵ₀)}

This is the speed of light in vacuum. Maxwell's equations unified the
vacuum permittivity ϵ₀, the vacuum permeability μ₀, and the speed of light
itself, c₀. This relationship had been discovered by Wilhelm Eduard Weber
and Rudolf Kohlrausch prior to the development of Maxwell's
electrodynamics, however Maxwell was the first to produce a field theory
consistent with waves traveling at the speed of light.

These are only two equations versus the original four, so more information
pertains to these waves hidden within Maxwell's equations. A generic vector
wave for the electric field.

E = E_0 f\left ( \hat{k} ·x - c_0 t \right )

Here, E₀ is the constant amplitude, f is any second differentiable
function, \hat{k} is a unit vector in the direction of propagation, and {x}
is a position vector. f\left ( \hat{k} ·x - c_0 t \right ) is a generic
solution to the wave equation. In other words,

\nabla ^2 f\left ( \hat{k} ·x - c_0 t \right ) = \frac{1}{{c₀}²}
\frac{\partial ²}{\partial t²} f\left ( \hat{k} ·x - c_0 t \right ),

for a generic wave traveling in the \hat{k} direction.

This form will satisfy the wave equation.

\nabla ·E = \hat{k} ·E_0 f'\left ( \hat{k} ·x - c_0 t \right ) = 0
E ·\hat{k} = 0

The first of Maxwell's equations implies that the electric field is
orthogonal to the direction the wave propagates.

\nabla \times E = \hat{k} \times E_0 f'\left ( \hat{k} ·x - c_0 t \right )
= -\frac{\partial B}{\partial t}
B = \frac{1}{c₀} \hat{k} \times E

The second of Maxwell's equations yields the magnetic field. The remaining
equations will be satisfied by this choice of E,B.

The electric and magnetic field waves in the far-field travel at the speed
of light. They have a special restricted orientation and proportional
magnitudes, E₀ ₌ c₀ B₀, which can be seen immediately from the Poynting
vector. The electric field, magnetic field, and direction of wave
propagation are all orthogonal, and the wave propagates in the same
direction as E \times B. Also, E and B far-fields in free space, which as
wave solutions depend primarily on these two Maxwell equations, are
in-phase with each other. This is guaranteed since the generic wave
solution is first order in both space and time, and the curl operator on
one side of these equations results in first-order spatial derivatives of
the wave solution, while the time-derivative on the other side of the
equations, which gives the other field, is first order in time, resulting
in the same phase shift for both fields in each mathematical operation.

From the viewpoint of an electromagnetic wave traveling forward, the
electric field might be oscillating up and down, while the magnetic field
oscillates right and left. This picture can be rotated with the electric
field oscillating right and left and the magnetic field oscillating down
and up. This is a different solution that is traveling in the same
direction. This arbitrariness in the orientation with respect to
propagation direction is known as polarization. On a quantum level, it is
described as photon polarization. The direction of the polarization is
defined as the direction of the electric field.

More general forms of the second-order wave equations given above are
available, allowing for both non-vacuum propagation media and sources. Many
competing derivations exist, all with varying levels of approximation and
intended applications. One very general example is a form of the electric
field equation,¹⁹ which was factorized into a pair of explicitly
directional wave equations, and then efficiently reduced into a single
uni-directional wave equation by means of a simple slow-evolution
approximation.

Electromagnetism

Electromagnetism is a branch of physics which involves the study of the
electromagnetic force, a type of physical interaction that occurs between
electrically charged particles. The electromagnetic force usually shows
electromagnetic fields, such as electric fields, magnetic fields, and
light. The electromagnetic force is one of the four fundamental
interactions in nature. The other three fundamental interactions are the
strong interaction, the weak interaction, and gravitation.¹

The word electromagnetism is a compound form of two Greek terms, ἤλεκτρον,
ēlektron, "amber", and μαγνῆτις λίθος magnētis lithos, which means
"magnesian stone", a type of iron ore. The science of electromagnetic
phenomena is defined in terms of the electromagnetic force, sometimes
called the Lorentz force, which includes both electricity and magnetism as
elements of one phenomenon.

The electromagnetic force plays a major role in determining the internal
properties of most objects encountered in daily life. Ordinary matter takes
its form as a result of intermolecular forces between individual molecules
in matter. Electrons are bound by electromagnetic wave mechanics into
orbitals around atomic nuclei to form atoms, which are the building blocks
of molecules. This governs the processes involved in chemistry, which arise
from interactions between the electrons of neighboring atoms, which are in
turn determined by the interaction between electromagnetic force and the
momentum of the electrons.

There are numerous mathematical descriptions of the electromagnetic field.
In classical electrodynamics, electric fields are described as electric
potential and electric current in Ohm's law, magnetic fields are associated
with electromagnetic induction and magnetism, and Maxwell's equations
describe how electric and magnetic fields are generated and altered by each
other and by charges and currents.

The theoretical implications of electromagnetism, in particular the
establishment of the speed of light based on properties of the "medium" of
propagation (permeability and permittivity), led to the development of
special relativity by Albert Einstein in 1905.

Although electromagnetism is considered one of the four fundamental forces,
at high energy the weak force and electromagnetism are unified. In the
history of the universe, during the quark epoch, the electroweak force
split into the electromagnetic and weak forces.

History of the theory

See also: History of electromagnetic theory

Originally electricity and magnetism were thought of as two separate
forces. This view changed, however, with the publication of James Clerk
Maxwell's 1873 A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism in which the
interactions of positive and negative charges were shown to be regulated by
one force. There are four main effects resulting from these interactions,
all of which have been clearly demonstrated by experiments:

- Electric charges attract or repel one another with a force inversely
  proportional to the square of the distance between them: unlike charges
  attract, like ones repel.
- Magnetic poles (or states of polarization at individual points) attract
  or repel one another in a similar way and always come in pairs: every
  north pole is yoked to a south pole.
- An electric current inside a wire creates a corresponding circular
  magnetic field outside the wire. Its direction (clockwise or
  counter-clockwise) depends on the direction of the current in the wire.
- A current is induced in a loop of wire when it is moved towards or away
  from a magnetic field, or a magnet is moved towards or away from it, the
  direction of current depending on that of the movement.

While preparing for an evening lecture on 21 April 1820, Hans Christian
Ørsted made a surprising observation. As he was setting up his materials,
he noticed a compass needle deflected away from magnetic north when the
electric current from the battery he was using was switched on and off.
This deflection convinced him that magnetic fields radiate from all sides
of a wire carrying an electric current, just as light and heat do, and that
it confirmed a direct relationship between electricity and magnetism.

At the time of discovery, Ørsted did not suggest any satisfactory
explanation of the phenomenon, nor did he try to represent the phenomenon
in a mathematical framework. However, three months later he began more
intensive investigations. Soon thereafter he published his findings,
proving that an electric current produces a magnetic field as it flows
through a wire. The CGS unit of magnetic induction (oersted) is named in
honor of his contributions to the field of electromagnetism.

His findings resulted in intensive research throughout the scientific
community in electrodynamics. They influenced French physicist André-Marie
Ampère's developments of a single mathematical form to represent the
magnetic forces between current-carrying conductors. Ørsted's discovery
also represented a major step toward a unified concept of energy.

This unification, which was observed by Michael Faraday, extended by James
Clerk Maxwell, and partially reformulated by Oliver Heaviside and Heinrich
Hertz, is one of the key accomplishments of 19th century mathematical
physics. It had far-reaching consequences, one of which was the
understanding of the nature of light. Unlike what was proposed in
Electromagnetism, light and other electromagnetic waves are at the present
seen as taking the form of quantized, self-propagating oscillatory
electromagnetic field disturbances which have been called photons.
Different frequencies of oscillation give rise to the different forms of
electromagnetic radiation, from radio waves at the lowest frequencies, to
visible light at intermediate frequencies, to gamma rays at the highest
frequencies.

Ørsted was not the only person to examine the relationship between
electricity and magnetism. In 1802, Gian Domenico Romagnosi, an Italian
legal scholar, deflected a magnetic needle using electrostatic charges.
Actually, no galvanic current existed in the setup and hence no
electromagnetism was present. An account of the discovery was published in
1802 in an Italian newspaper, but it was largely overlooked by the
contemporary scientific community.²

Fundamental forces

The electromagnetic force is one of the four known fundamental forces. The
other fundamental forces are:

- the weak nuclear force, which binds to all known particles in the
  Standard Model, and causes certain forms of radioactive decay. (In
  particle physics though, the electroweak interaction is the unified
  description of two of the four known fundamental interactions of nature:
  electromagnetism and the weak interaction);
- the strong nuclear force, which binds quarks to form nucleons, and binds
  nucleons to form nuclei
- the gravitational force.

All other forces (e.g., friction) are derived from these four fundamental
forces (including momentum which is carried by the movement of particles).

The electromagnetic force is the one responsible for practically all the
phenomena one encounters in daily life above the nuclear scale, with the
exception of gravity. Roughly speaking, all the forces involved in
interactions between atoms can be explained by the electromagnetic force
acting on the electrically charged atomic nuclei and electrons inside and
around the atoms, together with how these particles carry momentum by their
movement. This includes the forces we experience in "pushing" or "pulling"
ordinary material objects, which come from the intermolecular forces
between the individual molecules in our bodies and those in the objects. It
also includes all forms of chemical phenomena.

A necessary part of understanding the intra-atomic to intermolecular forces
is the effective force generated by the momentum of the electrons'
movement, and that electrons move between interacting atoms, carrying
momentum with them. As a collection of electrons becomes more confined,
their minimum momentum necessarily increases due to the Pauli exclusion
principle. The behaviour of matter at the molecular scale including its
density is determined by the balance between the electromagnetic force and
the force generated by the exchange of momentum carried by the electrons
themselves.

Classical electrodynamics

Main article: Classical electrodynamics

The scientist William Gilbert proposed, in his De Magnete (1600), that
electricity and magnetism, while both capable of causing attraction and
repulsion of objects, were distinct effects. Mariners had noticed that
lightning strikes had the ability to disturb a compass needle, but the link
between lightning and electricity was not confirmed until Benjamin
Franklin's proposed experiments in 1752. One of the first to discover and
publish a link between man-made electric current and magnetism was
Romagnosi, who in 1802 noticed that connecting a wire across a voltaic pile
deflected a nearby compass needle. However, the effect did not become
widely known until 1820, when Ørsted performed a similar experiment.³
Ørsted's work influenced Ampère to produce a theory of electromagnetism
that set the subject on a mathematical foundation.

A theory of electromagnetism, known as classical electromagnetism, was
developed by various physicists over the course of the 19th century,
culminating in the work of James Clerk Maxwell, who unified the preceding
developments into a single theory and discovered the electromagnetic nature
of light. In classical electromagnetism, the electromagnetic field obeys a
set of equations known as Maxwell's equations, and the electromagnetic
force is given by the Lorentz force law.

One of the peculiarities of classical electromagnetism is that it is
difficult to reconcile with classical mechanics, but it is compatible with
special relativity. According to Maxwell's equations, the speed of light in
a vacuum is a universal constant, dependent only on the electrical
permittivity and magnetic permeability of free space. This violates
Galilean invariance, a long-standing cornerstone of classical mechanics.
One way to reconcile the two theories (electromagnetism and classical
mechanics) is to assume the existence of a luminiferous aether through
which the light propagates. However, subsequent experimental efforts failed
to detect the presence of the aether. After important contributions of
Hendrik Lorentz and Henri Poincaré, in 1905, Albert Einstein solved the
problem with the introduction of special relativity, which replaces
classical kinematics with a new theory of kinematics that is compatible
with classical electromagnetism. (For more information, see History of
special relativity.)

In addition, relativity theory shows that in moving frames of reference a
magnetic field transforms to a field with a nonzero electric component and
vice versa; thus firmly showing that they are two sides of the same coin,
and thus the term "electromagnetism". (For more information, see Classical
electromagnetism and special relativity and Covariant formulation of
classical electromagnetism.

Quantum mechanics

Photoelectric effect

Main article: Photoelectric effect

In another paper published in 1905, Albert Einstein undermined the very
foundations of classical electromagnetism. In his theory of the
photoelectric effect (for which he won the Nobel prize in physics) and
inspired by the idea of Max Planck's "quanta", he posited that light could
exist in discrete particle-like quantities as well, which later came to be
known as photons. Einstein's theory of the photoelectric effect extended
the insights that appeared in the solution of the ultraviolet catastrophe
presented by Max Planck in 1900. In his work, Planck showed that hot
objects emit electromagnetic radiation in discrete packets ("quanta"),
which leads to a finite total energy emitted as black body radiation. Both
of these results were in direct contradiction with the classical view of
light as a continuous wave. Planck's and Einstein's theories were
progenitors of quantum mechanics, which, when formulated in 1925,
necessitated the invention of a quantum theory of electromagnetism. This
theory, completed in the 1940s-1950s, is known as quantum electrodynamics
(or "QED"), and, in situations where perturbation theory is applicable, is
one of the most accurate theories known to physics.

Quantum electrodynamics

Main article: Quantum electrodynamics

All electromagnetic phenomena are underpinned by quantum mechanics,
specifically by quantum electrodynamics (which includes classical
electrodynamics as a limiting case) and this accounts for almost all
physical phenomena observable to the unaided human senses, including light
and other electromagnetic radiation, all of chemistry, most of mechanics
(excepting gravitation), and, of course, magnetism and electricity.

Electroweak interaction

Main article: Electroweak interaction

The electroweak interaction is the unified description of two of the four
known fundamental interactions of nature: electromagnetism and the weak
interaction. Although these two forces appear very different at everyday
low energies, the theory models them as two different aspects of the same
force. Above the unification energy, on the order of 100 GeV, they would
merge into a single electroweak force. Thus if the universe is hot enough
(approximately 10¹⁵ K, a temperature exceeded until shortly after the Big
Bang) then the electromagnetic force and weak force merge into a combined
electroweak force. During the electroweak epoch, the electroweak force
separated from the strong force. During the quark epoch, the electroweak
force split into the electromagnetic and weak force.

Quantities and units

See also: List of physical quantities and List of electromagnetism
equations

Electromagnetic units are part of a system of electrical units based
primarily upon the magnetic properties of electric currents, the
fundamental SI unit being the ampere. The units are:

- ampere (electric current)
- coulomb (electric charge)
- farad (capacitance)
- henry (inductance)
- ohm (resistance)
- tesla (magnetic flux density)
- volt (electric potential)
- watt (power)
- weber (magnetic flux)

In the electromagnetic cgs system, electric current is a fundamental
quantity defined via Ampère's law and takes the permeability as a
dimensionless quantity (relative permeability) whose value in a vacuum is
unity. As a consequence, the square of the speed of light appears
explicitly in some of the equations interrelating quantities in this
system.

Formulas for physical laws of electromagnetism (such as Maxwell's
equations) need to be adjusted depending on what system of units one uses.
This is because there is no one-to-one correspondence between
electromagnetic units in SI and those in CGS, as is the case for mechanical
units. Furthermore, within CGS, there are several plausible choices of
electromagnetic units, leading to different unit "sub-systems", including
Gaussian, "ESU", "EMU", and Heaviside–Lorentz. Among these choices,
Gaussian units are the most common today, and in fact the phrase "CGS
units" is often used to refer specifically to CGS-Gaussian units.

Electron

For other uses, see Electron (disambiguation).

The electron is a subatomic particle, symbol e− or β−, with a negative
elementary electric charge.⁷ Electrons belong to the first generation of
the lepton particle family,⁸ and are generally thought to be elementary
particles because they have no known components or substructure.¹ The
electron has a mass that is approximately 1/1836 that of the proton.⁹
Quantum mechanical properties of the electron include an intrinsic angular
momentum (spin) of a half-integer value in units of ħ, which means that it
is a fermion. Being fermions, no two electrons can occupy the same quantum
state, in accordance with the Pauli exclusion principle.⁸ Like all matter,
electrons have properties of both particles and waves, and so can collide
with other particles and can be diffracted like light. The wave properties
of electrons are easier to observe with experiments than those of other
particles like neutrons and protons because electrons have a lower mass and
hence a higher De Broglie wavelength for typical energies.

Many physical phenomena involve electrons in an essential role, such as
electricity, magnetism, and thermal conductivity, and they also participate
in gravitational, electromagnetic and weak interactions.¹⁰ An electron
generates an electric field surrounding it. An electron moving relative to
an observer generates a magnetic field. External magnetic fields deflect an
electron. Electrons radiate or absorb energy in the form of photons when
accelerated. Laboratory instruments are capable of containing and observing
individual electrons as well as electron plasma using electromagnetic
fields, whereas dedicated telescopes can detect electron plasma in outer
space. Electrons have many applications, including electronics, welding,
cathode ray tubes, electron microscopes, radiation therapy, lasers, gaseous
ionization detectors and particle accelerators.

Interactions involving electrons and other subatomic particles are of
interest in fields such as chemistry and nuclear physics. The Coulomb force
interaction between positive protons inside atomic nuclei and negative
electrons composes atoms. Ionization or changes in the proportions of
particles changes the binding energy of the system. The exchange or sharing
of the electrons between two or more atoms is the main cause of chemical
bonding.¹¹ British natural philosopher Richard Laming first hypothesized
the concept of an indivisible quantity of electric charge to explain the
chemical properties of atoms in 1838;³ Irish physicist George Johnstone
Stoney named this charge 'electron' in 1891, and J. J. Thomson and his team
of British physicists identified it as a particle in 1897.⁵ ¹² ¹³ Electrons
can also participate in nuclear reactions, such as nucleosynthesis in
stars, where they are known as beta particles. Electrons may be created
through beta decay of radioactive isotopes and in high-energy collisions,
for instance when cosmic rays enter the atmosphere. The antiparticle of the
electron is called the positron; it is identical to the electron except
that it carries electrical and other charges of the opposite sign. When an
electron collides with a positron, both particles may be totally
annihilated, producing gamma ray photons.

History

The ancient Greeks noticed that amber attracted small objects when rubbed
with fur. Along with lightning, this phenomenon is one of humanity's
earliest recorded experiences with electricity.¹⁴ In his 1600 treatise De
Magnete, the English scientist William Gilbert coined the New Latin term
electricus, to refer to this property of attracting small objects after
being rubbed.¹⁵ Both electric and electricity are derived from the Latin
ēlectrum (also the root of the alloy of the same name), which came from the
Greek word for amber, ἤλεκτρον (ēlektron).

In the early 1700s, Francis Hauksbee and French chemist Charles François de
Fay independently discovered what they believed were two kinds of
frictional electricity—one generated from rubbing glass, the other from
rubbing resin. From this, Du Fay theorized that electricity consists of two
electrical fluids, vitreous and resinous, that are separated by friction,
and that neutralize each other when combined.¹⁶ A decade later Benjamin
Franklin proposed that electricity was not from different types of
electrical fluid, but the same electrical fluid under different pressures.
He gave them the modern charge nomenclature of positive and negative
respectively.¹⁷ Franklin thought of the charge carrier as being positive,
but he did not correctly identify which situation was a surplus of the
charge carrier, and which situation was a deficit.¹⁸

Between 1838 and 1851, British natural philosopher Richard Laming developed
the idea that an atom is composed of a core of matter surrounded by
subatomic particles that had unit electric charges.² Beginning in 1846,
German physicist William Weber theorized that electricity was composed of
positively and negatively charged fluids, and their interaction was
governed by the inverse square law. After studying the phenomenon of
electrolysis in 1874, Irish physicist George Johnstone Stoney suggested
that there existed a "single definite quantity of electricity", the charge
of a monovalent ion. He was able to estimate the value of this elementary
charge e by means of Faraday's laws of electrolysis.¹⁹ However, Stoney
believed these charges were permanently attached to atoms and could not be
removed. In 1881, German physicist Hermann von Helmholtz argued that both
positive and negative charges were divided into elementary parts, each of
which "behaves like atoms of electricity".³

Stoney initially coined the term electrolion in 1881. Ten years later, he
switched to electron to describe these elementary charges, writing in 1894:
"... an estimate was made of the actual amount of this most remarkable
fundamental unit of electricity, for which I have since ventured to suggest
the name electron". A 1906 proposal to change to electrion failed because
Hendrik Lorentz preferred to keep electron.²⁰ ²¹ The word electron is a
combination of the words electric and ion.²² The suffix -on which is now
used to designate other subatomic particles, such as a proton or neutron,
is in turn derived from electron.²³ ²⁴

Discovery

The German physicist Johann Wilhelm Hittorf studied electrical conductivity
in rarefied gases: in 1869, he discovered a glow emitted from the cathode
that increased in size with decrease in gas pressure. In 1876, the German
physicist Eugen Goldstein showed that the rays from this glow cast a
shadow, and he dubbed the rays cathode rays.²⁶ During the 1870s, the
English chemist and physicist Sir William Crookes developed the first
cathode ray tube to have a high vacuum inside.²⁷ He then showed that the
luminescence rays appearing within the tube carried energy and moved from
the cathode to the anode. Furthermore, by applying a magnetic field, he was
able to deflect the rays, thereby demonstrating that the beam behaved as
though it were negatively charged.²⁸ ²⁹ In 1879, he proposed that these
properties could be explained by what he termed 'radiant matter'. He
suggested that this was a fourth state of matter, consisting of negatively
charged molecules that were being projected with high velocity from the
cathode.³⁰

The German-born British physicist Arthur Schuster expanded upon Crookes'
experiments by placing metal plates parallel to the cathode rays and
applying an electric potential between the plates. The field deflected the
rays toward the positively charged plate, providing further evidence that
the rays carried negative charge. By measuring the amount of deflection for
a given level of current, in 1890 Schuster was able to estimate the
charge-to-mass ratio of the ray components. However, this produced a value
that was more than a thousand times greater than what was expected, so
little credence was given to his calculations at the time.²⁸ ³¹

In 1892 Hendrik Lorentz suggested that the mass of these particles
(electrons) could be a consequence of their electric charge.³²

In 1896, the British physicist J. J. Thomson, with his colleagues John S.
Townsend and H. A. Wilson,¹² performed experiments indicating that cathode
rays really were unique particles, rather than waves, atoms or molecules as
was believed earlier.⁵ Thomson made good estimates of both the charge e and
the mass m, finding that cathode ray particles, which he called
"corpuscles," had perhaps one thousandth of the mass of the least massive
ion known: hydrogen.⁵ ¹³ He showed that their charge to mass ratio, e/m,
was independent of cathode material. He further showed that the negatively
charged particles produced by radioactive materials, by heated materials
and by illuminated materials were universal.⁵ ³³ The name electron was
again proposed for these particles by the Irish physicist George F.
Fitzgerald, and the name has since gained universal acceptance.²⁸

While studying naturally fluorescing minerals in 1896, the French physicist
Henri Becquerel discovered that they emitted radiation without any exposure
to an external energy source. These radioactive materials became the
subject of much interest by scientists, including the New Zealand physicist
Ernest Rutherford who discovered they emitted particles. He designated
these particles alpha and beta, on the basis of their ability to penetrate
matter.³⁴ In 1900, Becquerel showed that the beta rays emitted by radium
could be deflected by an electric field, and that their mass-to-charge
ratio was the same as for cathode rays.³⁵ This evidence strengthened the
view that electrons existed as components of atoms.³⁶ ³⁷

The electron's charge was more carefully measured by the American
physicists Robert Millikan and Harvey Fletcher in their oil-drop experiment
of 1909, the results of which were published in 1911. This experiment used
an electric field to prevent a charged droplet of oil from falling as a
result of gravity. This device could measure the electric charge from as
few as 1–150 ions with an error margin of less than 0.3%. Comparable
experiments had been done earlier by Thomson's team,⁵ using clouds of
charged water droplets generated by electrolysis,¹² and in 1911 by Abram
Ioffe, who independently obtained the same result as Millikan using charged
microparticles of metals, then published his results in 1913.³⁸ However,
oil drops were more stable than water drops because of their slower
evaporation rate, and thus more suited to precise experimentation over
longer periods of time.³⁹

Around the beginning of the twentieth century, it was found that under
certain conditions a fast-moving charged particle caused a condensation of
supersaturated water vapor along its path. In 1911, Charles Wilson used
this principle to devise his cloud chamber so he could photograph the
tracks of charged particles, such as fast-moving electrons.⁴⁰

Atomic theory

See also: The proton–electron model of the nucleus

By 1914, experiments by physicists Ernest Rutherford, Henry Moseley, James
Franck and Gustav Hertz had largely established the structure of an atom as
a dense nucleus of positive charge surrounded by lower-mass electrons.⁴¹ In
1913, Danish physicist Niels Bohr postulated that electrons resided in
quantized energy states, with the energy determined by the angular momentum
of the electron's orbits about the nucleus. The electrons could move
between these states, or orbits, by the emission or absorption of photons
at specific frequencies. By means of these quantized orbits, he accurately
explained the spectral lines of the hydrogen atom.⁴² However, Bohr's model
failed to account for the relative intensities of the spectral lines and it
was unsuccessful in explaining the spectra of more complex atoms.⁴¹

Chemical bonds between atoms were explained by Gilbert Newton Lewis, who in
1916 proposed that a covalent bond between two atoms is maintained by a
pair of electrons shared between them.⁴³ Later, in 1927, Walter Heitler and
Fritz London gave the full explanation of the electron-pair formation and
chemical bonding in terms of quantum mechanics.⁴⁴ In 1919, the American
chemist Irving Langmuir elaborated on the Lewis' static model of the atom
and suggested that all electrons were distributed in successive "concentric
(nearly) spherical shells, all of equal thickness".⁴⁵ The shells were, in
turn, divided by him in a number of cells each containing one pair of
electrons. With this model Langmuir was able to qualitatively explain the
chemical properties of all elements in the periodic table,⁴⁴ which were
known to largely repeat themselves according to the periodic law.⁴⁶

In 1924, Austrian physicist Wolfgang Pauli observed that the shell-like
structure of the atom could be explained by a set of four parameters that
defined every quantum energy state, as long as each state was inhabited by
no more than a single electron. (This prohibition against more than one
electron occupying the same quantum energy state became known as the Pauli
exclusion principle.)⁴⁷ The physical mechanism to explain the fourth
parameter, which had two distinct possible values, was provided by the
Dutch physicists Samuel Goudsmit and George Uhlenbeck. In 1925, Goudsmit
and Uhlenbeck suggested that an electron, in addition to the angular
momentum of its orbit, possesses an intrinsic angular momentum and magnetic
dipole moment.⁴¹ ⁴⁸ The intrinsic angular momentum became known as spin,
and explained the previously mysterious splitting of spectral lines
observed with a high-resolution spectrograph; this phenomenon is known as
fine structure splitting.⁴⁹

Quantum mechanics

See also: History of quantum mechanics

In his 1924 dissertation Recherches sur la théorie des quanta (Research on
Quantum Theory), French physicist Louis de Broglie hypothesized that all
matter possesses a de Broglie wave similar to light.⁵⁰ That is, under the
appropriate conditions, electrons and other matter would show properties of
either particles or waves. The corpuscular properties of a particle are
demonstrated when it is shown to have a localized position in space along
its trajectory at any given moment.⁵¹ Wave-like nature is observed, for
example, when a beam of light is passed through parallel slits and creates
interference patterns. In 1927, the interference effect was found in a beam
of electrons by English physicist George Paget Thomson with a thin metal
film and by American physicists Clinton Davisson and Lester Germer using a
crystal of nickel.⁵²

De Broglie's prediction of a wave nature for electrons led Erwin
Schrödinger to postulate a wave equation for electrons moving under the
influence of the nucleus in the atom. In 1926, this equation, the
Schrödinger equation, successfully described how electron waves
propagated.⁵³ Rather than yielding a solution that determined the location
of an electron over time, this wave equation also could be used to predict
the probability of finding an electron near a position, especially a
position near where the electron was bound in space, for which the electron
wave equations did not change in time. This approach led to a second
formulation of quantum mechanics (the first being by Heisenberg in 1925),
and solutions of Schrödinger's equation, like Heisenberg's, provided
derivations of the energy states of an electron in a hydrogen atom that
were equivalent to those that had been derived first by Bohr in 1913, and
that were known to reproduce the hydrogen spectrum.⁵⁴ Once spin and the
interaction between multiple electrons were considered, quantum mechanics
later made it possible to predict the configuration of electrons in atoms
with higher atomic numbers than hydrogen.⁵⁵

In 1928, building on Wolfgang Pauli's work, Paul Dirac produced a model of
the electron – the Dirac equation, consistent with relativity theory, by
applying relativistic and symmetry considerations to the hamiltonian
formulation of the quantum mechanics of the electro-magnetic field.⁵⁶ To
resolve some problems within his relativistic equation, in 1930 Dirac
developed a model of the vacuum as an infinite sea of particles having
negative energy, which was dubbed the Dirac sea. This led him to predict
the existence of a positron, the antimatter counterpart of the electron.⁵⁷
This particle was discovered in 1932 by Carl Anderson, who proposed calling
standard electrons negatrons, and using electron as a generic term to
describe both the positively and negatively charged variants.

In 1947 Willis Lamb, working in collaboration with graduate student Robert
Retherford, found that certain quantum states of hydrogen atom, which
should have the same energy, were shifted in relation to each other, the
difference being the Lamb shift. About the same time, Polykarp Kusch,
working with Henry M. Foley, discovered the magnetic moment of the electron
is slightly larger than predicted by Dirac's theory. This small difference
was later called anomalous magnetic dipole moment of the electron. This
difference was later explained by the theory of quantum electrodynamics,
developed by Sin-Itiro Tomonaga, Julian Schwinger andRichard Feynman in the
late 1940s.⁵⁸

Particle accelerators

With the development of the particle accelerator during the first half of
the twentieth century, physicists began to delve deeper into the properties
of subatomic particles.⁵⁹ The first successful attempt to accelerate
electrons using electromagnetic induction was made in 1942 by Donald Kerst.
His initial betatron reached energies of 2.3 MeV, while subsequent
betatrons achieved 300 MeV. In 1947, synchrotron radiation was discovered
with a 70 MeV electron synchrotron at General Electric. This radiation was
caused by the acceleration of electrons, moving near the speed of light,
through a magnetic field.⁶⁰

With a beam energy of 1.5 GeV, the first high-energy particle collider was
ADONE, which began operations in 1968.⁶¹ This device accelerated electrons
and positrons in opposite directions, effectively doubling the energy of
their collision when compared to striking a static target with an
electron.⁶² The Large Electron–Positron Collider (LEP) at CERN, which was
operational from 1989 to 2000, achieved collision energies of 209 GeV and
made important measurements for the Standard Model of particle physics.⁶³
⁶⁴

Confinement of individual electrons

Individual electrons can now be easily confined in ultra small (L = 20 nm,
W = 20 nm) CMOS transistors operated at cryogenic temperature over a range
of −269 °C (4 K) to about −258 °C (15 K).⁶⁵ The electron wavefunction
spreads in a semiconductor lattice and negligibly interacts with the
valence band electrons, so it can be treated in the single particle
formalism, by replacing its mass with the effective mass tensor.

Characteristics

Classification

In the Standard Model of particle physics, electrons belong to the group of
subatomic particles called leptons, which are believed to be fundamental or
elementary particles. Electrons have the lowest mass of any charged lepton
(or electrically charged particle of any type) and belong to the
first-generation of fundamental particles.⁶⁶ The second and third
generation contain charged leptons, the muon and the tau, which are
identical to the electron in charge, spin and interactions, but are more
massive. Leptons differ from the other basic constituent of matter, the
quarks, by their lack of strong interaction. All members of the lepton
group are fermions, because they all have half-odd integer spin; the
electron has spin ¹⁄₂.⁶⁷

Fundamental properties

The invariant mass of an electron is approximately 9.109×10−31 kilograms,⁶⁸
or 5.489×10−4 atomic mass units. On the basis of Einstein's principle of
mass–energy equivalence, this mass corresponds to a rest energy of 0.511
MeV. The ratio between the mass of a proton and that of an electron is
about 1836.⁹ ⁶⁹ Astronomical measurements show that the proton-to-electron
mass ratio has held the same value for at least half the age of the
universe, as is predicted by the Standard Model.⁷⁰

Electrons have an electric charge of −1.602×10−19 coulomb,⁶⁸ which is used
as a standard unit of charge for subatomic particles, and is also called
the elementary charge. This elementary charge has a relative standard
uncertainty of 2.2×10−8.⁶⁸ Within the limits of experimental accuracy, the
electron charge is identical to the charge of a proton, but with the
opposite sign.⁷¹ As the symbol e is used for the elementary charge, the
electron is commonly symbolized by e−, where the minus sign indicates the
negative charge. The positron is symbolized by e+ because it has the same
properties as the electron but with a positive rather than negative
charge.⁶⁷ ⁶⁸

The electron has an intrinsic angular momentum or spin of ¹⁄₂.⁶⁸ This
property is usually stated by referring to the electron as a spin-¹⁄₂
particle.⁶⁷ For such particles the spin magnitude is √3⁄₂ ħ.[note 3] while
the result of the measurement of a projection of the spin on any axis can
only be ±ħ⁄₂. In addition to spin, the electron has an intrinsic magnetic
moment along its spin axis.⁶⁸ It is approximately equal to one Bohr
magneton,⁷² [note 4] which is a physical constant equal to
9.27400915(23)×10−24 joules per tesla.⁶⁸ The orientation of the spin with
respect to the momentum of the electron defines the property of elementary
particles known as helicity.⁷³

The electron has no known substructure.¹ ⁷⁴ and it is assumed to be a point
particle with a point charge and no spatial extent.⁸ In classical physics,
the angular momentum and magnetic moment of an object depend upon its
physical dimensions. Hence, the concept of a dimensionless electron
possessing these properties might seem paradoxical and inconsistent to
experimental observations in Penning traps which point to finite non-zero
radius of the electron. A possible explanation of this paradoxical
situation is given below in the "Virtual particles" subsection by taking
into consideration the Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation. The issue of the
radius of the electron is a challenging problem of the modern theoretical
physics. The admission of the hypothesis of a finite radius of the electron
is incompatible to the premises of the theory of relativity. On the other
hand, a point-like electron (zero radius) generates serious mathematical
difficulties due to the self-energy of the electron tending to infinity.⁷⁵
These aspects have been analyzed in detail by Dmitri Ivanenko and Arseny
Sokolov.

Observation of a single electron in a Penning trap shows the upper limit of
the particle's radius is 10−22 meters.⁷⁶ There is a physical constant
called the "classical electron radius", with the much larger value of
2.8179×10−15 m, greater than the radius of the proton. However, the
terminology comes from a simplistic calculation that ignores the effects of
quantum mechanics; in reality, the so-called classical electron radius has
little to do with the true fundamental structure of the electron.⁷⁷ [note
5]

There are elementary particles that spontaneously decay into less massive
particles. An example is the muon, which decays into an electron, a
neutrino and an antineutrino, with a mean lifetime of 2.2×10−6 seconds.
However, the electron is thought to be stable on theoretical grounds: the
electron is the least massive particle with non-zero electric charge, so
its decay would violate charge conservation.⁷⁸ The experimental lower bound
for the electron's mean lifetime is 4.6×10²⁶ years, at a 90% confidence
level.⁷⁹ ⁸⁰

Quantum properties

As with all particles, electrons can act as waves. This is called the
wave–particle duality and can be demonstrated using the double-slit
experiment.

The wave-like nature of the electron allows it to pass through two parallel
slits simultaneously, rather than just one slit as would be the case for a
classical particle. In quantum mechanics, the wave-like property of one
particle can be described mathematically as a complex-valued function, the
wave function, commonly denoted by the Greek letter psi (ψ). When the
absolute value of this function is squared, it gives the probability that a
particle will be observed near a location—a probability density.⁸¹ :162–218

Electrons are identical particles because they cannot be distinguished from
each other by their intrinsic physical properties. In quantum mechanics,
this means that a pair of interacting electrons must be able to swap
positions without an observable change to the state of the system. The wave
function of fermions, including electrons, is antisymmetric, meaning that
it changes sign when two electrons are swapped; that is, ψ(r₁, r₂) = −ψ(r₂,
r₁), where the variables r₁ and r₂ correspond to the first and second
electrons, respectively. Since the absolute value is not changed by a sign
swap, this corresponds to equal probabilities. Bosons, such as the photon,
have symmetric wave functions instead.⁸¹ :162–218

In the case of antisymmetry, solutions of the wave equation for interacting
electrons result in a zero probability that each pair will occupy the same
location or state. This is responsible for the Pauli exclusion principle,
which precludes any two electrons from occupying the same quantum state.
This principle explains many of the properties of electrons. For example,
it causes groups of bound electrons to occupy different orbitals in an
atom, rather than all overlapping each other in the same orbit.⁸¹ :162–218

Virtual particles

Main article: Virtual particle

In a simplified picture, every photon spends some time as a combination of
a virtual electron plus its antiparticle, the virtual positron, which
rapidly annihilate each other shortly thereafter.⁸² The combination of the
energy variation needed to create these particles, and the time during
which they exist, fall under the threshold of detectability expressed by
the Heisenberg uncertainty relation, ΔE · Δt ≥ ħ. In effect, the energy
needed to create these virtual particles, ΔE, can be "borrowed" from the
vacuum for a period of time, Δt, so that their product is no more than the
reduced Planck constant, ħ ≈ 6.6×10−16 eV·s. Thus, for a virtual electron,
Δt is at most 1.3×10−21 s.⁸³

While an electron–positron virtual pair is in existence, the coulomb force
from the ambient electric field surrounding an electron causes a created
positron to be attracted to the original electron, while a created electron
experiences a repulsion. This causes what is called vacuum polarization. In
effect, the vacuum behaves like a medium having a dielectric permittivity
more than unity. Thus the effective charge of an electron is actually
smaller than its true value, and the charge decreases with increasing
distance from the electron.⁸⁴ ⁸⁵ This polarization was confirmed
experimentally in 1997 using the Japanese TRISTAN particle accelerator.⁸⁶
Virtual particles cause a comparable shielding effect for the mass of the
electron.⁸⁷

The interaction with virtual particles also explains the small (about 0.1%)
deviation of the intrinsic magnetic moment of the electron from the Bohr
magneton (the anomalous magnetic moment).⁷² ⁸⁸ The extraordinarily precise
agreement of this predicted difference with the experimentally determined
value is viewed as one of the great achievements of quantum
electrodynamics.⁸⁹

The apparent paradox (mentioned above in the properties subsection) of a
point particle electron having intrinsic angular momentum and magnetic
moment can be explained by the formation of virtual photons in the electric
field generated by the electron. These photons cause the electron to shift
about in a jittery fashion (known as zitterbewegung),⁹⁰ which results in a
net circular motion with precession. This motion produces both the spin and
the magnetic moment of the electron.⁸ ⁹¹ In atoms, this creation of virtual
photons explains the Lamb shift observed in spectral lines.⁸⁴

Interaction

An electron generates an electric field that exerts an attractive force on
a particle with a positive charge, such as the proton, and a repulsive
force on a particle with a negative charge. The strength of this force is
determined by Coulomb's inverse square law.⁹² When an electron is in
motion, it generates a magnetic field.⁸¹ :140 The Ampère-Maxwell law
relates the magnetic field to the mass motion of electrons (the current)
with respect to an observer. This property of induction supplies the
magnetic field that drives an electric motor.⁹³ The electromagnetic field
of an arbitrary moving charged particle is expressed by the
Liénard–Wiechert potentials, which are valid even when the particle's speed
is close to that of light (relativistic).

When an electron is moving through a magnetic field, it is subject to the
Lorentz force that acts perpendicularly to the plane defined by the
magnetic field and the electron velocity. This centripetal force causes the
electron to follow a helical trajectory through the field at a radius
called the gyroradius. The acceleration from this curving motion induces
the electron to radiate energy in the form of synchrotron radiation.⁸¹
:160⁹⁴ [note 6] The energy emission in turn causes a recoil of the
electron, known as the Abraham–Lorentz–Dirac Force, which creates a
friction that slows the electron. This force is caused by a back-reaction
of the electron's own field upon itself.⁹⁵

Photons mediate electromagnetic interactions between particles in quantum
electrodynamics. An isolated electron at a constant velocity cannot emit or
absorb a real photon; doing so would violate conservation of energy and
momentum. Instead, virtual photons can transfer momentum between two
charged particles. This exchange of virtual photons, for example, generates
the Coulomb force.⁹⁶ Energy emission can occur when a moving electron is
deflected by a charged particle, such as a proton. The acceleration of the
electron results in the emission of Bremsstrahlung radiation.⁹⁷

An inelastic collision between a photon (light) and a solitary (free)
electron is called Compton scattering. This collision results in a transfer
of momentum and energy between the particles, which modifies the wavelength
of the photon by an amount called the Compton shift.[note 7] The maximum
magnitude of this wavelength shift is h/mₑc, which is known as the Compton
wavelength.⁹⁸ For an electron, it has a value of 2.43×10−12 m.⁶⁸ When the
wavelength of the light is long (for instance, the wavelength of the
visible light is 0.4–0.7 μm) the wavelength shift becomes negligible. Such
interaction between the light and free electrons is called Thomson
scattering or Linear Thomson scattering.⁹⁹

The relative strength of the electromagnetic interaction between two
charged particles, such as an electron and a proton, is given by the
fine-structure constant. This value is a dimensionless quantity formed by
the ratio of two energies: the electrostatic energy of attraction (or
repulsion) at a separation of one Compton wavelength, and the rest energy
of the charge. It is given by α ≈ 7.297353×10−3, which is approximately
equal to ¹⁄₁₃₇.⁶⁸

When electrons and positrons collide, they annihilate each other, giving
rise to two or more gamma ray photons. If the electron and positron have
negligible momentum, a positronium atom can form before annihilation
results in two or three gamma ray photons totalling 1.022 MeV.¹⁰⁰ ¹⁰¹ On
the other hand, high-energy photons may transform into an electron and a
positron by a process called pair production, but only in the presence of a
nearby charged particle, such as a nucleus.¹⁰² ¹⁰³

In the theory of electroweak interaction, the left-handed component of
electron's wavefunction forms a weak isospin doublet with the electron
neutrino. This means that during weak interactions, electron neutrinos
behave like electrons. Either member of this doublet can undergo a charged
current interaction by emitting or absorbing a W and be converted into the
other member. Charge is conserved during this reaction because the W boson
also carries a charge, canceling out any net change during the
transmutation. Charged current interactions are responsible for the
phenomenon of beta decay in a radioactive atom. Both the electron and
electron neutrino can undergo a neutral current interaction via a Z0
exchange, and this is responsible for neutrino-electron elastic
scattering.¹⁰⁴

Atoms and molecules

Main article: Atom

An electron can be bound to the nucleus of an atom by the attractive
Coulomb force. A system of one or more electrons bound to a nucleus is
called an atom. If the number of electrons is different from the nucleus'
electrical charge, such an atom is called an ion. The wave-like behavior of
a bound electron is described by a function called an atomic orbital. Each
orbital has its own set of quantum numbers such as energy, angular momentum
and projection of angular momentum, and only a discrete set of these
orbitals exist around the nucleus. According to the Pauli exclusion
principle each orbital can be occupied by up to two electrons, which must
differ in their spin quantum number.

Electrons can transfer between different orbitals by the emission or
absorption of photons with an energy that matches the difference in
potential.¹⁰⁵ Other methods of orbital transfer include collisions with
particles, such as electrons, and the Auger effect.¹⁰⁶ To escape the atom,
the energy of the electron must be increased above its binding energy to
the atom. This occurs, for example, with the photoelectric effect, where an
incident photon exceeding the atom's ionization energy is absorbed by the
electron.¹⁰⁷

The orbital angular momentum of electrons is quantized. Because the
electron is charged, it produces an orbital magnetic moment that is
proportional to the angular momentum. The net magnetic moment of an atom is
equal to the vector sum of orbital and spin magnetic moments of all
electrons and the nucleus. The magnetic moment of the nucleus is negligible
compared with that of the electrons. The magnetic moments of the electrons
that occupy the same orbital (so called, paired electrons) cancel each
other out.¹⁰⁸

The chemical bond between atoms occurs as a result of electromagnetic
interactions, as described by the laws of quantum mechanics.¹⁰⁹ The
strongest bonds are formed by the sharing or transfer of electrons between
atoms, allowing the formation of molecules.¹¹ Within a molecule, electrons
move under the influence of several nuclei, and occupy molecular orbitals;
much as they can occupy atomic orbitals in isolated atoms.¹¹⁰ A fundamental
factor in these molecular structures is the existence of electron pairs.
These are electrons with opposed spins, allowing them to occupy the same
molecular orbital without violating the Pauli exclusion principle (much
like in atoms). Different molecular orbitals have different spatial
distribution of the electron density. For instance, in bonded pairs (i.e.
in the pairs that actually bind atoms together) electrons can be found with
the maximal probability in a relatively small volume between the nuclei. On
the contrary, in non-bonded pairs electrons are distributed in a large
volume around nuclei.¹¹¹

Conductivity

If a body has more or fewer electrons than are required to balance the
positive charge of the nuclei, then that object has a net electric charge.
When there is an excess of electrons, the object is said to be negatively
charged. When there are fewer electrons than the number of protons in
nuclei, the object is said to be positively charged. When the number of
electrons and the number of protons are equal, their charges cancel each
other and the object is said to be electrically neutral. A macroscopic body
can develop an electric charge through rubbing, by the triboelectric
effect.¹¹⁵

Independent electrons moving in vacuum are termed free electrons. Electrons
in metals also behave as if they were free. In reality the particles that
are commonly termed electrons in metals and other solids are
quasi-electrons—quasiparticles, which have the same electrical charge, spin
and magnetic moment as real electrons but may have a different mass.¹¹⁶
When free electrons—both in vacuum and metals—move, they produce a net flow
of charge called an electric current, which generates a magnetic field.
Likewise a current can be created by a changing magnetic field. These
interactions are described mathematically by Maxwell's equations.¹¹⁷

At a given temperature, each material has an electrical conductivity that
determines the value of electric current when an electric potential is
applied. Examples of good conductors include metals such as copper and
gold, whereas glass and Teflon are poor conductors. In any dielectric
material, the electrons remain bound to their respective atoms and the
material behaves as an insulator. Most semiconductors have a variable level
of conductivity that lies between the extremes of conduction and
insulation.¹¹⁸ On the other hand, metals have an electronic band structure
containing partially filled electronic bands. The presence of such bands
allows electrons in metals to behave as if they were free or delocalized
electrons. These electrons are not associated with specific atoms, so when
an electric field is applied, they are free to move like a gas (called
Fermi gas)¹¹⁹ through the material much like free electrons.

Because of collisions between electrons and atoms, the drift velocity of
electrons in a conductor is on the order of millimeters per second.
However, the speed at which a change of current at one point in the
material causes changes in currents in other parts of the material, the
velocity of propagation, is typically about 75% of light speed.¹²⁰ This
occurs because electrical signals propagate as a wave, with the velocity
dependent on the dielectric constant of the material.¹²¹

Metals make relatively good conductors of heat, primarily because the
delocalized electrons are free to transport thermal energy between atoms.
However, unlike electrical conductivity, the thermal conductivity of a
metal is nearly independent of temperature. This is expressed
mathematically by the Wiedemann–Franz law,¹¹⁹ which states that the ratio
of thermal conductivity to the electrical conductivity is proportional to
the temperature. The thermal disorder in the metallic lattice increases the
electrical resistivity of the material, producing a temperature dependence
for electric current.¹²²

When cooled below a point called the critical temperature, materials can
undergo a phase transition in which they lose all resistivity to electric
current, in a process known as superconductivity. In BCS theory, this
behavior is modeled by pairs of electrons entering a quantum state known as
a Bose–Einstein condensate. These Cooper pairs have their motion coupled to
nearby matter via lattice vibrations called phonons, thereby avoiding the
collisions with atoms that normally create electrical resistance.¹²³
(Cooper pairs have a radius of roughly 100 nm, so they can overlap each
other.)¹²⁴ However, the mechanism by which higher temperature
superconductors operate remains uncertain.

Electrons inside conducting solids, which are quasi-particles themselves,
when tightly confined at temperatures close to absolute zero, behave as
though they had split into three other quasiparticles: spinons, Orbitons
and holons.¹²⁵ ¹²⁶ The former carries spin and magnetic moment, the next
carries its orbital location while the latter electrical charge.

Motion and energy

According to Einstein's theory of special relativity, as an electron's
speed approaches the speed of light, from an observer's point of view its
relativistic mass increases, thereby making it more and more difficult to
accelerate it from within the observer's frame of reference. The speed of
an electron can approach, but never reach, the speed of light in a vacuum,
c. However, when relativistic electrons—that is, electrons moving at a
speed close to c—are injected into a dielectric medium such as water, where
the local speed of light is significantly less than c, the electrons
temporarily travel faster than light in the medium. As they interact with
the medium, they generate a faint light called Cherenkov radiation.¹²⁷

The effects of special relativity are based on a quantity known as the
Lorentz factor, defined as γ=1/ √( 1-{v²}/{c²} ) where v is the speed of
the particle. The kinetic energy Kₑ of an electron moving with velocity v
is:

\displaystyle K_{\mathrm{e} } = (γ- 1)m_{\mathrm{e} } c²,

where mₑ is the mass of electron. For example, the Stanford linear
accelerator can accelerate an electron to roughly 51 GeV.¹²⁸ Since an
electron behaves as a wave, at a given velocity it has a characteristic de
Broglie wavelength. This is given by λₑ = h/p where h is the Planck
constant and p is the momentum.⁵⁰ For the 51 GeV electron above, the
wavelength is about 2.4×10−17 m, small enough to explore structures well
below the size of an atomic nucleus.¹²⁹

Formation

The Big Bang theory is the most widely accepted scientific theory to
explain the early stages in the evolution of the Universe.¹³⁰ For the first
millisecond of the Big Bang, the temperatures were over 10 billion Kelvin
and photons had mean energies over a million electronvolts. These photons
were sufficiently energetic that they could react with each other to form
pairs of electrons and positrons. Likewise, positron-electron pairs
annihilated each other and emitted energetic photons:

  γ + γ ↔ e+ + e−

An equilibrium between electrons, positrons and photons was maintained
during this phase of the evolution of the Universe. After 15 seconds had
passed, however, the temperature of the universe dropped below the
threshold where electron-positron formation could occur. Most of the
surviving electrons and positrons annihilated each other, releasing gamma
radiation that briefly reheated the universe.¹³¹

For reasons that remain uncertain, during the process of leptogenesis there
was an excess in the number of electrons over positrons.¹³² Hence, about
one electron in every billion survived the annihilation process. This
excess matched the excess of protons over antiprotons, in a condition known
as baryon asymmetry, resulting in a net charge of zero for the universe.¹³³
¹³⁴ The surviving protons and neutrons began to participate in reactions
with each other—in the process known as nucleosynthesis, forming isotopes
of hydrogen and helium, with trace amounts of lithium. This process peaked
after about five minutes.¹³⁵ Any leftover neutrons underwent negative beta
decay with a half-life of about a thousand seconds, releasing a proton and
electron in the process,

  n → p + e− + ν
  e

For about the next 300000–400000 years, the excess electrons remained too
energetic to bind with atomic nuclei.¹³⁶ What followed is a period known as
recombination, when neutral atoms were formed and the expanding universe
became transparent to radiation.¹³⁷

Roughly one million years after the big bang, the first generation of stars
began to form.¹³⁷ Within a star, stellar nucleosynthesis results in the
production of positrons from the fusion of atomic nuclei. These antimatter
particles immediately annihilate with electrons, releasing gamma rays. The
net result is a steady reduction in the number of electrons, and a matching
increase in the number of neutrons. However, the process of stellar
evolution can result in the synthesis of radioactive isotopes. Selected
isotopes can subsequently undergo negative beta decay, emitting an electron
and antineutrino from the nucleus.¹³⁸ An example is the cobalt-60 (⁶⁰Co)
isotope, which decays to form nickel-60 (60Ni).¹³⁹

At the end of its lifetime, a star with more than about 20 solar masses can
undergo gravitational collapse to form a black hole.¹⁴⁰ According to
classical physics, these massive stellar objects exert a gravitational
attraction that is strong enough to prevent anything, even electromagnetic
radiation, from escaping past the Schwarzschild radius. However, quantum
mechanical effects are believed to potentially allow the emission of
Hawking radiation at this distance. Electrons (and positrons) are thought
to be created at the event horizon of these stellar remnants.

When pairs of virtual particles (such as an electron and positron) are
created in the vicinity of the event horizon, the random spatial
distribution of these particles may permit one of them to appear on the
exterior; this process is called quantum tunnelling. The gravitational
potential of the black hole can then supply the energy that transforms this
virtual particle into a real particle, allowing it to radiate away into
space.¹⁴¹ In exchange, the other member of the pair is given negative
energy, which results in a net loss of mass-energy by the black hole. The
rate of Hawking radiation increases with decreasing mass, eventually
causing the black hole to evaporate away until, finally, it explodes.¹⁴²

Cosmic rays are particles traveling through space with high energies.
Energy events as high as 3.0×10²⁰ eV have been recorded.¹⁴³ When these
particles collide with nucleons in the Earth's atmosphere, a shower of
particles is generated, including pions.¹⁴⁴ More than half of the cosmic
radiation observed from the Earth's surface consists of muons. The particle
called a muon is a lepton produced in the upper atmosphere by the decay of
a pion.

  π− → μ− + ν
  μ

A muon, in turn, can decay to form an electron or positron.¹⁴⁵

  μ− → e− + ν
  e + ν
  μ

Observation

Remote observation of electrons requires detection of their radiated
energy. For example, in high-energy environments such as the corona of a
star, free electrons form a plasma that radiates energy due to
Bremsstrahlung radiation. Electron gas can undergo plasma oscillation,
which is waves caused by synchronized variations in electron density, and
these produce energy emissions that can be detected by using radio
telescopes.¹⁴⁷

The frequency of a photon is proportional to its energy. As a bound
electron transitions between different energy levels of an atom, it absorbs
or emits photons at characteristic frequencies. For instance, when atoms
are irradiated by a source with a broad spectrum, distinct absorption lines
appear in the spectrum of transmitted radiation. Each element or molecule
displays a characteristic set of spectral lines, such as the hydrogen
spectral series. Spectroscopic measurements of the strength and width of
these lines allow the composition and physical properties of a substance to
be determined.¹⁴⁸ ¹⁴⁹

In laboratory conditions, the interactions of individual electrons can be
observed by means of particle detectors, which allow measurement of
specific properties such as energy, spin and charge.¹⁰⁷ The development of
the Paul trap and Penning trap allows charged particles to be contained
within a small region for long durations. This enables precise measurements
of the particle properties. For example, in one instance a Penning trap was
used to contain a single electron for a period of 10 months.¹⁵⁰ The
magnetic moment of the electron was measured to a precision of eleven
digits, which, in 1980, was a greater accuracy than for any other physical
constant.¹⁵¹

The first video images of an electron's energy distribution were captured
by a team at Lund University in Sweden, February 2008. The scientists used
extremely short flashes of light, called attosecond pulses, which allowed
an electron's motion to be observed for the first time.¹⁵² ¹⁵³

The distribution of the electrons in solid materials can be visualized by
angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). This technique employs
the photoelectric effect to measure the reciprocal space—a mathematical
representation of periodic structures that is used to infer the original
structure. ARPES can be used to determine the direction, speed and
scattering of electrons within the material.¹⁵⁴

Plasma applications

Particle beams

Electron beams are used in welding.¹⁵⁶ They allow energy densities up to
10⁷ W·cm−2 across a narrow focus diameter of 0.1–1.3 mm and usually require
no filler material. This welding technique must be performed in a vacuum to
prevent the electrons from interacting with the gas before reaching their
target, and it can be used to join conductive materials that would
otherwise be considered unsuitable for welding.¹⁵⁷ ¹⁵⁸

Electron-beam lithography (EBL) is a method of etching semiconductors at
resolutions smaller than a micrometer.¹⁵⁹ This technique is limited by high
costs, slow performance, the need to operate the beam in the vacuum and the
tendency of the electrons to scatter in solids. The last problem limits the
resolution to about 10 nm. For this reason, EBL is primarily used for the
production of small numbers of specialized integrated circuits.¹⁶⁰

Electron beam processing is used to irradiate materials in order to change
their physical properties or sterilize medical and food products.¹⁶¹
Electron beams fluidise or quasi-melt glasses without significant increase
of temperature on intensive irradiation: e.g. intensive electron radiation
causes a many orders of magnitude decrease of viscosity and stepwise
decrease of its activation energy.¹⁶²

Linear particle accelerators generate electron beams for treatment of
superficial tumors in radiation therapy. Electron therapy can treat such
skin lesions as basal-cell carcinomas because an electron beam only
penetrates to a limited depth before being absorbed, typically up to 5 cm
for electron energies in the range 5–20 MeV. An electron beam can be used
to supplement the treatment of areas that have been irradiated by
X-rays.¹⁶³ ¹⁶⁴

Particle accelerators use electric fields to propel electrons and their
antiparticles to high energies. These particles emit synchrotron radiation
as they pass through magnetic fields. The dependency of the intensity of
this radiation upon spin polarizes the electron beam—a process known as the
Sokolov–Ternov effect.[note 8] Polarized electron beams can be useful for
various experiments. Synchrotron radiation can also cool the electron beams
to reduce the momentum spread of the particles. Electron and positron beams
are collided upon the particles' accelerating to the required energies;
particle detectors observe the resulting energy emissions, which particle
physics studies .¹⁶⁵

Imaging

Low-energy electron diffraction (LEED) is a method of bombarding a
crystalline material with a collimated beam of electrons and then observing
the resulting diffraction patterns to determine the structure of the
material. The required energy of the electrons is typically in the range
20–200 eV.¹⁶⁶ The reflection high-energy electron diffraction (RHEED)
technique uses the reflection of a beam of electrons fired at various low
angles to characterize the surface of crystalline materials. The beam
energy is typically in the range 8–20 keV and the angle of incidence is
1–4°.¹⁶⁷ ¹⁶⁸

The electron microscope directs a focused beam of electrons at a specimen.
Some electrons change their properties, such as movement direction, angle,
and relative phase and energy as the beam interacts with the material.
Microscopists can record these changes in the electron beam to produce
atomically resolved images of the material.¹⁶⁹ In blue light, conventional
optical microscopes have a diffraction-limited resolution of about 200
nm.¹⁷⁰ By comparison, electron microscopes are limited by the de Broglie
wavelength of the electron. This wavelength, for example, is equal to
0.0037 nm for electrons accelerated across a 100,000-volt potential.¹⁷¹ The
Transmission Electron Aberration-Corrected Microscope is capable of
sub-0.05 nm resolution, which is more than enough to resolve individual
atoms.¹⁷² This capability makes the electron microscope a useful laboratory
instrument for high resolution imaging. However, electron microscopes are
expensive instruments that are costly to maintain.

Two main types of electron microscopes exist: transmission and scanning.
Transmission electron microscopes function like overhead projectors, with a
beam of electrons passing through a slice of material then being projected
by lenses on a photographic slide or a charge-coupled device. Scanning
electron microscopes rasteri a finely focused electron beam, as in a TV
set, across the studied sample to produce the image. Magnifications range
from 100× to 1,000,000× or higher for both microscope types. The scanning
tunneling microscope uses quantum tunneling of electrons from a sharp metal
tip into the studied material and can produce atomically resolved images of
its surface.¹⁷³ ¹⁷⁴ ¹⁷⁵

Other applications

In the free-electron laser (FEL), a relativistic electron beam passes
through a pair of undulators that contain arrays of dipole magnets whose
fields point in alternating directions. The electrons emit synchrotron
radiation that coherently interacts with the same electrons to strongly
amplify the radiation field at the resonance frequency. FEL can emit a
coherent high-brilliance electromagnetic radiation with a wide range of
frequencies, from microwaves to soft X-rays. These devices may find
manufacturing, communication and various medical applications, such as soft
tissue surgery.¹⁷⁶

Electrons are important in cathode ray tubes, which have been extensively
used as display devices in laboratory instruments, computer monitors and
television sets.¹⁷⁷ In a photomultiplier tube, every photon striking the
photocathode initiates an avalanche of electrons that produces a detectable
current pulse.¹⁷⁸ Vacuum tubes use the flow of electrons to manipulate
electrical signals, and they played a critical role in the development of
electronics technology. However, they have been largely supplanted by
solid-state devices such as the transistor.¹⁷⁹

[5] The classical electron radius is derived as follows. Assume that the
  electron's charge is spread uniformly throughout a spherical volume.
  Since one part of the sphere would repel the other parts, the sphere
  contains electrostatic potential energy. This energy is assumed to equal
  the electron's rest energy, defined by special relativity (E = mc²).
From electrostatics theory, the potential energy of a sphere with radius r
  and charge e is given by:E_{\mathrm p} = \frac{e²}{8πε₀ r} ,
where ε₀ is the vacuum permittivity. For an electron with rest mass m₀, the
  rest energy is equal to:\textstyle E_{\mathrm p} = m₀ c²,
where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. Setting them equal and solving
  for r gives the classical electron radius.

Energy

This article is about the scalar physical quantity. For an overview of and
topical guide to energy, see Outline of energy. For other uses, see Energy
(disambiguation).
"Energetic" redirects here. For other uses, see Energetic (disambiguation).

In physics, energy is a property of objects which can be transferred to
other objects or converted into different forms, but cannot be created or
destroyed. The "ability of a system to perform work" is a common
description, but it is difficult to give one single comprehensive
definition of energy because of its many forms.¹ For instance, in SI units,
energy is measured in joules, and one joule is defined "mechanically",
being the energy transferred to an object by the mechanical work of moving
it a distance of 1 metre against a force of 1 newton.[note 1] However,
there are many other definitions of energy, depending on the context, such
as thermal energy, radiant energy, electromagnetic, nuclear, etc., where
definitions are derived that are the most convenient.

Common energy forms include the kinetic energy of a moving object, the
radiant energy carried by light, the potential energy stored by an object's
position in a force field (gravitational, electric or magnetic), elastic
energy stored by stretching solid objects, chemical energy released when a
fuel burns, and the thermal energy due to an object's temperature. All of
the many forms of energy are convertible to other kinds of energy, and obey
the law of conservation of energy which says that energy can be neither
created nor be destroyed; however, it can change from one form to another.

For "closed systems" with no external source or sink of energy, the first
law of thermodynamics states that a system's energy is constant unless
energy is transferred in or out by mechanical work or heat, and that no
energy is lost in transfer. This means that it is impossible to create or
destroy energy. The second law of thermodynamics states that all systems
doing work always lose some energy as waste heat. This creates a limit to
the amount of energy that can do work by a heating process, a limit called
the available energy. Mechanical and other forms of energy can be
transformed in the other direction into thermal energy without such
limitations.² The total energy of a system can be calculated by adding up
all forms of energy in the system.

Examples of energy transformation include generating electric energy from
heat energy via a steam turbine, or lifting an object against gravity using
electrical energy driving a crane motor. Lifting against gravity performs
mechanical work on the object and stores gravitational potential energy In
the object. If the object falls to ground, gravity does mechanical work on
the object which transforms the potential energy in the gravitational field
to the kinetic energy released as heat on impact with the ground. Our Sun
transforms nuclear potential energy to other forms of energy; its total
mass does not decrease due to that in itself (since it still contains the
same total energy even if in different forms), but its mass does decrease
when the energy escapes out to its surroundings, largely as radiant energy.

Mass and energy are closely related. According to the theory of mass–energy
equivalence, any object that has mass when stationary in a frame of
reference (called rest mass) also has an equivalent amount of energy whose
form is called rest energy in that frame, and any additional energy
acquired by the object above that rest energy will increase an object's
mass. For example, if you had a sensitive enough scale, you could measure
an increase in mass after heating an object.

Living organisms require available energy to stay alive, such as the energy
humans get from food. Civilisation gets the energy it needs from energy
resources such as fossil fuels. The processes of Earth's climate and
ecosystem are driven by the radiant energy Earth receives from the sun and
the geothermal energy contained within the earth.

Forms

Main article: Forms of energy

The total energy of a system can be subdivided and classified in various
ways. For example, classical mechanics distinguishes between kinetic
energy, which is determined by an object's movement through space, and
potential energy, which is a function of the position of an object within a
field. It may also be convenient to distinguish gravitational energy,
thermal energy, several types of nuclear energy (which utilize potentials
from the nuclear force and the weak force), electric energy (from the
electric field), and magnetic energy (from the magnetic field), among
others. Many of these classifications overlap; for instance, thermal energy
usually consists partly of kinetic and partly of potential energy.

Some types of energy are a varying mix of both potential and kinetic
energy. An example is mechanical energy which is the sum of (usually
macroscopic) kinetic and potential energy in a system. Elastic energy in
materials is also dependent upon electrical potential energy (among atoms
and molecules), as is chemical energy, which is stored and released from a
reservoir of electrical potential energy between electrons, and the
molecules or atomic nuclei that attract them. .The list is also not
necessarily complete. Whenever physical scientists discover that a certain
phenomenon appears to violate the law of energy conservation, new forms are
typically added that account for the discrepancy.

Heat and work are special cases in that they are not properties of systems,
but are instead properties of processes that transfer energy. In general we
cannot measure how much heat or work are present in an object, but rather
only how much energy is transferred among objects in certain ways during
the occurrence of a given process. Heat and work are measured as positive
or negative depending on which side of the transfer we view them from.

Potential energies are often measured as positive or negative depending on
whether they are greater or less than the energy of a specified base state
or configuration such as two interacting bodies being infinitely far apart.
Wave energies (such as radiant or sound energy), kinetic energy, and rest
energy are each greater than or equal to zero because they are measured in
comparison to a base state of zero energy: "no wave", "no motion", and "no
inertia", respectively.

The distinctions between different kinds of energy is not always clear-cut.
As Richard Feynman points out:

  These notions of potential and kinetic energy depend on a notion of
  length scale. For example, one can speak of macroscopic potential and
  kinetic energy, which do not include thermal potential and kinetic
  energy. Also what is called chemical potential energy is a macroscopic
  notion, and closer examination shows that it is really the sum of the
  potential and kinetic energy on the atomic and subatomic scale. Similar
  remarks apply to nuclear "potential" energy and most other forms of
  energy. This dependence on length scale is non-problematic if the various
  length scales are decoupled, as is often the case ... but confusion can
  arise when different length scales are coupled, for instance when
  friction converts macroscopic work into microscopic thermal energy.

Some examples of different kinds of energy:

History

Main articles: History of energy and timeline of thermodynamics,
statistical mechanics, and random processes

The word energy derives from the Ancient Greek: ἐνέργεια energeia
"activity, operation",³ which possibly appears for the first time in the
work of Aristotle in the 4th century BC. In contrast to the modern
definition, energeia was a qualitative philosophical concept, broad enough
to include ideas such as happiness and pleasure.

In the late 17th century, Gottfried Leibniz proposed the idea of the Latin:
vis viva, or living force, which defined as the product of the mass of an
object and its velocity squared; he believed that total vis viva was
conserved. To account for slowing due to friction, Leibniz theorized that
thermal energy consisted of the random motion of the constituent parts of
matter, a view shared by Isaac Newton, although it would be more than a
century until this was generally accepted. The modern analog of this
property, kinetic energy, differs from vis viva only by a factor of two.

In 1807, Thomas Young was possibly the first to use the term "energy"
instead of vis viva, in its modern sense.⁴ Gustave-Gaspard Coriolis
described "kinetic energy" in 1829 in its modern sense, and in 1853,
William Rankine coined the term "potential energy". The law of conservation
of energy, was also first postulated in the early 19th century, and applies
to any isolated system. It was argued for some years whether heat was a
physical substance, dubbed the caloric, or merely a physical quantity, such
as momentum. In 1845 James Prescott Joule discovered the link between
mechanical work and the generation of heat.

These developments led to the theory of conservation of energy, formalized
largely by William Thomson (Lord Kelvin) as the field of thermodynamics.
Thermodynamics aided the rapid development of explanations of chemical
processes by Rudolf Clausius, Josiah Willard Gibbs, and Walther Nernst. It
also led to a mathematical formulation of the concept of entropy by
Clausius and to the introduction of laws of radiant energy by Jožef Stefan.
According to Noether's theorem, the conservation of energy is a consequence
of the fact that the laws of physics do not change over time.⁵ Thus, since
1918, theorists have understood that the law of conservation of energy is
the direct mathematical consequence of the translational symmetry of the
quantity conjugate to energy, namely time.

Units of measure

Main article: Units of energy

In 1843 James Prescott Joule independently discovered the mechanical
equivalent in a series of experiments. The most famous of them used the
"Joule apparatus": a descending weight, attached to a string, caused
rotation of a paddle immersed in water, practically insulated from heat
transfer. It showed that the gravitational potential energy lost by the
weight in descending was equal to the internal energy gained by the water
through friction with the paddle.

In the International System of Units (SI), the unit of energy is the joule,
named after James Prescott Joule. It is a derived unit. It is equal to the
energy expended (or work done) in applying a force of one newton through a
distance of one metre. However energy is also expressed in many other units
not part of the SI, such as ergs, calories, British Thermal Units,
kilowatt-hours and kilocalories, which require a conversion factor when
expressed in SI units.

The SI unit of energy rate (energy per unit time) is the watt, which is a
joule per second. Thus, one joule is one watt-second, and 3600 joules equal
one watt-hour. The CGS energy unit is the erg and the imperial and US
customary unit is the foot pound. Other energy units such as the
electronvolt, food calorie or thermodynamic kcal (based on the temperature
change of water in a heating process), and BTU are used in specific areas
of science and commerce.

Scientific use

Classical mechanics

Main articles: Mechanics, Mechanical work and Thermodynamics

In classical mechanics, energy is a conceptually and mathematically useful
property, as it is a conserved quantity. Several formulations of mechanics
have been developed using energy as a core concept.

Work, a form of energy, is force times distance.

W = ∫_C F ·\mathrm{d} s

This says that the work (W) is equal to the line integral of the force F
along a path C; for details see the mechanical work article. Work and thus
energy is frame dependent. For example, consider a ball being hit by a bat.
In the center-of-mass reference frame, the bat does no work on the ball.
But, in the reference frame of the person swinging the bat, considerable
work is done on the ball.

The total energy of a system is sometimes called the Hamiltonian, after
William Rowan Hamilton. The classical equations of motion can be written in
terms of the Hamiltonian, even for highly complex or abstract systems.
These classical equations have remarkably direct analogs in nonrelativistic
quantum mechanics.⁶

Another energy-related concept is called the Lagrangian, after Joseph-Louis
Lagrange. This formalism is as fundamental as the Hamiltonian, and both can
be used to derive the equations of motion or be derived from them. It was
invented in the context of classical mechanics, but is generally useful in
modern physics. The Lagrangian is defined as the kinetic energy minus the
potential energy. Usually, the Lagrange formalism is mathematically more
convenient than the Hamiltonian for non-conservative systems (such as
systems with friction).

Noether's theorem (1918) states that any differentiable symmetry of the
action of a physical system has a corresponding conservation law. Noether's
theorem has become a fundamental tool of modern theoretical physics and the
calculus of variations. A generalisation of the seminal formulations on
constants of motion in Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics (1788 and 1833,
respectively), it does not apply to systems that cannot be modeled with a
Lagrangian; for example, dissipative systems with continuous symmetries
need not have a corresponding conservation law.

Chemistry

In the context of chemistry, energy is an attribute of a substance as a
consequence of its atomic, molecular or aggregate structure. Since a
chemical transformation is accompanied by a change in one or more of these
kinds of structure, it is invariably accompanied by an increase or decrease
of energy of the substances involved. Some energy is transferred between
the surroundings and the reactants of the reaction in the form of heat or
light; thus the products of a reaction may have more or less energy than
the reactants. A reaction is said to be exergonic if the final state is
lower on the energy scale than the initial state; in the case of endergonic
reactions the situation is the reverse. Chemical reactions are invariably
not possible unless the reactants surmount an energy barrier known as the
activation energy. The speed of a chemical reaction (at given temperature
T) is related to the activation energy E, by the Boltzmann's population
factor e−E/kT – that is the probability of molecule to have energy greater
than or equal to E at the given temperature T. This exponential dependence
of a reaction rate on temperature is known as the Arrhenius equation.The
activation energy necessary for a chemical reaction can be in the form of
thermal energy.

Biology

Main articles: Bioenergetics and Food energy

In biology, energy is an attribute of all biological systems from the
biosphere to the smallest living organism. Within an organism it is
responsible for growth and development of a biological cell or an organelle
of a biological organism. Energy is thus often said to be stored by cells
in the structures of molecules of substances such as carbohydrates
(including sugars), lipids, and proteins, which release energy when reacted
with oxygen in respiration. In human terms, the human equivalent (H-e)
(Human energy conversion) indicates, for a given amount of energy
expenditure, the relative quantity of energy needed for human metabolism,
assuming an average human energy expenditure of 12,500kJ per day and a
basal metabolic rate of 80 watts. For example, if our bodies run (on
average) at 80 watts, then a light bulb running at 100 watts is running at
1.25 human equivalents (100 ÷ 80) i.e. 1.25 H-e. For a difficult task of
only a few seconds' duration, a person can put out thousands of watts, many
times the 746 watts in one official horsepower. For tasks lasting a few
minutes, a fit human can generate perhaps 1,000 watts. For an activity that
must be sustained for an hour, output drops to around 300; for an activity
kept up all day, 150 watts is about the maximum.⁷ The human equivalent
assists understanding of energy flows in physical and biological systems by
expressing energy units in human terms: it provides a "feel" for the use of
a given amount of energy⁸

Sunlight is also captured by plants as chemical potential energy in
photosynthesis, when carbon dioxide and water (two low-energy compounds)
are converted into the high-energy compounds carbohydrates, lipids, and
proteins. Plants also release oxygen during photosynthesis, which is
utilized by living organisms as an electron acceptor, to release the energy
of carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins. Release of the energy stored during
photosynthesis as heat or light may be triggered suddenly by a spark, in a
forest fire, or it may be made available more slowly for animal or human
metabolism, when these molecules are ingested, and catabolism is triggered
by enzyme action.

Any living organism relies on an external source of energy—radiation from
the Sun in the case of green plants; chemical energy in some form in the
case of animals—to be able to grow and reproduce. The daily 1500–2000
Calories (6–8 MJ) recommended for a human adult are taken as a combination
of oxygen and food molecules, the latter mostly carbohydrates and fats, of
which glucose (C₆H₁₂O₆) and stearin (C₅₇H₁₁₀O₆) are convenient examples.
The food molecules are oxidised to carbon dioxide and water in the
mitochondria

    C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂ → 6CO₂ + 6H₂OC₅₇H₁₁₀O₆ + 81.5O₂ → 57CO₂ + 55H₂O

and some of the energy is used to convert ADP into ATP

    ADP + HPO₄2− → ATP + H₂O

The rest of the chemical energy in the carbohydrate or fat is converted
into heat: the ATP is used as a sort of "energy currency", and some of the
chemical energy it contains when split and reacted with water, is used for
other metabolism (at each stage of a metabolic pathway, some chemical
energy is converted into heat). Only a tiny fraction of the original
chemical energy is used for work:[note 2]

  gain in kinetic energy of a sprinter during a 100 m race: 4 kJgain in
  gravitational potential energy of a 150 kg weight lifted through 2
  metres: 3kJDaily food intake of a normal adult: 6–8 MJ

It would appear that living organisms are remarkably inefficient (in the
physical sense) in their use of the energy they receive (chemical energy or
radiation), and it is true that most real machines manage higher
efficiencies. In growing organisms the energy that is converted to heat
serves a vital purpose, as it allows the organism tissue to be highly
ordered with regard to the molecules it is built from. The second law of
thermodynamics states that energy (and matter) tends to become more evenly
spread out across the universe: to concentrate energy (or matter) in one
specific place, it is necessary to spread out a greater amount of energy
(as heat) across the remainder of the universe ("the surroundings").[note
3] Simpler organisms can achieve higher energy efficiencies than more
complex ones, but the complex organisms can occupy ecological niches that
are not available to their simpler brethren. The conversion of a portion of
the chemical energy to heat at each step in a metabolic pathway is the
physical reason behind the pyramid of biomass observed in ecology: to take
just the first step in the food chain, of the estimated 124.7 Pg/a of
carbon that is fixed by photosynthesis, 64.3 Pg/a (52%) are used for the
metabolism of green plants,⁹ i.e. reconverted into carbon dioxide and heat.

Earth sciences

In geology, continental drift, mountain ranges, volcanoes, and earthquakes
are phenomena that can be explained in terms of energy transformations in
the Earth's interior.,¹⁰ while meteorological phenomena like wind, rain,
hail, snow, lightning, tornadoes and hurricanes, are all a result of energy
transformations brought about by solar energy on the atmosphere of the
planet Earth.

Sunlight may be stored as gravitational potential energy after it strikes
the Earth, as (for example) water evaporates from oceans and is deposited
upon mountains (where, after being released at a hydroelectric dam, it can
be used to drive turbines or generators to produce electricity). Sunlight
also drives many weather phenomena, save those generated by volcanic
events. An example of a solar-mediated weather event is a hurricane, which
occurs when large unstable areas of warm ocean, heated over months, give up
some of their thermal energy suddenly to power a few days of violent air
movement.

In a slower process, radioactive decay of atoms in the core of the Earth
releases heat. This thermal energy drives plate tectonics and may lift
mountains, via orogenesis. This slow lifting represents a kind of
gravitational potential energy storage of the thermal energy, which may be
later released to active kinetic energy in landslides, after a triggering
event. Earthquakes also release stored elastic potential energy in rocks, a
store that has been produced ultimately from the same radioactive heat
sources. Thus, according to present understanding, familiar events such as
landslides and earthquakes release energy that has been stored as potential
energy in the Earth's gravitational field or elastic strain (mechanical
potential energy) in rocks. Prior to this, they represent release of energy
that has been stored in heavy atoms since the collapse of long-destroyed
supernova stars created these atoms.

Cosmology

In cosmology and astronomy the phenomena of stars, nova, supernova, quasars
and gamma ray bursts are the universe's highest-output energy
transformations of matter. All stellar phenomena (including solar activity)
are driven by various kinds of energy transformations. Energy in such
transformations is either from gravitational collapse of matter (usually
molecular hydrogen) into various classes of astronomical objects (stars,
black holes, etc.), or from nuclear fusion (of lighter elements, primarily
hydrogen). The nuclear fusion of hydrogen in the Sun also releases another
store of potential energy which was created at the time of the Big Bang. At
that time, according to theory, space expanded and the universe cooled too
rapidly for hydrogen to completely fuse into heavier elements. This meant
that hydrogen represents a store of potential energy that can be released
by fusion. Such a fusion process is triggered by heat and pressure
generated from gravitational collapse of hydrogen clouds when they produce
stars, and some of the fusion energy is then transformed into sunlight.

Quantum mechanics

Main article: Energy operator

In quantum mechanics, energy is defined in terms of the energy operatoras a
time derivative of the wave function. The Schrödinger equation equates the
energy operator to the full energy of a particle or a system. Its results
can be considered as a definition of measurement of energy in quantum
mechanics. The Schrödinger equation describes the space- and
time-dependence of a slowly changing (non-relativistic) wave function of
quantum systems. The solution of this equation for a bound system is
discrete (a set of permitted states, each characterized by an energy level)
which results in the concept of quanta. In the solution of the Schrödinger
equation for any oscillator (vibrator) and for electromagnetic waves in a
vacuum, the resulting energy states are related to the frequency by
Planck's relation: E = hν (where h is Planck's constant and ν the
frequency). In the case of an electromagnetic wave these energy states are
called quanta of light or photons.

Relativity

When calculating kinetic energy (work to accelerate a mass from zero speed
to some finite speed) relativistically – using Lorentz transformations
instead of Newtonian mechanics – Einstein discovered an unexpected
by-product of these calculations to be an energy term which does not vanish
at zero speed. He called it rest mass energy: energy which every mass must
possess even when being at rest. The amount of energy is directly
proportional to the mass of body:

E = m c²

where

  m is the mass,c is the speed of light in vacuum,E is the rest mass
  energy.

For example, consider electron–positron annihilation, in which the rest
mass of individual particles is destroyed, but the inertia equivalent of
the system of the two particles (its invariant mass) remains (since all
energy is associated with mass), and this inertia and invariant mass is
carried off by photons which individually are massless, but as a system
retain their mass. This is a reversible process – the inverse process is
called pair creation – in which the rest mass of particles is created from
energy of two (or more) annihilating photons. In this system the matter
(electrons and positrons) is destroyed and changed to non-matter energy
(the photons). However, the total system mass and energy do not change
during this interaction.

In general relativity, the stress–energy tensor serves as the source term
for the gravitational field, in rough analogy to the way mass serves as the
source term in the non-relativistic Newtonian approximation.¹¹

It is not uncommon to hear that energy is "equivalent" to mass. It would be
more accurate to state that every energy has an inertia and gravity
equivalent, and because mass is a form of energy, then mass too has inertia
and gravity associated with it.

In classical physics, energy is a scalar quantity, the canonical conjugate
to time. In special relativity energy is also a scalar (although not a
Lorentz scalar but a time component of the energy–momentum 4-vector).¹¹ In
other words, energy is invariant with respect to rotations of space, but
not invariant with respect to rotations of space-time (= boosts).

Transformation

Main article: Energy transformation

Energy may be transformed between different forms at various efficiencies.
Items that transform between these forms are called transducers. Examples
of transducers include a battery, from chemical energy to electric energy;
a dam: gravitational potential energy to kinetic energy of moving water
(and the blades of a turbine) and ultimately to electric energy through an
electric generator.

There are strict limits to how efficiently energy can be converted into
other forms of energy via work, and heat as described by Carnot's theorem
and the second law of thermodynamics. These limits are especially evident
when an engine is used to perform work. However, some energy
transformations can be quite efficient. The direction of transformations in
energy (what kind of energy is transformed to what other kind) is often
determined by entropy (equal energy spread among all available degrees of
freedom) considerations. In practice all energy transformations are
permitted on a small scale, but certain larger transformations are not
permitted because it is statistically unlikely that energy or matter will
randomly move into more concentrated forms or smaller spaces.

Energy transformations in the universe over time are characterized by
various kinds of potential energy that has been available since the Big
Bang, later being "released" (transformed to more active types of energy
such as kinetic or radiant energy), when a triggering mechanism is
available. Familiar examples of such processes include nuclear decay, in
which energy is released that was originally "stored" in heavy isotopes
(such as uranium and thorium), by nucleosynthesis, a process ultimately
using the gravitational potential energy released from the gravitational
collapse of supernovae, to store energy in the creation of these heavy
elements before they were incorporated into the solar system and the Earth.
This energy is triggered and released in nuclear fission bombs or in civil
nuclear power generation. Similarly, in the case of a chemical explosion,
chemical potential energy is transformed to kinetic energy and thermal
energy in a very short time. Yet another example is that of a pendulum. At
its highest points the kinetic energy is zero and the gravitational
potential energy is at maximum. At its lowest point the kinetic energy is
at maximum and is equal to the decrease of potential energy. If one
(unrealistically) assumes that there is no friction or other losses, the
conversion of energy between these processes would be perfect, and the
pendulum would continue swinging forever.

Energy is also transferred from potential energy (Eₚ) to kinetic energy
(Eₖ) and then back to potential energy constantly. This is referred to as
conservation of energy. In this closed system, energy cannot be created or
destroyed; therefore, the initial energy and the final energy will be equal
to each other. This can be demonstrated by the following:

The equation can then be simplified further since Eₚ ₌ ₘgh (mass times
acceleration due to gravity times the height) and E_k = \frac{1}{2} mv²
(half mass times velocity squared). Then the total amount of energy can be
found by adding Eₚ ₊ Eₖ ₌ E_{total}.

Conservation of energy and mass in transformation

Energy gives rise to weight when it is trapped in a system with zero
momentum, where it can be weighed. It is also equivalent to mass, and this
mass is always associated with it. Mass is also equivalent to a certain
amount of energy, and likewise always appears associated with it, as
described in mass-energy equivalence. The formula E = mc², derived by
Albert Einstein (1905) quantifies the relationship between rest-mass and
rest-energy within the concept of special relativity. In different
theoretical frameworks, similar formulas were derived by J. J. Thomson
(1881), Henri Poincaré (1900), Friedrich Hasenöhrl (1904) and others (see
Mass-energy equivalence#History for further information).

Matter may be converted to energy (and vice versa), but mass cannot ever be
destroyed; rather, mass/energy equivalence remains a constant for both the
matter and the energy, during any process when they are converted into each
other. However, since c² is extremely large relative to ordinary human
scales, the conversion of ordinary amount of matter (for example, 1 kg) to
other forms of energy (such as heat, light, and other radiation) can
liberate tremendous amounts of energy (~9\times 10^{16} joules = 21
megatons of TNT), as can be seen in nuclear reactors and nuclear weapons.
Conversely, the mass equivalent of a unit of energy is minuscule, which is
why a loss of energy (loss of mass) from most systems is difficult to
measure by weight, unless the energy loss is very large. Examples of energy
transformation into matter (i.e., kinetic energy into particles with rest
mass) are found in high-energy nuclear physics.

Reversible and non-reversible transformations

Thermodynamics divides energy transformation into two kinds: reversible
processes and irreversible processes. An irreversible process is one in
which energy is dissipated (spread) into empty energy states available in a
volume, from which it cannot be recovered into more concentrated forms
(fewer quantum states), without degradation of even more energy. A
reversible process is one in which this sort of dissipation does not
happen. For example, conversion of energy from one type of potential field
to another, is reversible, as in the pendulum system described above. In
processes where heat is generated, quantum states of lower energy, present
as possible excitations in fields between atoms, act as a reservoir for
part of the energy, from which it cannot be recovered, in order to be
converted with 100% efficiency into other forms of energy. In this case,
the energy must partly stay as heat, and cannot be completely recovered as
usable energy, except at the price of an increase in some other kind of
heat-like increase in disorder in quantum states, in the universe (such as
an expansion of matter, or a randomisation in a crystal).

As the universe evolves in time, more and more of its energy becomes
trapped in irreversible states (i.e., as heat or other kinds of increases
in disorder). This has been referred to as the inevitable thermodynamic
heat death of the universe. In this heat death the energy of the universe
does not change, but the fraction of energy which is available to do work
through a heat engine, or be transformed to other usable forms of energy
(through the use of generators attached to heat engines), grows less and
less.

Conservation of energy

Main article: Conservation of energy

According to conservation of energy, energy can neither be created
(produced) nor destroyed by itself. It can only be transformed. The total
inflow of energy into a system must equal the total outflow of energy from
the system, plus the change in the energy contained within the system.
Energy is subject to a strict global conservation law; that is, whenever
one measures (or calculates) the total energy of a system of particles
whose interactions do not depend explicitly on time, it is found that the
total energy of the system always remains constant.¹²

Richard Feynman said during a 1961 lecture:¹³

  There is a fact, or if you wish, a law, governing all natural phenomena
  that are known to date. There is no known exception to this law—it is
  exact so far as we know. The law is called the conservation of energy. It
  states that there is a certain quantity, which we call energy, that does
  not change in manifold changes which nature undergoes. That is a most
  abstract idea, because it is a mathematical principle; it says that there
  is a numerical quantity which does not change when something happens. It
  is not a description of a mechanism, or anything concrete; it is just a
  strange fact that we can calculate some number and when we finish
  watching nature go through her tricks and calculate the number again, it
  is the same.
  — The Feynman Lectures on Physics

Most kinds of energy (with gravitational energy being a notable
exception)¹⁴ are subject to strict local conservation laws as well. In this
case, energy can only be exchanged between adjacent regions of space, and
all observers agree as to the volumetric density of energy in any given
space. There is also a global law of conservation of energy, stating that
the total energy of the universe cannot change; this is a corollary of the
local law, but not vice versa.² ¹³

This law is a fundamental principle of physics. As shown rigorously by
Noether's theorem, the conservation of energy is a mathematical consequence
of translational symmetry of time,¹⁵ a property of most phenomena below the
cosmic scale that makes them independent of their locations on the time
coordinate. Put differently, yesterday, today, and tomorrow are physically
indistinguishable. This is because energy is the quantity which is
canonical conjugate to time. This mathematical entanglement of energy and
time also results in the uncertainty principle - it is impossible to define
the exact amount of energy during any definite time interval. The
uncertainty principle should not be confused with energy conservation -
rather it provides mathematical limits to which energy can in principle be
defined and measured.

Each of the basic forces of nature is associated with a different type of
potential energy, and all types of potential energy (like all other types
of energy) appears as system mass, whenever present. For example, a
compressed spring will be slightly more massive than before it was
compressed. Likewise, whenever energy is transferred between systems by any
mechanism, an associated mass is transferred with it.

In quantum mechanics energy is expressed using the Hamiltonian operator. On
any time scales, the uncertainty in the energy is by

ΔE Δt \ge \frac { \hbar } {2 }

which is similar in form to the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle (but not
really mathematically equivalent thereto, since H and t are not dynamically
conjugate variables, neither in classical nor in quantum mechanics).

In particle physics, this inequality permits a qualitative understanding of
virtual particles which carry momentum, exchange by which and with real
particles, is responsible for the creation of all known fundamental forces
(more accurately known as fundamental interactions). Virtual photons (which
are simply lowest quantum mechanical energy state of photons) are also
responsible for electrostatic interaction between electric charges (which
results in Coulomb law), for spontaneous radiative decay of exited atomic
and nuclear states, for the Casimir force, for van der Waals bond forces
and some other observable phenomena.

Transfer between systems

Main article: Energy transfer

Closed systems

Energy transfer usually refers to movements of energy between systems which
are closed to transfers of matter. The portion of the energy which is
transferred by conservative forces over a distance is measured as the work
the source system does on the receiving system. The portion of the energy
which does not do work doing during the transfer is called heat.[note 4]
Energy can be transferred between systems in a variety of ways. Examples
include the transmission of electromagnetic energy via photons, physical
collisions which transfer kinetic energy,[note 5] and the conductive
transfer of thermal energy.

Energy is strictly conserved and is also locally conserved wherever it can
be defined. Mathematically, the process of energy transfer is described by
the first law of thermodynamics:[note 6]

where E is the amount of energy transferred, W  represents the work done on
the system, and Q represents the heat flow into the system. As a
simplification, the heat term, Q, is sometimes ignored, especially when the
thermal efficiency of the transfer is high.

This simplified equation is the one used to define the joule, for example.

Open systems

There are other ways in which an open system can gain or lose energy. In
chemical systems, energy can be added to a system by means of adding
substances with different chemical potentials, which potentials are then
extracted (both of these process are illustrated by fueling an auto, a
system which gains in energy thereby, without addition of either work or
heat). These terms may be added to the above equation, or they can
generally be subsumed into a quantity called "energy addition term E" which
refers to any type of energy carried over the surface of a control volume
or system volume. Examples may be seen above, and many others can be
imagined (for example, the kinetic energy of a stream of particles entering
a system, or energy from a laser beam adds to system energy, without either
being either work-done or heat-added, in the classic senses).

Where E in this general equation represents other additional advected
energy terms not covered by work done on a system, or heat added to it.

Thermodynamics

Internal energy

Internal energy is the sum of all microscopic forms of energy of a system.
It is the energy needed to create the system. It is related to the
potential energy, e.g., molecular structure, crystal structure, and other
geometric aspects, as well as the motion of the particles, in form of
kinetic energy. Thermodynamics is chiefly concerned with changes in
internal energy and not its absolute value, which is impossible to
determine with thermodynamics alone.¹⁶

First law of thermodynamics

The first law of thermodynamics asserts that energy (but not necessarily
thermodynamic free energy) is always conserved¹⁷ and that heat flow is a
form of energy transfer. For homogeneous systems, with a well-defined
temperature and pressure, a commonly used corollary of the first law is
that, for a system subject only to pressure forces and heat transfer (e.g.,
a cylinder-full of gas), the differential change in the internal energy of
the system (with a gain in energy signified by a positive quantity) is
given as

\mathrm{d} E = T\mathrm{d} S - P\mathrm{d} V

where the first term on the right is the heat transferred into the system,
expressed in terms of temperature T and entropy S (in which entropy
increases and the change dS is positive when the system is heated), and the
last term on the right hand side is identified as work done on the system,
where pressure is P and volume V (the negative sign results since
compression of the system requires work to be done on it and so the volume
change, dV, is negative when work is done on the system).

This equation is highly specific, ignoring all chemical, electrical,
nuclear, and gravitational forces, effects such as advection of any form of
energy other than heat and pV-work. The general formulation of the first
law (i.e., conservation of energy) is valid even in situations in which the
system is not homogeneous. For these cases the change in internal energy of
a closed system is expressed in a general form by

\mathrm{d} E=δQ+δW

where δQ is the heat supplied to the system and δW is the work applied to
the system.

Equipartition of energy

The energy of a mechanical harmonic oscillator (a mass on a spring) is
alternatively kinetic and potential. At two points in the oscillation cycle
it is entirely kinetic, and alternatively at two other points it is
entirely potential. Over the whole cycle, or over many cycles, net energy
is thus equally split between kinetic and potential. This is called
equipartition principle; total energy of a system with many degrees of
freedom is equally split among all available degrees of freedom.

This principle is vitally important to understanding the behaviour of a
quantity closely related to energy, called entropy. Entropy is a measure of
evenness of a distribution of energy between parts of a system. When an
isolated system is given more degrees of freedom (i.e., given new available
energy states that are the same as existing states), then total energy
spreads over all available degrees equally without distinction between
"new" and "old" degrees. This mathematical result is called the second law
of thermodynamics.

Notes

[1] Energy (and its units) are often defined in terms of the work they can
  do. However, technically this is only an approximation, because the
  second law of thermodynamics means the work a system can do is always
  less than the total energy of the system, due to waste heat. See: Robert
  L. Lehrman (1973). "Energy is not the ability to do work" (PDF). The
  Physics Teacher.
[2] These examples are solely for illustration, as it is not the energy
  available for work which limits the performance of the athlete but the
  power output of the sprinter and the force of the weightlifter. A worker
  stacking shelves in a supermarket does more work (in the physical sense)
  than either of the athletes, but does it more slowly.
[3] Crystals are another example of highly ordered systems that exist in
  nature: in this case too, the order is associated with the transfer of a
  large amount of heat (known as the lattice energy) to the surroundings.
[4] Although heat is "wasted" energy for a specific energy transfer,(see:
  waste heat) it can often be harnessed to do useful work in subsequent
  interactions. However, the maximum energy that can be "recycled" from
  such recovery processes is limited by the second law of thermodynamics.
[5] The mechanism for most macroscopic physical collisions is actually
  electromagnetic, but it is very common to simplify the interaction by
  ignoring the mechanism of collision and just calculate the beginning and
  end result.
[6] There are several sign conventions for this equation. Here, the signs
  in this equation follow the IUPAC convention.

Galaxy

This article is about the astronomical structure. For other uses, see
Galaxy (disambiguation).
NGC 4414, a typical spiral galaxy in the constellation Coma Berenices, is
about 55,000 light-years in diameter and approximately 60 million
light-years away from Earth

A galaxy is a gravitationally bound system of stars, stellar remnants,
interstellar gas and dust, and dark matter.¹ ² The word galaxy is derived
from the Greek galaxias (γαλαξίας), literally "milky", a reference to the
Milky Way. Galaxies range in size from dwarfs with just a few thousand
(10³) stars to giants with one hundred trillion (10¹⁴) stars,³ each
orbiting their galaxy's own center of mass. Galaxies are categorized
according to their visual morphology, including elliptical,⁴ spiral, and
irregular.⁵ Many galaxies are thought to have black holes at their active
centers. The Milky Way's central black hole, known as Sagittarius A*, has a
mass four million times greater than our own Sun.⁶ As of July 2015, EGSY8p7
is the oldest and most distant galaxy with a light travel distance of 13.2
billion light-years from Earth, and observed as it existed 570 million
years after the Big Bang. Previously, as of May 2015, EGS-zs8-1 was the
most distant known galaxy, estimated to have a light travel distance of
13.1 billion light-years away and to have 15% of the mass of the Milky
Way.⁷ ⁸ ⁹ ¹⁰

Approximately 170 billion (1.7 × 10¹¹) to 200 billion (2.0 × 10¹¹) galaxies
exist in the observable universe.¹¹ Most of the galaxies are 1,000 to
100,000 parsecs in diameter and usually separated by distances on the order
of millions of parsecs (or megaparsecs). The space between galaxies is
filled with a tenuous gas with an average density less than one atom per
cubic meter. The majority of galaxies are gravitationally organized into
associations known as galaxy groups, clusters, and superclusters. At the
largest scale, these associations are generally arranged into sheets and
filaments that are surrounded by immense voids.¹²

Etymology

The word galaxy derives from the Greek term for our own galaxy, galaxias
(γαλαξίας, "milky one"), or kyklos galaktikos ("milky circle")¹³ due to its
appearance as a "milky" band of light in the sky. In Greek mythology, Zeus
places his son born by a mortal woman, the infant Heracles, on Hera's
breast while she is asleep so that the baby will drink her divine milk and
will thus become immortal. Hera wakes up while breastfeeding and then
realizes she is nursing an unknown baby: she pushes the baby away and a jet
of her milk sprays the night sky, producing the faint band of light known
as the Milky Way.¹⁴ ¹⁵

In the astronomical literature, the capitalized word "Galaxy" is often used
to refer to our galaxy, the Milky Way, to distinguish it from the other
galaxies in our universe. The English term Milky Way can be traced back to
a story by Chaucer c. 1380:

  "See yonder, lo, the Galaxyë
  Which men clepeth the Milky Wey,
  For hit is whyt."
  — Geoffrey Chaucer, The House of Fame¹³

When William Herschel assembled his catalog of deep sky objects in 1786, he
used the term spiral nebula for certain objects such as M31. These would
later be recognized as conglomerations of stars when the true distance to
these objects began to be appreciated, and they would later be termed
island universes. However, the word Universe was understood to mean the
entirety of existence, so this expression fell into disuse and the objects
instead became known as galaxies.¹⁶

Nomenclature

Tens of thousands of galaxies have been catalogued, but only a few have
well-established names, such as the Andromeda Galaxy, the Magellanic
clouds, the Whirlpool Galaxy and the Sombrero Galaxy. Astronomers work with
numbers from certain catalogues, such as the Messier catalogue, the NGC
(New General Catalogue), the IC (Index Catalogue), the CGCG (Catalogue of
Galaxies and of Clusters of Galaxies), the MCG (Morphological Catalogue of
Galaxies) and UGC (Uppsala General Catalogue of Galaxies). All of the
well-known galaxies appear in one or more of these catalogues but each time
under a different number. For example, Messier 109 is a spiral galaxy
having the number 109 in the catalogue of Messier, but also codes NGC3992,
UGC6937, CGCG 269-023, MCG +09-20-044, and PGC 37617.

Because it is customary in science to assign names to most of the studied
objects, even to the smallest ones, the Belgian astrophysicist Gerard
Bodifee and the classicist Michel Berger started a new catalogue
(CNG-Catalogue of Named Galaxies)¹⁷ in which a thousand well-known galaxies
are given meaningful, descriptive names in Latin (or Latinized Greek)¹⁸ in
accordance with the binomial nomenclature that one uses in other sciences
such as biology, anatomy, paleontology and in other fields of astronomy
such as the geography of Mars. One of the arguments to do so is that these
impressive objects deserve better than uninspired codes. For instance,
Bodifee and Berger propose the informal, descriptive name Callimorphus
Ursae Majoris for the well-formed barred galaxy Messier 109 in Ursa Major.

Observation history

The realization that we live in a galaxy, and that ours is one among many,
parallels major discoveries that were made about the Milky Way and other
nebulae in the night sky.

Milky Way

Main article: Milky Way

The Greek philosopher Democritus (450–370 BC) proposed that the bright band
on the night sky known as the Milky Way might consist of distant stars.¹⁹
Aristotle (384–322 BC), however, believed the Milky Way to be caused by
"the ignition of the fiery exhalation of some stars that were large,
numerous and close together" and that the "ignition takes place in the
upper part of the atmosphere, in the region of the World that is continuous
with the heavenly motions."²⁰ The Neoplatonist philosopher Olympiodorus the
Younger (c. 495–570 AD) was critical of this view, arguing that if the
Milky Way is sublunary (situated between Earth and the Moon) it should
appear different at different times and places on Earth, and that it should
have parallax, which it does not. In his view, the Milky Way is
celestial.²¹

According to Mohani Mohamed, the Arabian astronomer Alhazen (965–1037) made
the first attempt at observing and measuring the Milky Way's parallax,²²
and he thus "determined that because the Milky Way had no parallax, it must
be remote from the Earth, not belonging to the atmosphere."²³ The Persian
astronomer al-Bīrūnī (973–1048) proposed the Milky Way galaxy to be "a
collection of countless fragments of the nature of nebulous stars."²⁴ ²⁵
The Andalusian astronomer Ibn Bajjah ("Avempace", d. 1138) proposed that
the Milky Way is made up of many stars that almost touch one another and
appear to be a continuous image due to the effect of refraction from
sublunary material,²⁰ ²⁶ citing his observation of the conjunction of
Jupiter and Mars as evidence of this occurring when two objects are near.²⁰
In the 14th century, the Syrian-born Ibn Qayyim proposed the Milky Way
galaxy to be "a myriad of tiny stars packed together in the sphere of the
fixed stars."²⁷

Actual proof of the Milky Way consisting of many stars came in 1610 when
the Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei used a telescope to study the Milky
Way and discovered that it is composed of a huge number of faint stars.²⁸
²⁹ In 1750 the English astronomer Thomas Wright, in his An original theory
or new hypothesis of the Universe, speculated (correctly) that the galaxy
might be a rotating body of a huge number of stars held together by
gravitational forces, akin to the solar system but on a much larger scale.
The resulting disk of stars can be seen as a band on the sky from our
perspective inside the disk.³⁰ ³¹ In a treatise in 1755, Immanuel Kant
elaborated on Wright's idea about the structure of the Milky Way.³²

The first project to describe the shape of the Milky Way and the position
of the Sun was undertaken by William Herschel in 1785 by counting the
number of stars in different regions of the sky. He produced a diagram of
the shape of the galaxy with the solar system close to the center.³³ ³⁴
Using a refined approach, Kapteyn in 1920 arrived at the picture of a small
(diameter about 15 kiloparsecs) ellipsoid galaxy with the Sun close to the
center. A different method by Harlow Shapley based on the cataloguing of
globular clusters led to a radically different picture: a flat disk with
diameter approximately 70 kiloparsecs and the Sun far from the center.³¹
Both analyses failed to take into account the absorption of light by
interstellar dust present in the galactic plane, but after Robert Julius
Trumpler quantified this effect in 1930 by studying open clusters, the
present picture of our host galaxy, the Milky Way, emerged.³⁵

Distinction from other nebulae

A few galaxies outside the Milky Way are visible in the night sky to the
unaided eye. In the 10th century, the Persian astronomer Al-Sufi made the
earliest recorded identification of the Andromeda Galaxy, describing it as
a "small cloud".³⁶ In 964, Al-Sufi identified the Large Magellanic Cloud in
his Book of Fixed Stars; it was not seen by Europeans until Magellan's
voyage in the 16th century.³⁷ ³⁸ The Andromeda Galaxy was independently
noted by Simon Marius in 1612.³⁶

In 1750, Thomas Wright speculated (correctly) that the Milky Way is a
flattened disk of stars, and that some of the nebulae visible in the night
sky might be separate Milky Ways.³¹ ³⁹ In 1755, Immanuel Kant used the term
"island Universe" to describe these distant nebulae.

Toward the end of the 18th century, Charles Messier compiled a catalog
containing the 109 brightest celestial objects having nebulous appearance.
Subsequently, William Herschel assembled a catalog of 5,000 nebulae.³¹ In
1845, Lord Rosse constructed a new telescope and was able to distinguish
between elliptical and spiral nebulae. He also managed to make out
individual point sources in some of these nebulae, lending credence to
Kant's earlier conjecture.⁴⁰

In 1912, Vesto Slipher made spectrographic studies of the brightest spiral
nebulae to determine their composition. Slipher discovered that the spiral
nebulae have high Doppler shifts, indicating that they are moving at a rate
exceeding the velocity of the stars he had measured. He found that the
majority of these nebulae are moving away from us.⁴¹ ⁴²

In 1917, Heber Curtis observed nova S Andromedae within the "Great
Andromeda Nebula" (as the Andromeda Galaxy, Messier object M31, was then
known). Searching the photographic record, he found 11 more novae. Curtis
noticed that these novae were, on average, 10 magnitudes fainter than those
that occurred within our galaxy. As a result, he was able to come up with a
distance estimate of 150,000 parsecs. He became a proponent of the
so-called "island universes" hypothesis, which holds that spiral nebulae
are actually independent galaxies.⁴³

In 1920 the so-called Great Debate took place between Harlow Shapley and
Heber Curtis, concerning the nature of the Milky Way, spiral nebulae, and
the dimensions of the Universe. To support his claim that the Great
Andromeda Nebula is an external galaxy, Curtis noted the appearance of dark
lanes resembling the dust clouds in the Milky Way, as well as the
significant Doppler shift.⁴⁴

In 1922, the Estonian astronomer Ernst Öpik gave a distance determination
that supported the theory that the Andromeda Nebula is indeed a distant
extra-galactic object.⁴⁵ Using the new 100 inch Mt. Wilson telescope, Edwin
Hubble was able to resolve the outer parts of some spiral nebulae as
collections of individual stars and identified some Cepheid variables, thus
allowing him to estimate the distance to the nebulae: they were far too
distant to be part of the Milky Way.⁴⁶ In 1936 Hubble produced a
classification of galactic morphology that is used to this day.⁴⁷

Modern research

In 1944, Hendrik van de Hulst predicted that microwave radiation with
wavelength of 21 cm would be detectable from interstellar atomic hydrogen
gas;⁴⁸ and in 1951 it was observed. This radiation is not affected by dust
absorption, and so its Doppler shift can be used to map the motion of the
gas in our galaxy. These observations led to the hypothesis of a rotating
bar structure in the center of our galaxy.⁴⁹ With improved radio
telescopes, hydrogen gas could also be traced in other galaxies. In the
1970s, Vera Rubin uncovered a discrepancy between observed galactic
rotation speed and that predicted by the visible mass of stars and gas.
Today, the galaxy rotation problem is thought to be explained by the
presence of large quantities of unseen dark matter.⁵⁰ ⁵¹ A concept known as
the universal rotation curve of spirals, moreover, shows that the problem
is ubiquitous in these objects.

Beginning in the 1990s, the Hubble Space Telescope yielded improved
observations. Among other things, Hubble data helped establish that the
missing dark matter in our galaxy cannot solely consist of inherently faint
and small stars.⁵² The Hubble Deep Field, an extremely long exposure of a
relatively empty part of the sky, provided evidence that there are about
125 billion (1.25×10¹¹) galaxies in the Universe.⁵³ Improved technology in
detecting the spectra invisible to humans (radio telescopes, infrared
cameras, and x-ray telescopes) allow detection of other galaxies that are
not detected by Hubble. Particularly, galaxy surveys in the Zone of
Avoidance (the region of the sky blocked by the Milky Way) have revealed a
number of new galaxies.⁵⁴

Types and morphology

Main article: Galaxy morphological classification

Galaxies come in three main types: ellipticals, spirals, and irregulars. A
slightly more extensive description of galaxy types based on their
appearance is given by the Hubble sequence. Since the Hubble sequence is
entirely based upon visual morphological type, it may miss certain
important characteristics of galaxies such as star formation rate in
starburst galaxies and activity in the cores of active galaxies.⁵

Ellipticals

Main article: Elliptical galaxy

The Hubble classification system rates elliptical galaxies on the basis of
their ellipticity, ranging from E0, being nearly spherical, up to E7, which
is highly elongated. These galaxies have an ellipsoidal profile, giving
them an elliptical appearance regardless of the viewing angle. Their
appearance shows little structure and they typically have relatively little
interstellar matter. Consequently, these galaxies also have a low portion
of open clusters and a reduced rate of new star formation. Instead they are
dominated by generally older, more evolved stars that are orbiting the
common center of gravity in random directions. The stars contain low
abundances of heavy elements because star formation ceases after the
initial burst. In this sense they have some similarity to the much smaller
globular clusters.⁵⁵

The largest galaxies are giant ellipticals. Many elliptical galaxies are
believed to form due to the interaction of galaxies, resulting in a
collision and merger. They can grow to enormous sizes (compared to spiral
galaxies, for example), and giant elliptical galaxies are often found near
the core of large galaxy clusters.⁵⁶ Starburst galaxies are the result of
such a galactic collision that can result in the formation of an elliptical
galaxy.⁵⁵

Shell galaxy

A shell galaxy is a type of elliptical galaxy where the stars in the
galaxy's halo are arranged in concentric shells. About 1/10 tenth of
elliptical galaxies have a shell-like structure, which has never been
observed in spiral galaxies. The shell-like structures are thought to
develop when a larger galaxy absorbs a smaller companion galaxy. As the two
galaxy centers approach, the centers start to oscillate around a center
point, the oscillation creates gravitational ripples forming the shells of
stars, similar to ripples spreading on water. For example, galaxy NGC 3923
has over twenty shells.⁵⁷

Spirals

Main articles: Spiral galaxy and Barred spiral galaxy

Spiral galaxies resemble spiraling pinwheels. Though the stars and other
visible material contained in such a galaxy lie mostly on a plane, the
majority of mass in spiral galaxies exists in a roughly spherical halo of
dark matter that extends beyond the visible component, as demonstrated by
the universal rotation curve concept.⁵⁸

Spiral galaxies consist of a rotating disk of stars and interstellar
medium, along with a central bulge of generally older stars. Extending
outward from the bulge are relatively bright arms. In the Hubble
classification scheme, spiral galaxies are listed as type S, followed by a
letter (a, b, or c) that indicates the degree of tightness of the spiral
arms and the size of the central bulge. An Sa galaxy has tightly wound,
poorly defined arms and possesses a relatively large core region. At the
other extreme, an Sc galaxy has open, well-defined arms and a small core
region.⁵⁹ A galaxy with poorly defined arms is sometimes referred to as a
flocculent spiral galaxy; in contrast to the grand design spiral galaxy
that has prominent and well-defined spiral arms.⁶⁰

It appears the reason that some spiral galaxies are fat and bulging while
some are flat discs is because of how fast they rotate.⁶¹

In spiral galaxies, the spiral arms do have the shape of approximate
logarithmic spirals, a pattern that can be theoretically shown to result
from a disturbance in a uniformly rotating mass of stars. Like the stars,
the spiral arms rotate around the center, but they do so with constant
angular velocity. The spiral arms are thought to be areas of high-density
matter, or "density waves".⁶² As stars move through an arm, the space
velocity of each stellar system is modified by the gravitational force of
the higher density. (The velocity returns to normal after the stars depart
on the other side of the arm.) This effect is akin to a "wave" of slowdowns
moving along a highway full of moving cars. The arms are visible because
the high density facilitates star formation, and therefore they harbor many
bright and young stars.⁶³

Hoag's Object, an example of a ring galaxy
NGC 5866, an example of a lenticular galaxy

Barred Spiral Galaxy

A majority of spiral galaxies, including our own Milky Way galaxy, have a
linear, bar-shaped band of stars that extends outward to either side of the
core, then merges into the spiral arm structure.⁶⁴ In the Hubble
classification scheme, these are designated by an SB, followed by a
lower-case letter (a, b or c) that indicates the form of the spiral arms
(in the same manner as the categorization of normal spiral galaxies). Bars
are thought to be temporary structures that can occur as a result of a
density wave radiating outward from the core, or else due to a tidal
interaction with another galaxy.⁶⁵ Many barred spiral galaxies are active,
possibly as a result of gas being channeled into the core along the arms.⁶⁶

Our own galaxy, the Milky Way, is a large disk-shaped barred-spiral
galaxy⁶⁷ about 30 kiloparsecs in diameter and a kiloparsec thick. It
contains about two hundred billion (2×10¹¹)⁶⁸ stars and has a total mass of
about six hundred billion (6×10¹¹) times the mass of the Sun.⁶⁹

Other morphologies

- Peculiar galaxies are galactic formations that develop unusual properties
  due to tidal interactions with other galaxies. An example of this is the
  ring galaxy, which possesses a ring-like structure of stars and
  interstellar medium surrounding a bare core. A ring galaxy is thought to
  occur when a smaller galaxy passes through the core of a spiral galaxy.⁷⁰
  Such an event may have affected the Andromeda Galaxy, as it displays a
  multi-ring-like structure when viewed in infrared radiation.⁷¹
- A lenticular galaxy is an intermediate form that has properties of both
  elliptical and spiral galaxies. These are categorized as Hubble type S0,
  and they possess ill-defined spiral arms with an elliptical halo of
  stars⁷² (barred lenticular galaxies receive Hubble classification SB0.)
- Irregular galaxies are galaxies that can not be readily classified into
  an elliptical or spiral morphology. An Irr-I galaxy has some structure
  but does not align cleanly with the Hubble classification scheme. Irr-II
  galaxies do not possess any structure that resembles a Hubble
  classification, and may have been disrupted.⁷³ Nearby examples of (dwarf)
  irregular galaxies include the Magellanic Clouds.
- An ultra diffuse galaxy (UDG) is an extremely-low-density galaxy. The
  galaxy may be the same size as the Milky Way but has a visible star count
  of only 1% of the Milky Way. The lack of luminosity is because there is a
  lack of star-forming gas in the galaxy which results in old stellar
  populations.

Dwarfs

Main article: Dwarf galaxy

Despite the prominence of large elliptical and spiral galaxies, most
galaxies in the Universe are dwarf galaxies. These galaxies are relatively
small when compared with other galactic formations, being about one
hundredth the size of the Milky Way, containing only a few billion stars.
Ultra-compact dwarf galaxies have recently been discovered that are only
100 parsecs across.⁷⁴

Many dwarf galaxies may orbit a single larger galaxy; the Milky Way has at
least a dozen such satellites, with an estimated 300–500 yet to be
discovered.⁷⁵ Dwarf galaxies may also be classified as elliptical, spiral,
or irregular. Since small dwarf ellipticals bear little resemblance to
large ellipticals, they are often called dwarf spheroidal galaxies instead.

A study of 27 Milky Way neighbors found that in all dwarf galaxies, the
central mass is approximately 10 million solar masses, regardless of
whether the galaxy has thousands or millions of stars. This has led to the
suggestion that galaxies are largely formed by dark matter, and that the
minimum size may indicate a form of warm dark matter incapable of
gravitational coalescence on a smaller scale.⁷⁶

Unusual dynamics and activities

Interacting

Main article: Interacting galaxy

Interactions between galaxies are relatively frequent, and they can play an
important role in galactic evolution. Near misses between galaxies result
in warping distortions due to tidal interactions, and may cause some
exchange of gas and dust.⁷⁷ ⁷⁸ Collisions occur when two galaxies pass
directly through each other and have sufficient relative momentum not to
merge. The stars of interacting galaxies will usually not collide, but the
gas and dust within the two forms will interact, sometimes triggering star
formation. A collision can severely distort the shape of the galaxies,
forming bars, rings or tail-like structures.⁷⁷ ⁷⁸

At the extreme of interactions are galactic mergers. In this case the
relative momentum of the two galaxies is insufficient to allow the galaxies
to pass through each other. Instead, they gradually merge to form a single,
larger galaxy. Mergers can result in significant changes to morphology, as
compared to the original galaxies. In the case where one of the galaxies is
much more massive, however, the result is known as cannibalism. In this
case the larger galaxy will remain relatively undisturbed by the merger,
while the smaller galaxy is torn apart. The Milky Way galaxy is currently
in the process of cannibalizing the Sagittarius Dwarf Elliptical Galaxy and
the Canis Major Dwarf Galaxy.⁷⁷ ⁷⁸

Starburst

Main article: Starburst galaxy

Stars are created within galaxies from a reserve of cold gas that forms
into giant molecular clouds. Some galaxies have been observed to form stars
at an exceptional rate, known as a starburst. Should they continue to do
so, however, they would consume their reserve of gas in a time frame lower
than the lifespan of the galaxy. Hence starburst activity usually lasts for
only about ten million years, a relatively brief period in the history of a
galaxy. Starburst galaxies were more common during the early history of the
Universe,⁸⁰ and, at present, still contribute an estimated 15% to the total
star production rate.⁸¹

Starburst galaxies are characterized by dusty concentrations of gas and the
appearance of newly formed stars, including massive stars that ionize the
surrounding clouds to create H II regions.⁸² These massive stars produce
supernova explosions, resulting in expanding remnants that interact
powerfully with the surrounding gas. These outbursts trigger a chain
reaction of star building that spreads throughout the gaseous region. Only
when the available gas is nearly consumed or dispersed does the starburst
activity come to an end.⁸⁰

Starbursts are often associated with merging or interacting galaxies. The
prototype example of such a starburst-forming interaction is M82, which
experienced a close encounter with the larger M81. Irregular galaxies often
exhibit spaced knots of starburst activity.⁸³

Active nucleus

Main article: Active galactic nucleus

A portion of the observable galaxies are classified as active. That is, a
significant portion of the total energy output from the galaxy is emitted
by a source other than the stars, dust and interstellar medium.

The standard model for an active galactic nucleus is based upon an
accretion disc that forms around a supermassive black hole (SMBH) at the
core region. The radiation from an active galactic nucleus results from the
gravitational energy of matter as it falls toward the black hole from the
disc.⁸⁴ In about 10% of these objects, a diametrically opposed pair of
energetic jets ejects particles from the core at velocities close to the
speed of light. The mechanism for producing these jets is still not well
understood.⁸⁵

Active galaxies that emit high-energy radiation in the form of x-rays are
classified as Seyfert galaxies or quasars, depending on the luminosity.

Blazars

Main article: Blazars

Blazars are believed to be an active galaxy with a relativistic jet that is
pointed in the direction of Earth. A radio galaxy emits radio frequencies
from relativistic jets. A unified model of these types of active galaxies
explains their differences based on the viewing angle of the observer.⁸⁵

LINERS

Main article: Low ionization nuclear emission line region

Possibly related to active galactic nuclei (as well as starburst regions)
are low-ionization nuclear emission-line regions (LINERs). The emission
from LINER-type galaxies is dominated by weakly ionized elements.⁸⁶
Approximately one-third of nearby galaxies are classified as containing
LINER nuclei.⁸⁴ ⁸⁶ ⁸⁷

Seyfert Galaxy

Main article: Seyfert Galaxy

Seyfert galaxies are one of the two largest groups of active galaxies,
along with quasars. They have quasar-like nuclei (very luminous, distant
and bright sources of electromagnetic radiation) with very high surface
brightnesses but unlike quasars, their host galaxies are clearly
detectable. Seyfert galaxies account for about 10% of all galaxies. Seen in
visible light, most Seyfert galaxies look like normal spiral galaxies, but
when studied under other wavelengths, the luminosity of their cores is
equivalent to the luminosity of whole galaxies the size of the Milky Way.

Quasar

Main article: Quasar

Quasars (/ˈkweɪzɑr/) or quasi-stellar radio sources are the most energetic
and distant members of a class of objects called active galactic nuclei
(AGN). Quasars are extremely luminous and were first identified as being
high redshift sources of electromagnetic energy, including radio waves and
visible light, that appeared to be similar to stars, rather than extended
sources similar to galaxies. Their luminosity can be 100 times greater than
that of the Milky Way.

Luminous infrared galaxy

Main article: Luminous infrared galaxy

Luminous Infrared Galaxies or (LIRG's) are galaxies with luminosities, the
measurement of brightness, above 1011 L☉. LIRG's are more abundant than
starburst galaxies, Seyfert galaxies and quasi-stellar objects at
comparable luminosity. Infrared galaxies emit more energy in the infrared
than at all other wavelengths combined. An LIRG's luminosity is 100 billion
times that of our sun.

Formation and evolution

Main article: Galaxy formation and evolution

Galactic formation and evolution is an active area of research in
astrophysics.

Formation

Current cosmological models of the early Universe are based on the Big Bang
theory. About 300,000 years after this event, atoms of hydrogen and helium
began to form, in an event called recombination. Nearly all the hydrogen
was neutral (non-ionized) and readily absorbed light, and no stars had yet
formed. As a result, this period has been called the "dark ages". It was
from density fluctuations (or anisotropic irregularities) in this
primordial matter that larger structures began to appear. As a result,
masses of baryonic matter started to condense within cold dark matter
halos.⁸⁹ ⁹⁰ These primordial structures would eventually become the
galaxies we see today.

Early galaxies

Evidence for the early appearance of galaxies was found in 2006, when it
was discovered that the galaxy IOK-1 has an unusually high redshift of
6.96, corresponding to just 750 million years after the Big Bang and making
it the most distant and primordial galaxy yet seen.⁹¹ While some scientists
have claimed other objects (such as Abell 1835 IR1916) have higher
redshifts (and therefore are seen in an earlier stage of the Universe's
evolution), IOK-1's age and composition have been more reliably
established. In December 2012, astronomers reported that the UDFj-39546284
is the most distant object known and has a redshift value of 11.9. The
object, is estimated to have existed around "380 million years"⁹² after the
Big Bang (which was about 13.8 billion years ago),⁹³ is about 13.42 billion
light years away. The existence of such early protogalaxies suggests that
they must have grown in the so-called "dark ages".⁸⁹ As of May 5, 2015, the
galaxy EGS-zs8-1 is the most distant and earliest galaxy measured, forming
670 million years after the Big Bang. The light from EGS-zs8-1 has taken 13
billion years to reach Earth, and is now 30 billion light-years away,
because of the expansion of the universe during 13 billion years.⁹⁴ ⁹⁵ ⁹⁶
⁹⁶ ⁹⁷ ⁹⁸

Early galaxy formation

The detailed process by which early galaxies formed is an open question in
astrophysics. Theories can be divided into two categories: top-down and
bottom-up. In top-down theories (such as the Eggen–Lynden-Bell–Sandage
[ELS] model), protogalaxies form in a large-scale simultaneous collapse
lasting about one hundred million years.¹⁰⁰ In bottom-up theories (such as
the Searle-Zinn [SZ] model), small structures such as globular clusters
form first, and then a number of such bodies accrete to form a larger
galaxy.¹⁰¹

Once protogalaxies began to form and contract, the first halo stars (called
Population III stars) appeared within them. These were composed almost
entirely of hydrogen and helium, and may have been massive. If so, these
huge stars would have quickly consumed their supply of fuel and became
supernovae, releasing heavy elements into the interstellar medium.¹⁰² This
first generation of stars re-ionized the surrounding neutral hydrogen,
creating expanding bubbles of space through which light could readily
travel.¹⁰³

In June 2015, astronomers reported evidence for Population III stars in the
Cosmos Redshift 7 galaxy at z = 6.60. Such stars are likely to have existed
in the very early universe (i.e., at high redshift), and may have started
the production of chemical elements heavier than hydrogen that are needed
for the later formation of planets and life as we know it.¹⁰⁴ ¹⁰⁵

Evolution

Within a billion years of a galaxy's formation, key structures begin to
appear. Globular clusters, the central supermassive black hole, and a
galactic bulge of metal-poor Population II stars form. The creation of a
supermassive black hole appears to play a key role in actively regulating
the growth of galaxies by limiting the total amount of additional matter
added.¹⁰⁶ During this early epoch, galaxies undergo a major burst of star
formation.¹⁰⁷

During the following two billion years, the accumulated matter settles into
a galactic disc.¹⁰⁸ A galaxy will continue to absorb infalling material
from high-velocity clouds and dwarf galaxies throughout its life.¹⁰⁹ This
matter is mostly hydrogen and helium. The cycle of stellar birth and death
slowly increases the abundance of heavy elements, eventually allowing the
formation of planets.¹¹⁰

Hubble eXtreme Deep Field (XDF)
XDF view field compared to the angular size of the Moon. Several thousand
galaxies, each consisting of billions of stars, are in this small view.
XDF (2012) view: Each light speck is a galaxy, some of which are as old as
13.2 billion years¹¹¹  – the observable universe is estimated to contain
200 billion galaxies.
XDF image shows (from left) fully mature galaxies, nearly mature galaxies
(from 5 to 9 billion years ago), protogalaxies, blazing with young stars
(beyond 9 billion years).

The evolution of galaxies can be significantly affected by interactions and
collisions. Mergers of galaxies were common during the early epoch, and the
majority of galaxies were peculiar in morphology.¹¹² Given the distances
between the stars, the great majority of stellar systems in colliding
galaxies will be unaffected. However, gravitational stripping of the
interstellar gas and dust that makes up the spiral arms produces a long
train of stars known as tidal tails. Examples of these formations can be
seen in NGC 4676¹¹³ or the Antennae Galaxies.¹¹⁴

The Milky Way galaxy and the nearby Andromeda Galaxy are moving toward each
other at about 130 km/s, and—depending upon the lateral movements—the two
might collide in about five to six billion years. Although the Milky Way
has never collided with a galaxy as large as Andromeda before, evidence of
past collisions of the Milky Way with smaller dwarf galaxies is
increasing.¹¹⁵

Such large-scale interactions are rare. As time passes, mergers of two
systems of equal size become less common. Most bright galaxies have
remained fundamentally unchanged for the last few billion years, and the
net rate of star formation probably also peaked approximately ten billion
years ago.¹¹⁶

Future trends

Spiral galaxies, like the Milky Way, produce new generations of stars as
long as they have dense molecular clouds of interstellar hydrogen in their
spiral arms.¹¹⁷ Elliptical galaxies are largely devoid of this gas, and so
form few new stars.¹¹⁸ The supply of star-forming material is finite; once
stars have converted the available supply of hydrogen into heavier
elements, new star formation will come to an end.¹¹⁹ ¹²⁰

The current era of star formation is expected to continue for up to one
hundred billion years, and then the "stellar age" will wind down after
about ten trillion to one hundred trillion years (10¹³–10¹⁴ years), as the
smallest, longest-lived stars in our universe, tiny red dwarfs, begin to
fade. At the end of the stellar age, galaxies will be composed of compact
objects: brown dwarfs, white dwarfs that are cooling or cold ("black
dwarfs"), neutron stars, and black holes. Eventually, as a result of
gravitational relaxation, all stars will either fall into central
supermassive black holes or be flung into intergalactic space as a result
of collisions.¹¹⁹ ¹²¹

Larger-scale structures

Main articles: Observable universe § Large-scale structure, Galaxy filament
and Galaxy groups and clusters

Deep sky surveys show that galaxies are often found in groups and clusters.
Solitary galaxies that have not significantly interacted with another
galaxy of comparable mass during the past billion years are relatively
scarce. Only about 5% of the galaxies surveyed have been found to be truly
isolated; however, these isolated formations may have interacted and even
merged with other galaxies in the past, and may still be orbited by
smaller, satellite galaxies. Isolated galaxies[note 2] can produce stars at
a higher rate than normal, as their gas is not being stripped by other
nearby galaxies.¹²²

On the largest scale, the Universe is continually expanding, resulting in
an average increase in the separation between individual galaxies (see
Hubble's law). Associations of galaxies can overcome this expansion on a
local scale through their mutual gravitational attraction. These
associations formed early in the Universe, as clumps of dark matter pulled
their respective galaxies together. Nearby groups later merged to form
larger-scale clusters. This on-going merger process (as well as an influx
of infalling gas) heats the inter-galactic gas within a cluster to very
high temperatures, reaching 30–100 megakelvins.¹²³ About 70–80% of the mass
in a cluster is in the form of dark matter, with 10–30% consisting of this
heated gas and the remaining few percent of the matter in the form of
galaxies.¹²⁴

Seyfert's Sextet is an example of a compact galaxy group.

Most galaxies in the Universe are gravitationally bound to a number of
other galaxies. These form a fractal-like hierarchical distribution of
clustered structures, with the smallest such associations being termed
groups. A group of galaxies is the most common type of galactic cluster,
and these formations contain a majority of the galaxies (as well as most of
the baryonic mass) in the Universe.¹²⁵ ¹²⁶ To remain gravitationally bound
to such a group, each member galaxy must have a sufficiently low velocity
to prevent it from escaping (see Virial theorem). If there is insufficient
kinetic energy, however, the group may evolve into a smaller number of
galaxies through mergers.¹²⁷

Clusters of galaxies consist of hundreds to thousands of galaxies bound
together by gravity.¹²⁸ Clusters of galaxies are often dominated by a
single giant elliptical galaxy, known as the brightest cluster galaxy,
which, over time, tidally destroys its satellite galaxies and adds their
mass to its own.¹²⁹

Superclusters contain tens of thousands of galaxies, which are found in
clusters, groups and sometimes individually. At the supercluster scale,
galaxies are arranged into sheets and filaments surrounding vast empty
voids.¹³⁰ Above this scale, the Universe appears to be the same in all
directions (isotropic and homogeneous).¹³¹

The Milky Way galaxy is a member of an association named the Local Group, a
relatively small group of galaxies that has a diameter of approximately one
megaparsec. The Milky Way and the Andromeda Galaxy are the two brightest
galaxies within the group; many of the other member galaxies are dwarf
companions of these two galaxies.¹³² The Local Group itself is a part of a
cloud-like structure within the Virgo Supercluster, a large, extended
structure of groups and clusters of galaxies centered on the Virgo
Cluster.¹³³ And the Virgo Supercluster itself is a part of the Pisces-Cetus
Supercluster Complex, a giant galaxy filament.

Multi-wavelength observation

See also: Observational astronomy
This ultraviolet image of Andromeda shows blue regions containing young,
massive stars.

The peak radiation of most stars lies in the visible spectrum, so the
observation of the stars that form galaxies has been a major component of
optical astronomy. It is also a favorable portion of the spectrum for
observing ionized H II regions, and for examining the distribution of dusty
arms.

The dust present in the interstellar medium is opaque to visual light. It
is more transparent to far-infrared, which can be used to observe the
interior regions of giant molecular clouds and galactic cores in great
detail.¹³⁴ Infrared is also used to observe distant, red-shifted galaxies
that were formed much earlier in the history of the Universe. Water vapor
and carbon dioxide absorb a number of useful portions of the infrared
spectrum, so high-altitude or space-based telescopes are used for infrared
astronomy.

The first non-visual study of galaxies, particularly active galaxies, was
made using radio frequencies. The atmosphere is nearly transparent to radio
between 5 MHz and 30 GHz. (The ionosphere blocks signals below this
range.)¹³⁵ Large radio interferometers have been used to map the active
jets emitted from active nuclei. Radio telescopes can also be used to
observe neutral hydrogen (via 21 cm radiation), including, potentially, the
non-ionized matter in the early Universe that later collapsed to form
galaxies.¹³⁶

Ultraviolet and X-ray telescopes can observe highly energetic galactic
phenomena. An ultraviolet flare was observed when a star in a distant
galaxy was torn apart from the tidal forces of a black hole.¹³⁷ The
distribution of hot gas in galactic clusters can be mapped by X-rays. The
existence of supermassive black holes at the cores of galaxies was
confirmed through X-ray astronomy.¹³⁸

  (London, England: H. Chapelle, 1750). From p.48: " … the stars are not
  infinitely dispersed and distributed in a promiscuous manner throughout
  all the mundane space, without order or design, … this phænomenon [is] no
  other than a certain effect arising from the observer's situation, … To a
  spectator placed in an indefinite space, … it [i.e., the Milky Way (Via

On page 73, Wright called the Milky Way the Vortex Magnus (the great
  whirlpool) and estimated its diameter at 8.64×10¹² miles (13.9×10¹² km).

Gamma ray

This article is about the term's use in physics. For other uses, see Gamma
ray (disambiguation).

Illustration of an emission of a gamma ray (γ) from an atomic nucleus
Gamma rays are emitted during nuclear fission in nuclear explosions.

Gamma radiation, also known as gamma rays, and denoted by the Greek letter
γ, refers to electromagnetic radiation of an extremely high frequency and
therefore consists of high-energy photons. Gamma rays are ionizing
radiation, and are thus biologically hazardous. They are classically
produced by the decay of atomic nuclei as they transition from a high
energy state to a lower state known as gamma decay, but may also be
produced by other processes. Paul Villard, a French chemist and physicist,
discovered gamma radiation in 1900, while studying radiation emitted from
radium. Villard's radiation was named "gamma rays" by Ernest Rutherford in
1903.

Natural sources of gamma rays on Earth include gamma decay from naturally
occurring radioisotopes, and secondary radiation from atmospheric
interactions with cosmic ray particles. Rare terrestrial natural sources
produce gamma rays that are not of a nuclear origin, such as lightning
strikes and terrestrial gamma-ray flashes. Additionally, gamma rays are
produced by a number of astronomical processes in which very high-energy
electrons are produced, that in turn cause secondary gamma rays via
bremsstrahlung, inverse Compton scattering, and synchrotron radiation.
However, a large fraction of such astronomical gamma rays are screened by
Earth's atmosphere and can only be detected by spacecraft.

Gamma rays typically have frequencies above 10 exahertz (or >10¹⁹ Hz), and
therefore have energies above 100 keV and wavelengths less than 10
picometers (10−12 meter), which is less than the diameter of an atom.
However, this is not a hard and fast definition, but rather only a
rule-of-thumb description for natural processes. Electromagnetic radiation
from radioactive decay of atomic nuclei is referred to as "gamma rays" no
matter its energy, so that there is no lower limit to gamma energy derived
from radioactive decay. This radiation commonly has energy of a few hundred
keV, and almost always less than 10 MeV. In astronomy, gamma rays are
defined by their energy, and no production process needs to be specified.
The energies of gamma rays from astronomical sources range to over 10 TeV,
an energy far too large to result from radioactive decay.¹ A notable
example is extremely powerful bursts of high-energy radiation referred to
as long duration gamma-ray bursts, of energies higher than can be produced
by radioactive decay. These bursts of gamma rays, thought to be due to the
collapse of stars called hypernovae, are the most powerful events so far
discovered in the cosmos.

History of discovery

The first gamma ray source to be discovered historically was the
radioactive decay process called gamma decay. In this type of decay, an
excited nucleus emits a gamma ray almost immediately upon formation (it is
now understood that a nuclear isomeric transition, however, can produce
inhibited gamma decay with a measurable and much longer half-life). Paul
Villard, a French chemist and physicist, discovered gamma radiation in
1900, while studying radiation emitted from radium. Villard knew that his
described radiation was more powerful than previously described types of
rays from radium, which included beta rays, first noted as "radioactivity"
by Henri Becquerel in 1896, and alpha rays, discovered as a less
penetrating form of radiation by Rutherford, in 1899. However, Villard did
not consider naming them as a different fundamental type.² ³ Villard's
radiation was recognized as being of a type fundamentally different from
previously named rays, by Ernest Rutherford, who in 1903 named Villard's
rays "gamma rays" by analogy with the beta and alpha rays that Rutherford
had differentiated in 1899.⁴ The "rays" emitted by radioactive elements
were named in order of their power to penetrate various materials, using
the first three letters of the Greek alphabet: alpha rays as the least
penetrating, followed by beta rays, followed by gamma rays as the most
penetrating. Rutherford also noted that gamma rays were not deflected (or
at least, not easily deflected) by a magnetic field, another property
making them unlike alpha and beta rays.

Gamma rays were first thought to be particles with mass, like alpha and
beta rays. Rutherford initially believed that they might be extremely fast
beta particles, but their failure to be deflected by a magnetic field
indicated that they had no charge.⁵ In 1914, gamma rays were observed to be
reflected from crystal surfaces, proving that they were electromagnetic
radiation.⁵ Rutherford and his coworker Edward Andrade measured the
wavelengths of gamma rays from radium, and found that they were similar to
X-rays, but with shorter wavelengths and (thus) higher frequency. This was
eventually recognized as giving them also more energy per photon, as soon
as the latter term became generally accepted. A gamma decay was then
understood to usually emit a single gamma photon.

Sources of gamma rays

Natural sources of gamma rays on Earth include gamma decay from naturally
occurring radioisotopes such as potassium-40, and also as a secondary
radiation from various atmospheric interactions with cosmic ray particles.
Some rare terrestrial natural sources that produce gamma rays that are not
of a nuclear origin, are lightning strikes and terrestrial gamma-ray
flashes, which produce high energy emissions from natural high-energy
voltages. Gamma rays are produced by a number of astronomical processes in
which very high-energy electrons are produced. Such electrons produce
secondary gamma rays by the mechanisms of bremsstrahlung, inverse Compton
scattering and synchrotron radiation. A large fraction of such astronomical
gamma rays are screened by Earth's atmosphere and must be detected by
spacecraft. Notable artificial sources of gamma rays include fission such
as occurs in nuclear reactors, and high energy physics experiments, such as
neutral pion decay and nuclear fusion.

General characteristics

The distinction between X-rays and gamma rays has changed in recent
decades. Originally, the electromagnetic radiation emitted by X-ray tubes
almost invariably had a longer wavelength than the radiation (gamma rays)
emitted by radioactive nuclei.⁶ Older literature distinguished between X-
and gamma radiation on the basis of wavelength, with radiation shorter than
some arbitrary wavelength, such as 10−11 m, defined as gamma rays.⁷
However, with artificial sources now able to duplicate any electromagnetic
radiation that originates in the nucleus, as well as far higher energies,
the wavelengths characteristic of radioactive gamma ray sources vs. other
types, now completely overlap. Thus, gamma rays are now usually
distinguished by their origin: X-rays are emitted by definition by
electrons outside the nucleus, while gamma rays are emitted by the
nucleus.⁶ ⁸ ⁹ ¹⁰ Exceptions to this convention occur in astronomy, where
gamma decay is seen in the afterglow of certain supernovas, but other high
energy processes known to involve other than radioactive decay are still
classed as sources of gamma radiation.

Naming conventions and overlap in terminology

In the past, the distinction between X-rays and gamma rays was based on
energy, with gamma rays being considered a higher-energy version of
electromagnetic radiation. However, modern high-energy X-rays produced by
linear accelerators for megavoltage treatment in cancer often have higher
energy (4 to 25 MeV) than do most classical gamma rays produced by nuclear
gamma decay. One of the most common gamma ray emitting isotopes used in
diagnostic nuclear medicine, technetium-99m, produces gamma radiation of
the same energy (140 keV) as that produced by diagnostic X-ray machines,
but of significantly lower energy than therapeutic photons from linear
particle accelerators. In the medical community today, the convention that
radiation produced by nuclear decay is the only type referred to as "gamma"
radiation is still respected.

Because of this broad overlap in energy ranges, in physics the two types of
electromagnetic radiation are now often defined by their origin: X-rays are
emitted by electrons (either in orbitals outside of the nucleus, or while
being accelerated to produce bremsstrahlung-type radiation),¹² while gamma
rays are emitted by the nucleus or by means of other particle decays or
annihilation events. There is no lower limit to the energy of photons
produced by nuclear reactions, and thus ultraviolet or lower energy photons
produced by these processes would also be defined as "gamma rays".¹³ The
only naming-convention that is still universally respected is the rule that
electromagnetic radiation that is known to be of atomic nuclear origin is
always referred to as "gamma rays," and never as X-rays. However, in
physics and astronomy, the converse convention (that all gamma rays are
considered to be of nuclear origin) is frequently violated.

In astronomy, higher energy gamma and X-rays are defined by energy, since
the processes that produce them may be uncertain and photon energy, not
origin, determines the required astronomical detectors needed.¹⁴ High
energy photons occur in nature that are known to be produced by processes
other than nuclear decay but are still referred to as gamma radiation. An
example is "gamma rays" from lightning discharges at 10 to 20 MeV, and
known to be produced by the bremsstrahlung mechanism.

Another example is gamma-ray bursts, now known to be produced from
processes too powerful to involve simple collections of atoms undergoing
radioactive decay. This has led to the realization that many gamma rays
produced in astronomical processes result not from radioactive decay or
particle annihilation, but rather in much the same manner as the production
of X-rays. Although gamma rays in astronomy are discussed below as
non-radioactive events, in fact a few gamma rays are known in astronomy to
originate explicitly from gamma decay of nuclei (as demonstrated by their
spectra and emission half life). A classic example is that of supernova SN
1987A, which emits an "afterglow" of gamma-ray photons from the decay of
newly made radioactive nickel-56 and cobalt-56. Most gamma rays in
astronomy, however, arise by other mechanisms. Astronomical literature
tends to write "gamma-ray" with a hyphen, by analogy to X-rays, rather than
in a way analogous to alpha rays and beta rays. This notation tends to
subtly stress the non-nuclear source of most astronomical "gamma-rays".

Units of measure and exposure

The measure of gamma rays' ionizing ability is called the exposure:

- The coulomb per kilogram (C/kg) is the SI unit of ionizing radiation
  exposure, and is the amount of radiation required to create 1 coulomb of
  charge of each polarity in 1 kilogram of matter.
- The röntgen (R) is an obsolete traditional unit of exposure, which
  represented the amount of radiation required to create 1 esu of charge of
  each polarity in 1 cubic centimeter of dry air. 1 röntgen = 2.58×10−4
  C/kg

However, the effect of gamma and other ionizing radiation on living tissue
is more closely related to the amount of energy deposited rather than the
charge. This is called the absorbed dose:

- The gray (Gy), which has units of (J/kg), is the SI unit of absorbed
  dose, and is the amount of radiation required to deposit 1 joule of
  energy in 1 kilogram of any kind of matter.
- The rad is the deprecated CGS unit, equal to 0.01 J deposited per kg. 100
  rad = 1 Gy.

The equivalent dose is the measure of the biological effect of radiation on
human tissue. For gamma rays, it is equal to the absorbed dose.

- The sievert (Sv) is the SI unit of equivalent dose, which for gamma rays
  is numerically equal to the gray (Gy).
- The rem is the deprecated CGS unit of equivalent dose. For gamma rays it
  is equal to the rad or 0.01 J of energy deposited per kg. 1 Sv = 100 rem.

Properties

Shielding

Shielding from gamma rays requires large amounts of mass, in contrast to
alpha particles, which can be blocked by paper or skin, and beta particles,
which can be shielded by foil. Gamma rays are better absorbed by materials
with high atomic numbers and high density, although neither effect is
important compared to the total mass per area in the path of the gamma ray.
For this reason, a lead shield is only modestly better (20–30% better) as a
gamma shield than an equal mass of another shielding material, such as
aluminium, concrete, water or soil; lead's major advantage is not in lower
weight, but rather its compactness due to its higher density. Protective
clothing, goggles and respirators can protect from internal contact with or
ingestion of alpha or beta emitting particles, but provide no protection
from gamma radiation from external sources.

The higher the energy of the gamma rays, the thicker the shielding made
from the same shielding material is required. Materials for shielding gamma
rays are typically measured by the thickness required to reduce the
intensity of the gamma rays by one half (the half value layer or HVL). For
example, gamma rays that require 1 cm (0.4″) of lead to reduce their
intensity by 50% will also have their intensity reduced in half by 4.1 cm
of granite rock, 6 cm (2½″) of concrete, or 9 cm (3½″) of packed soil.
However, the mass of this much concrete or soil is only 20–30% greater than
that of lead with the same absorption capability. Depleted uranium is used
for shielding in portable gamma ray sources, but here the savings in weight
over lead are larger, as portable sources' shape resembles a sphere to some
extent, and the volume of a sphere is dependent on the cube of the radius;
so a source with its radius cut in half will have its volume reduced by an
eighth, which will more than compensate uranium's greater density (as well
as reducing bulk). In a nuclear power plant, shielding can be provided by
steel and concrete in the pressure and particle containment vessel, while
water provides a radiation shielding of fuel rods during storage or
transport into the reactor core. The loss of water or removal of a "hot"
fuel assembly into the air would result in much higher radiation levels
than when kept under water.

Matter interaction

When a gamma ray passes through matter, the probability for absorption is
proportional to the thickness of the layer, the density of the material,
and the absorption cross section of the material. The total absorption
shows an exponential decrease of intensity with distance from the incident
surface:

I(x) = I_0 ·e ^{-μx}

where x is the thickness of the material from the incident surface, μ = nσ
is the absorption coefficient, measured in cm−1, n the number of atoms per
cm³ of the material (atomic density) and σ the absorption cross section in
cm².

As it passes through matter, gamma radiation ionizes via three processes:
the photoelectric effect, Compton scattering, and pair production.

- Photoelectric effect: This describes the case in which a gamma photon
  interacts with and transfers its energy to an atomic electron, causing
  the ejection of that electron from the atom. The kinetic energy of the
  resulting photoelectron is equal to the energy of the incident gamma
  photon minus the energy that originally bound the electron to the atom
  (binding energy). The photoelectric effect is the dominant energy
  transfer mechanism for X-ray and gamma ray photons with energies below 50
  keV (thousand electron volts), but it is much less important at higher
  energies.
- Compton scattering: This is an interaction in which an incident gamma
  photon loses enough energy to an atomic electron to cause its ejection,
  with the remainder of the original photon's energy emitted as a new,
  lower energy gamma photon whose emission direction is different from that
  of the incident gamma photon, hence the term "scattering". The
  probability of Compton scattering decreases with increasing photon
  energy. Compton scattering is thought to be the principal absorption
  mechanism for gamma rays in the intermediate energy range 100 keV to 10
  MeV. Compton scattering is relatively independent of the atomic number of
  the absorbing material, which is why very dense materials like lead are
  only modestly better shields, on a per weight basis, than are less dense
  materials.
- Pair production: This becomes possible with gamma energies exceeding 1.02
  MeV, and becomes important as an absorption mechanism at energies over 5
  MeV (see illustration at right, for lead). By interaction with the
  electric field of a nucleus, the energy of the incident photon is
  converted into the mass of an electron-positron pair. Any gamma energy in
  excess of the equivalent rest mass of the two particles (totaling at
  least 1.02 MeV) appears as the kinetic energy of the pair and in the
  recoil of the emitting nucleus. At the end of the positron's range, it
  combines with a free electron, and the two annihilate, and the entire
  mass of these two is then converted into two gamma photons of at least
  0.51 MeV energy each (or higher according to the kinetic energy of the
  annihilated particles).

The secondary electrons (and/or positrons) produced in any of these three
processes frequently have enough energy to produce much ionization
themselves.

Additionally, gamma rays, particularly high energy ones, can interact with
atomic nuclei resulting in ejection of particles in photodisintegration, or
in some cases, even nuclear fission (photofission).

Light interaction

High-energy (from 80 GeV to ~10 TeV) gamma rays arriving from far-distant
quasars are used to estimate the extragalactic background light in the
universe: The highest-energy rays interact more readily with the background
light photons and thus the density of the background light may be estimated
by analyzing the incoming gamma ray spectra.¹⁵ ¹⁶

Gamma ray production

Gamma rays can be produced by a wide range of phenomena, both nuclear and
non-nuclear.

Radioactive decay (gamma decay)

Main article: Nuclear isomer

Gamma rays are produced during gamma decay, which normally occurs after
other forms of decay occur, such as alpha or beta decay. An excited nucleus
can decay by the emission of an α or β particle. The daughter nucleus that
results is usually left in an excited state. It can then decay to a lower
energy state by emitting a gamma ray photon, in a process called gamma
decay.

The emission of a gamma ray from an excited nucleus typically, requires
only 10−12 seconds, and is thus nearly instantaneous. Gamma decay may also
follow nuclear reactions such as neutron capture, nuclear fission, or
nuclear fusion. Gamma decay is also a mode of relaxation of many excited
states of atomic nuclei following other types of radioactive decay, such as
beta decay, so long as these states possess the necessary component of
nuclear spin. When high-energy gamma rays, electrons, or protons bombard
materials, the excited atoms emit characteristic "secondary" gamma rays,
which are products of the creation of excited nuclear states in the
bombarded atoms. Such transitions, a form of nuclear gamma fluorescence,
form a topic in nuclear physics called gamma spectroscopy). Formation of
fluorescent gamma rays are a rapid subtype of radioactive gamma decay.

In certain cases, the excited nuclear state that follows the emission of a
beta particle or other type of excitation, may be more stable than average,
and is termed a metastable excited state, if its decay takes (at least) 100
to 1000 times longer than the average 10−12 seconds. Such relatively
long-lived excited nuclei are termed nuclear isomers, and their decays are
termed isomeric transitions. Such nuclei have half-lifes that are more
easily measurable, and rare nuclear isomers are able to stay in their
excited state for minutes, hours, days, or occasionally far longer, before
emitting a gamma ray. The process of isomeric transition is therefore
similar to any gamma emission, but differs in that it involves the
intermediate metastable excited state(s) of the nuclei. Metastable states
are often characterized by high nuclear spin, requiring a change in spin of
several units or more with gamma decay, instead of a single unit transition
that occurs in only 10−12 seconds. The rate of gamma decay is also slowed
when the energy of excitation of the nucleus is small.¹⁷

An emitted gamma ray from any type of excited state may transfer its energy
directly to any electrons, but most probably to one of the K shell
electrons of the atom, causing it to be ejected from that atom, in a
process generally termed the photoelectric effect (external gamma rays and
ultraviolet rays may also cause this effect). The photoelectric effect
should not be confused with the internal conversion process, in which a
gamma ray photon is not produced as an intermediate particle (rather, a
"virtual gamma ray" may be thought to mediate the process).

Gamma rays, X-rays, visible light, and radio waves are all forms of
electromagnetic radiation. The only difference is the frequency and hence
the energy of those photons. Gamma rays are generally the most energetic of
these, although a broad overlap with X-ray energies occurs. An example of
gamma ray production follows:

First 60Co decays to excited 60Ni by beta decay emission of an electron of
0.31 MeV. Then the excited 60Ni decays to the ground state (see nuclear
shell model) by emitting gamma rays in succession of 1.17 MeV followed by
1.33 MeV. This path is followed 99.88% of the time:

Another example is the alpha decay of 241Am to form 237Np; which is
followed by gamma emission. In some cases, the gamma emission spectrum of
the daughter nucleus is quite simple, (e.g. 60Co/60Ni) while in other
cases, such as with (241Am/237Np and 192Ir/192Pt), the gamma emission
spectrum is complex, revealing that a series of nuclear energy levels
exist.

Because a beta decay is accompanied by the emission of a neutrino that also
carries a varying amount of energy away, the beta emission spectrum does
not have sharp lines, but instead is broad. Hence, it is not possible to
describe the different energy levels found in the nucleus using beta decay
energies alone.

Gamma spectroscopy is the study of the energetic transitions in atomic
nuclei, which are generally associated with the absorption or emission of
gamma rays. As in optical spectroscopy (see Franck Condon effect) the
absorption of gamma rays by a nucleus is especially likely (i.e., peaks in
a "resonance") when the energy of the gamma ray is the same as that of an
energy transition in the nucleus. In the case of gamma rays, such a
resonance is seen in the technique of Mössbauer spectroscopy. In the
Mössbauer effect the narrow resonance absorption for nuclear gamma
absorption can be successfully attained by physically immobilizing atomic
nuclei in a crystal. The immobilization of nuclei at both ends of a gamma
resonance interaction is required so that no gamma energy is lost to the
kinetic energy of recoiling nuclei at either the emitting or absorbing end
of a gamma transition. Such loss of energy causes gamma ray resonance
absorption to fail. However, when emitted gamma rays carry essentially all
of the energy of the atomic nuclear de-excitation that produces them, this
energy is also sufficient to excite the same energy state in a second
immobilized nucleus of the same type.

Gamma rays from sources other than radioactive decay

Main article: Gamma-ray astronomy

A few gamma rays in astronomy are known to arise from gamma decay (see
discussion of SN1987A) but most do not.

Photons from astrophysical sources that carry energy in the gamma radiation
range are often explicitly called gamma-radiation. In addition to nuclear
emissions, they are often produced by sub-atomic particle and
particle-photon interactions. Those include electron-positron annihilation,
neutral pion decay, bremsstrahlung, inverse Compton scattering, and
synchrotron radiation.

- Terrestrial thunderstorms: Thunderstorms can produce a brief pulse of
  gamma radiation called a terrestrial gamma-ray flash. These gamma rays
  are thought to be produced by high intensity static electric fields
  accelerating electrons, which then produce gamma rays by bremsstrahlung
  as they collide with and are slowed by atoms in the atmosphere. Gamma
  rays up to 100 MeV can be emitted by terrestrial thunderstorms, and were
  discovered by space-borne observatories. This raises the possibility of
  health risks to passengers and crew on aircraft flying in or near
  thunderclouds.¹⁸

Extraterrestrial, high energy gamma rays include the gamma ray background
produced when cosmic rays (either high speed electrons or protons) collide
with ordinary matter, producing pair-production gamma rays at 511 keV.
Alternatively, bremsstrahlung are produced at energies of tens of MeV or
more when cosmic ray electrons interact with nuclei of sufficiently high
atomic number (see gamma ray image of the Moon at the beginning of this
article, for illustration).

- Pulsars and magnetars: The gamma ray sky (see illustration at right) is
  dominated by the more common and longer-term production of gamma rays
  that emanate from pulsars within the Milky Way. Sources from the rest of
  the sky are mostly quasars. Pulsars are thought to be neutron stars with
  magnetic fields that produce focused beams of radiation, and are far less
  energetic, more common, and much nearer sources (typically seen only in
  our own galaxy) than are quasars or the rarer gamma-ray burst sources of
  gamma rays. Pulsars have relatively long-lived magnetic fields that
  produce focused beams of relativistic speed charged particles, which emit
  gamma rays (bremsstrahlung) when those strike gas or dust in their nearby
  medium, and are decelerated. This is a similar mechanism to the
  production of high energy photons in megavoltage radiation therapy
  machines (see bremsstrahlung). The "inverse Compton effect", in which
  charged particles (usually electrons) impart energy to low-energy photons
  boosting them to higher energy photons. Such impacts of photons on
  relativistic charged particle beams is another possible mechanism of
  gamma ray production. Neutron stars with a very high magnetic field
  (magnetars), thought to produce astronomical soft gamma repeaters, are
  another relatively long-lived star-powered source of gamma radiation.
- Quasars and active galaxies: More powerful gamma rays from very distant
  quasars and closer active galaxies are thought to have a gamma ray
  production source similar to a particle accelerator. High energy
  electrons produced by the quasar, and subjected to inverse Compton
  scattering, synchrotron radiation, or bremsstrahlung, are the likely
  source of the gamma rays from those objects. It is thought that as a
  supermassive black hole at the center of such galaxies provide the power
  source that intermittently destroys stars and focuses the resulting
  charged particles into beams that emerge from their rotational poles.
  When those beams interact with gas, dust, and lower energy photons they
  produce X-rays and gamma rays. These sources are known to fluctuate with
  durations of a few weeks, suggesting their relatively small size (less
  than a few light-weeks across). Such sources of gamma and X-rays are the
  most commonly visible high intensity sources outside our galaxy. They
  shine not in bursts (see illustration), but relatively continuously when
  viewed with gamma ray telescopes. The power of a typical quasar is about
  10⁴⁰ watts, a small fraction of which is gamma radiation. Much of the
  rest is emitted as electromagnetic waves of all frequencies, including
  radio waves.
- Gamma-ray bursts: The most intense sources of gamma rays, are also the
  most intense sources of any type of electromagnetic radiation presently
  known. They are the "long duration burst" sources of gamma rays in
  astronomy ("long" in this context, meaning a few tens of seconds), and
  they are rare compared with the sources discussed above. By contrast,
  "short" gamma-ray bursts, which are not associated with supernovae, are
  thought to produce gamma rays during the collision of pairs of neutron
  stars, or a neutron star and a black hole. Such bursts last two seconds
  or less, and are of far lower energy than the "long" bursts (only sources
  in our galaxy are detectable for that reason).¹⁹

The so-called long-duration gamma-ray bursts produce a total energy output
of about 10⁴⁴ joules (as much energy as our Sun will produce in its entire
life-time) but in a period of only 20 to 40 seconds. Gamma rays are
approximately 50% of the total energy output. The leading hypotheses for
the mechanism of production of these highest-known intensity beams of
radiation, are inverse Compton scattering and synchrotron radiation from
high-energy charged particles. These processes occur as relativistic
charged particles leave the region of the event horizon of a newly formed
black hole created during supernova explosion. The beam of particles moving
at relativistic speeds are focused for a few tens of seconds by the
magnetic field of the exploding hypernova. The fusion explosion of the
hypernova drives the energetics of the process. If the narrowly directed
beam happens to be pointed toward the Earth, it shines at gamma ray
frequencies with such intensity, that it can be detected even at distances
of up to 10 billion light years, which is close to the edge of the visible
universe.

Health effects

Main article: Sievert

Gamma rays cause damage at a cellular level and are penetrating, causing
diffuse damage throughout the body. However, they are less ionising than
alpha or beta particles, which are less penetrating.

Low levels of gamma rays cause a stochastic health risk, which for
radiation dose assessment is defined as the probability of cancer induction
and genetic damage.²⁰ High doses produce deterministic effects, which is
the severity of acute tissue damage that is certain to happen. These
effects are compared to the physical quantity absorbed dose measured by the
unit gray (Gy).²¹

Uses

Gamma rays provide information about some of the most energetic phenomena
in the universe; however, they are largely absorbed by the Earth's
atmosphere. Instruments aboard high-altitude balloons and satellites
missions, such as the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope, provide our only
view of the universe in gamma rays.

Gamma-induced molecular changes can also be used to alter the properties of
semi-precious stones, and is often used to change white topaz into blue

Non-contact industrial sensors commonly use sources of gamma radiation in
the refining, mining, chemical, food, soaps and detergents, and pulp and
paper industries, for the measurement of levels, density, and thicknesses.
Typically, these use Co-60 or Cs-137 isotopes as the radiation source.

In the US, gamma ray detectors are beginning to be used as part of the
Container Security Initiative (CSI). These machines are advertised to be
able to scan 30 containers per hour.

Gamma radiation is often used to kill living organisms, in a process called
irradiation. Applications of this include the sterilization of medical
equipment (as an alternative to autoclaves or chemical means), the removal
of decay-causing bacteria from many foods and the prevention of the
sprouting of fruit and vegetables to maintain freshness and flavor.

Despite their cancer-causing properties, gamma rays are also used to treat
some types of cancer, since the rays kill cancer cells also. In the
procedure called gamma-knife surgery, multiple concentrated beams of gamma
rays are directed to the growth in order to kill the cancerous cells. The
beams are aimed from different angles to concentrate the radiation on the
growth while minimizing damage to surrounding tissues.

Gamma rays are also used for diagnostic purposes in nuclear medicine in
imaging techniques. A number of different gamma-emitting radioisotopes are
used. For example, in a PET scan a radiolabeled sugar called
fludeoxyglucose emits positrons that are annihilated by electrons,
producing pairs of gamma rays that highlight cancer as the cancer often has
a higher metabolic rate than the surrounding tissues. The most common gamma
emitter used in medical applications is the nuclear isomer technetium-99m
which emits gamma rays in the same energy range as diagnostic X-rays. When
this radionuclide tracer is administered to a patient, a gamma camera can
be used to form an image of the radioisotope's distribution by detecting
the gamma radiation emitted (see also SPECT). Depending on which molecule
has been labeled with the tracer, such techniques can be employed to
diagnose a wide range of conditions (for example, the spread of cancer to
the bones via bone scan).

Body response

When gamma radiation breaks DNA molecules, a cell may be able to repair the
damaged genetic material, within limits. However, a study of Rothkamm and
Lobrich has shown that this repair process works well after high-dose
exposure but is much slower than in the case of a low-dose exposure.²²

Risk assessment

The natural outdoor exposure in Great Britain ranges from 0.1 to 0.5 µSv/h
with significant increase around known nuclear and contaminated sites.²³
Natural exposure to gamma rays is about 1 to 2 mSv per year, and the
average total amount of radiation received in one year per inhabitant in
the USA is 3.6 mSv.²⁴ There is a small increase in the dose, due to
naturally occurring gamma radiation, around small particles of high atomic
number materials in the human body caused by the photoelectric effect.²⁵

By comparison, the radiation dose from chest radiography (about 0.06 mSv)
is a fraction of the annual naturally occurring background radiation
dose.²⁶ A chest CT delivers 5 to 8 mSv. A whole-body PET/CT scan can
deliver 14 to 32 mSv depending on the protocol.²⁷ The dose from fluoroscopy
of the stomach is much higher, approximately 50 mSv (14 times the annual
yearly background).

An acute full-body equivalent single exposure dose of 1 Sv (1000 mSv)
causes slight blood changes, but 2.0–3.5 Sv (2.0–3.5 Gy) causes very severe
syndrome of nausea, hair loss, and hemorrhaging, and will cause death in a
sizable number of cases—-about 10% to 35% without medical treatment. A dose
of 5 Sv²⁸ (5 Gy) is considered approximately the LD₅₀ (lethal dose for 50%
of exposed population) for an acute exposure to radiation even with
standard medical treatment. A dose higher than 5 Sv (5 Gy) brings an
increasing chance of death above 50%. Above 7.5–10 Sv (7.5–10 Gy) to the
entire body, even extraordinary treatment, such as bone-marrow transplants,
will not prevent the death of the individual exposed (see Radiation
poisoning). (Doses much larger than this may, however, be delivered to
selected parts of the body in the course of radiation therapy.)

For low dose exposure, for example among nuclear workers, who receive an
average yearly radiation dose of 19 mSv, the risk of dying from cancer
(excluding leukemia) increases by 2 percent. For a dose of 100 mSv, the
risk increase is 10 percent. By comparison, risk of dying from cancer was
increased by 32 percent for the survivors of the atomic bombing of
Hiroshima and Nagasaki.²⁹

Gravity

For other uses, see Gravity (disambiguation).
"Gravitation" and "Law of Gravity" redirect here. For other uses, see
Gravitation (disambiguation) and Law of Gravity (disambiguation).

Gravity or gravitation is a natural phenomenon by which all things with
mass are brought towards (or 'gravitate' towards) one another including
stars, planets, galaxies and even light and sub-atomic particles. Gravity
is responsible for the complexity in the universe, by creating spheres of
hydrogen, igniting them under pressure to form stars and grouping them into
galaxies. Without gravity, the universe would be an uncomplicated one,
existing without thermal energy and composed only of equally spaced
particles. On Earth, gravity gives weight to physical objects and causes
the tides. Gravity has an infinite range, and it cannot be absorbed,
transformed, or shielded against.

Gravity is most accurately described by the general theory of relativity
(proposed by Albert Einstein in 1915) which describes gravity, not as a
force, but as a consequence of the curvature of spacetime caused by the
uneven distribution of mass/energy; and resulting in time dilation, where
time lapses more slowly in strong gravitation. However, for most
applications, gravity is well approximated by Newton's law of universal
gravitation, which postulates that gravity is a force where two bodies of
mass are directly drawn (or 'attracted') to each other according to a
mathematical relationship, where the attractive force is proportional to
the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the
distance between them. This is considered to occur over an infinite range,
such that all bodies (with mass) in the universe are drawn to each other no
matter how far they are apart.

Gravity is the weakest of the four fundamental interactions of nature. The
gravitational attraction is approximately 10−38 times the strength of the
strong force (i.e. gravity is 38 orders of magnitude weaker), 10−36 times
the strength of the electromagnetic force, and 10−29 times the strength of
the weak force. As a consequence, gravity has a negligible influence on the
behavior of sub-atomic particles, and plays no role in determining the
internal properties of everyday matter (but see quantum gravity). On the
other hand, gravity is the dominant force at the macroscopic scale, that is
the cause of the formation, shape, and trajectory (orbit) of astronomical
bodies, including those of asteroids, comets, planets, stars, and galaxies.
It is responsible for causing the Earth and the other planets to orbit the
Sun; for causing the Moon to orbit the Earth; for the formation of tides;
for natural convection, by which fluid flow occurs under the influence of a
density gradient and gravity; for heating the interiors of forming stars
and planets to very high temperatures; for solar system, galaxy, stellar
formation and evolution; and for various other phenomena observed on Earth
and throughout the universe.

In pursuit of a theory of everything, the merging of general relativity and
quantum mechanics (or quantum field theory) into a more general theory of
quantum gravity has become an area of research.

History of gravitational theory

Main article: History of gravitational theory

Scientific revolution

Modern work on gravitational theory began with the work of Galileo Galilei
in the late 16th and early 17th centuries. In his famous (though possibly
apocryphal¹ ) experiment dropping balls from the Tower of Pisa, and later
with careful measurements of balls rolling down inclines, Galileo showed
that gravity accelerates all objects at the same rate. This was a major
departure from Aristotle's belief that heavier objects accelerate faster.²
Galileo postulated air resistance as the reason that lighter objects may
fall more slowly in an atmosphere. Galileo's work set the stage for the
formulation of Newton's theory of gravity.

Newton's theory of gravitation

Main article: Newton's law of universal gravitation

In 1687, English mathematician Sir Isaac Newton published Principia, which
hypothesizes the inverse-square law of universal gravitation. In his own
words, "I deduced that the forces which keep the planets in their orbs must
[be] reciprocally as the squares of their distances from the centers about
which they revolve: and thereby compared the force requisite to keep the
Moon in her Orb with the force of gravity at the surface of the Earth; and
found them answer pretty nearly."³ The equation is the following:

F = G \frac{m₁ ₘ₂}{r²}

Where F is the force, m₁ and m₂ are the masses of the objects interacting,
r is the distance between the centers of the masses and G is the
gravitational constant.

Newton's theory enjoyed its greatest success when it was used to predict
the existence of Neptune based on motions of Uranus that could not be
accounted for by the actions of the other planets. Calculations by both
John Couch Adams and Urbain Le Verrier predicted the general position of
the planet, and Le Verrier's calculations are what led Johann Gottfried
Galle to the discovery of Neptune.

A discrepancy in Mercury's orbit pointed out flaws in Newton's theory. By
the end of the 19th century, it was known that its orbit showed slight
perturbations that could not be accounted for entirely under Newton's
theory, but all searches for another perturbing body (such as a planet
orbiting the Sun even closer than Mercury) had been fruitless. The issue
was resolved in 1915 by Albert Einstein's new theory of general relativity,
which accounted for the small discrepancy in Mercury's orbit.

Although Newton's theory has been superseded by the Einstein's general
relativity, most modern non-relativistic gravitational calculations are
still made using the Newton's theory because it is simpler to work with and
it gives sufficiently accurate results for most applications involving
sufficiently small masses, speeds and energies.

Equivalence principle

The equivalence principle, explored by a succession of researchers
including Galileo, Loránd Eötvös, and Einstein, expresses the idea that all
objects fall in the same way. The simplest way to test the weak equivalence
principle is to drop two objects of different masses or compositions in a
vacuum and see whether they hit the ground at the same time. Such
experiments demonstrate that all objects fall at the same rate when other
forces (such as air resistance and electromagnetic effects) are negligible.
More sophisticated tests use a torsion balance of a type invented by
Eötvös. Satellite experiments, for example STEP, are planned for more
accurate experiments in space.⁴

Formulations of the equivalence principle include:

- The weak equivalence principle: The trajectory of a point mass in a
  gravitational field depends only on its initial position and velocity,
  and is independent of its composition.⁵
- The Einsteinian equivalence principle: The outcome of any local
  non-gravitational experiment in a freely falling laboratory is
  independent of the velocity of the laboratory and its location in
  spacetime.⁶
- The strong equivalence principle requiring both of the above.

General relativity

See also: Introduction to general relativity

In general relativity, the effects of gravitation are ascribed to spacetime
curvature instead of a force. The starting point for general relativity is
the equivalence principle, which equates free fall with inertial motion and
describes free-falling inertial objects as being accelerated relative to
non-inertial observers on the ground.⁷ ⁸ In Newtonian physics, however, no
such acceleration can occur unless at least one of the objects is being
operated on by a force.

Einstein proposed that spacetime is curved by matter, and that free-falling
objects are moving along locally straight paths in curved spacetime. These
straight paths are called geodesics. Like Newton's first law of motion,
Einstein's theory states that if a force is applied on an object, it would
deviate from a geodesic. For instance, we are no longer following geodesics
while standing because the mechanical resistance of the Earth exerts an
upward force on us, and we are non-inertial on the ground as a result. This
explains why moving along the geodesics in spacetime is considered
inertial.

Einstein discovered the field equations of general relativity, which relate
the presence of matter and the curvature of spacetime and are named after
him. The Einstein field equations are a set of 10 simultaneous, non-linear,
differential equations. The solutions of the field equations are the
components of the metric tensor of spacetime. A metric tensor describes a
geometry of spacetime. The geodesic paths for a spacetime are calculated
from the metric tensor.

Notable solutions of the Einstein field equations include:

- The Schwarzschild solution, which describes spacetime surrounding a
  spherically symmetric non-rotating uncharged massive object. For compact
  enough objects, this solution generated a black hole with a central
  singularity. For radial distances from the center which are much greater
  than the Schwarzschild radius, the accelerations predicted by the
  Schwarzschild solution are practically identical to those predicted by
  Newton's theory of gravity.
- The Reissner-Nordström solution, in which the central object has an
  electrical charge. For charges with a geometrized length which are less
  than the geometrized length of the mass of the object, this solution
  produces black holes with two event horizons.
- The Kerr solution for rotating massive objects. This solution also
  produces black holes with multiple event horizons.
- The Kerr-Newman solution for charged, rotating massive objects. This
  solution also produces black holes with multiple event horizons.
- The cosmological Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker solution, which
  predicts the expansion of the universe.

The tests of general relativity included the following:⁹

- General relativity accounts for the anomalous perihelion precession of
  Mercury.¹⁰
- The prediction that time runs slower at lower potentials has been
  confirmed by the Pound–Rebka experiment, the Hafele–Keating experiment,
  and the GPS.
- The prediction of the deflection of light was first confirmed by Arthur
  Stanley Eddington from his observations during the Solar eclipse of May
  29, 1919.¹¹ ¹² Eddington measured starlight deflections twice those
  predicted by Newtonian corpuscular theory, in accordance with the
  predictions of general relativity. However, his interpretation of the
  results was later disputed.¹³ More recent tests using radio
  interferometric measurements of quasars passing behind the Sun have more
  accurately and consistently confirmed the deflection of light to the
  degree predicted by general relativity.¹⁴ See also gravitational lens.
- The time delay of light passing close to a massive object was first
  identified by Irwin I. Shapiro in 1964 in interplanetary spacecraft
  signals.
- Gravitational radiation has been indirectly confirmed through studies of
  binary pulsars.
- Alexander Friedmann in 1922 found that Einstein equations have
  non-stationary solutions (even in the presence of the cosmological
  constant). In 1927 Georges Lemaître showed that static solutions of the
  Einstein equations, which are possible in the presence of the
  cosmological constant, are unstable, and therefore the static universe
  envisioned by Einstein could not exist. Later, in 1931, Einstein himself
  agreed with the results of Friedmann and Lemaître. Thus general
  relativity predicted that the Universe had to be non-static—it had to
  either expand or contract. The expansion of the universe discovered by
  Edwin Hubble in 1929 confirmed this prediction.¹⁵
- The theory's prediction of frame dragging was consistent with the recent
  Gravity Probe B results.¹⁶
- General relativity predicts that light should lose its energy when
  travelling away from the massive bodies. The group of Radek Wojtak of the
  Niels Bohr Institute at the University of Copenhagen collected data from
  8000 galaxy clusters and found that the light coming from the cluster
  centers tended to be red-shifted compared to the cluster edges,
  confirming the energy loss due to gravity.¹⁷

Gravity and quantum mechanics

Main articles: Graviton and Quantum gravity

In the decades after the discovery of general relativity, it was realized
that general relativity is incompatible with quantum mechanics.¹⁸ It is
possible to describe gravity in the framework of quantum field theory like
the other fundamental forces, such that the attractive force of gravity
arises due to exchange of virtual gravitons, in the same way as the
electromagnetic force arises from exchange of virtual photons.¹⁹ ²⁰ This
reproduces general relativity in the classical limit. However, this
approach fails at short distances of the order of the Planck length,¹⁸
where a more complete theory of quantum gravity (or a new approach to
quantum mechanics) is required.

Specifics

Earth's gravity

Main article: Earth's gravity

Every planetary body (including the Earth) is surrounded by its own
gravitational field, which exerts an attractive force on all objects.
Assuming a spherically symmetrical planet, the strength of this field at
any given point above the surface is proportional to the planetary body's
mass and inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the
center of the body.

The strength of the gravitational field is numerically equal to the
acceleration of objects under its influence. The rate of acceleration of
falling objects near the Earth's surface varies very slightly depending on
elevation, latitude, and other factors. For purposes of weights and
measures, a standard gravity value is defined by the International Bureau
of Weights and Measures, under the International System of Units (SI).

That value, denoted g, is g = 9.80665 m/s² (32.1740 ft/s²).²¹ ²²

The standard value of 9.80665 m/s² is the one originally adopted by the
International Committee on Weights and Measures in 1901 for 45° latitude,
even though it has been shown to be too high by about five parts in ten
thousand.²³ This value has persisted in meteorology and in some standard
atmospheres as the value for 45° latitude even though it applies more
precisely to latitude of 45°32'33".²⁴

Assuming the standardized value for g and ignoring air resistance, this
means that an object falling freely near the Earth's surface increases its
velocity by 9.80665 m/s (32.1740 ft/s or 22 mph) for each second of its
descent. Thus, an object starting from rest will attain a velocity of
9.80665 m/s (32.1740 ft/s) after one second, approximately 19.62 m/s (64.4
ft/s) after two seconds, and so on, adding 9.80665 m/s (32.1740 ft/s) to
each resulting velocity. Also, again ignoring air resistance, any and all
objects, when dropped from the same height, will hit the ground at the same
time. It is relevant to note that Earth's gravity doesn't have exactly the
same value in all regions. There are slight variations in different parts
of the globe due to latitude, surface features such as mountains and
ridges, and perhaps unusually high or low sub-surface densities.²⁵

According to Newton's 3rd Law, the Earth itself experiences a force equal
in magnitude and opposite in direction to that which it exerts on a falling
object. This means that the Earth also accelerates towards the object until
they collide. Because the mass of the Earth is huge, however, the
acceleration imparted to the Earth by this opposite force is negligible in
comparison to the object's. If the object doesn't bounce after it has
collided with the Earth, each of them then exerts a repulsive contact force
on the other which effectively balances the attractive force of gravity and
prevents further acceleration.

The force of gravity on Earth is the resultant (vector sum) of two forces:
(a) The gravitational attraction in accordance with Newton's universal law
of gravitation, and (b) the centrifugal force, which results from the
choice of an earthbound, rotating frame of reference. At the equator, the
force of gravity is the weakest due to the centrifugal force caused by the
Earth's rotation. The force of gravity varies with latitude and increases
from about 9.780 m/s² at the Equator to about 9.832 m/s² at the poles.

Equations for a falling body near the surface of the Earth

Main article: Equations for a falling body

Under an assumption of constant gravitational attraction, Newton's law of
universal gravitation simplifies to F = mg, where m is the mass of the body
and g is a constant vector with an average magnitude of 9.81 m/s² on Earth.
This resulting force is the object's weight. The acceleration due to
gravity is equal to this g. An initially stationary object which is allowed
to fall freely under gravity drops a distance which is proportional to the
square of the elapsed time. The image on the right, spanning half a second,
was captured with a stroboscopic flash at 20 flashes per second. During the
first ¹⁄₂₀ of a second the ball drops one unit of distance (here, a unit is
about 12 mm); by ²⁄₂₀ it has dropped at total of 4 units; by ³⁄₂₀, 9 units
and so on.

Under the same constant gravity assumptions, the potential energy, Eₚ, of a
body at height h is given by Eₚ = mgh (or Eₚ = Wh, with W meaning weight).
This expression is valid only over small distances h from the surface of
the Earth. Similarly, the expression h = \tfrac{v²}{2g} for the maximum
height reached by a vertically projected body with initial velocity v is
useful for small heights and small initial velocities only.

Gravity and astronomy

The application of Newton's law of gravity has enabled the acquisition of
much of the detailed information we have about the planets in our solar
system, the mass of the Sun, and details of quasars; even the existence of
dark matter is inferred using Newton's law of gravity. Although we have not
traveled to all the planets nor to the Sun, we know their masses. These
masses are obtained by applying the laws of gravity to the measured
characteristics of the orbit. In space an object maintains its orbit
because of the force of gravity acting upon it. Planets orbit stars, stars
orbit Galactic Centers, galaxies orbit a center of mass in clusters, and
clusters orbit in superclusters. The force of gravity exerted on one object
by another is directly proportional to the product of those objects' masses
and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.

Gravitational radiation

Main article: Gravitational wave

In general relativity, gravitational radiation is generated in situations
where the curvature of spacetime is oscillating, such as is the case with
co-orbiting objects. The gravitational radiation emitted by the Solar
System is far too small to measure. However, gravitational radiation has
been indirectly observed as an energy loss over time in binary pulsar
systems such as PSR B1913+16. It is believed that neutron star mergers and
black hole formation may create detectable amounts of gravitational
radiation. Gravitational radiation observatories such as the Laser
Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO) have been created to
study the problem. No confirmed detections have been made of this
hypothetical radiation.

Speed of gravity

Main article: Speed of gravity

In December 2012, a research team in China announced that it had produced
measurements of the phase lag of Earth tides during full and new moons
which seem to prove that the speed of gravity is equal to the speed of
light.²⁷ This means that if the Sun suddenly disappeared, the Earth would
keep orbiting it normally for 8 minutes, which is the time light takes to
travel that distance. The team's findings were released in the Chinese
Science Bulletin in February 2013.²⁸

Anomalies and discrepancies

There are some observations that are not adequately accounted for, which
may point to the need for better theories of gravity or perhaps be
explained in other ways.

- Extra-fast stars: Stars in galaxies follow a distribution of velocities
  where stars on the outskirts are moving faster than they should according
  to the observed distributions of normal matter. Galaxies within galaxy
  clusters show a similar pattern. Dark matter, which would interact
  gravitationally but not electromagnetically, would account for the
  discrepancy. Various modifications to Newtonian dynamics have also been
  proposed.
- Flyby anomaly: Various spacecraft have experienced greater acceleration
  than expected during gravity assist maneuvers.
- Accelerating expansion: The metric expansion of space seems to be
  speeding up. Dark energy has been proposed to explain this. A recent
  alternative explanation is that the geometry of space is not homogeneous
  (due to clusters of galaxies) and that when the data are reinterpreted to
  take this into account, the expansion is not speeding up after all,²⁹
  however this conclusion is disputed.³⁰
- Anomalous increase of the astronomical unit: Recent measurements indicate
  that planetary orbits are widening faster than if this were solely
  through the sun losing mass by radiating energy.
- Extra energetic photons: Photons travelling through galaxy clusters
  should gain energy and then lose it again on the way out. The
  accelerating expansion of the universe should stop the photons returning
  all the energy, but even taking this into account photons from the cosmic
  microwave background radiation gain twice as much energy as expected.
  This may indicate that gravity falls off faster than inverse-squared at
  certain distance scales.³¹
- Extra massive hydrogen clouds: The spectral lines of the Lyman-alpha
  forest suggest that hydrogen clouds are more clumped together at certain
  scales than expected and, like dark flow, may indicate that gravity falls
  off slower than inverse-squared at certain distance scales.³¹
- Power: Proposed extra dimensions could explain why the gravity force is
  so weak.³²

Helium

This article is about the chemical element. For other uses, see Helium
(disambiguation).

Helium is a chemical element with symbol He and atomic number 2. It is a
colorless, odorless, tasteless, non-toxic, inert, monatomic gas that heads
the noble gas group in the periodic table. Its boiling and melting points
are the lowest among all the elements.

Helium is the second lightest element and is the second most abundant
element in the observable universe, being present at about 24% of the total
elemental mass, which is more than 12 times the mass of all the heavier
elements combined. Its abundance is similar to this figure in the Sun and
in Jupiter. This is due to the very high nuclear binding energy (per
nucleon) of helium-4 with respect to the next three elements after helium.
This helium-4 binding energy also accounts for why it is a product of both
nuclear fusion and radioactive decay. Most helium in the universe is
helium-4, and is believed to have been formed during the Big Bang. Large
amounts of new helium are being created by nuclear fusion of hydrogen in
stars.

Helium is named for the Greek god of the Sun, Helios. It was first detected
as an unknown yellow spectral line signature in sunlight during a solar
eclipse in 1868 by French astronomer Jules Janssen. Janssen is jointly
credited with detecting the element along with Norman Lockyer. Jannsen
observed during the solar eclipse of 1868 while Lockyer observed from
Britain. Lockyer was the first to propose that the line was due to a new
element, which he named. The formal discovery of the element was made in
1895 by two Swedish chemists, Per Teodor Cleve and Nils Abraham Langlet,
who found helium emanating from the uranium ore cleveite. In 1903, large
reserves of helium were found in natural gas fields in parts of the United
States, which is by far the largest supplier of the gas today.

Liquid helium is used in cryogenics (its largest single use, absorbing
about a quarter of production), particularly in the cooling of
superconducting magnets, with the main commercial application being in MRI
scanners. Helium's other industrial uses—as a pressurizing and purge gas,
as a protective atmosphere for arc welding and in processes such as growing
crystals to make silicon wafers—account for half of the gas produced. A
well-known but minor use is as a lifting gas in balloons and airships.⁴ As
with any gas whose density differs from that of air, inhaling a small
volume of helium temporarily changes the timbre and quality of the human
voice. In scientific research, the behavior of the two fluid phases of
helium-4 (helium I and helium II) is important to researchers studying
quantum mechanics (in particular the property of superfluidity) and to
those looking at the phenomena, such as superconductivity, produced in
matter near absolute zero.

On Earth it is relatively rare — 5.2 ppm by volume in the atmosphere. Most
terrestrial helium present today is created by the natural radioactive
decay of heavy radioactive elements (thorium and uranium, although there
are other examples), as the alpha particles emitted by such decays consist
of helium-4 nuclei. This radiogenic helium is trapped with natural gas in
concentrations up to 7% by volume, from which it is extracted commercially
by a low-temperature separation process called fractional distillation.
Helium is a finite resource, and once released into the atmosphere, it
readily escapes into space.⁵ ⁶ ⁷

History

Scientific discoveries

The first evidence of helium was observed on August 18, 1868 as a bright
yellow line with a wavelength of 587.49 nanometers in the spectrum of the
chromosphere of the Sun. The line was detected by French astronomer Jules
Janssen during a total solar eclipse in Guntur, India.⁸ ⁹ This line was
initially assumed to be sodium. On October 20 of the same year, English
astronomer Norman Lockyer observed a yellow line in the solar spectrum,
which he named the D₃ Fraunhofer line because it was near the known D₁ and
D₂ lines of sodium.¹⁰ He concluded that it was caused by an element in the
Sun unknown on Earth. Lockyer and English chemist Edward Frankland named
the element with the Greek word for the Sun, ἥλιος (helios).¹¹ ¹²

In 1882, Italian physicist Luigi Palmieri detected helium on Earth, for the
first time, through its D₃ spectral line, when he analyzed the lava of
Mount Vesuvius.¹³

On March 26, 1895, Scottish chemist Sir William Ramsay isolated helium on
Earth by treating the mineral cleveite (a variety of uraninite with at
least 10% rare earth elements) with mineral acids. Ramsay was looking for
argon but, after separating nitrogen and oxygen from the gas liberated by
sulfuric acid, he noticed a bright yellow line that matched the D₃ line
observed in the spectrum of the Sun.¹⁰ ¹⁴ ¹⁵ ¹⁶ These samples were
identified as helium by Lockyer and British physicist William Crookes. It
was independently isolated from cleveite in the same year by chemists Per
Teodor Cleve and Abraham Langlet in Uppsala, Sweden, who collected enough
of the gas to accurately determine its atomic weight.⁹ ¹⁷ ¹⁸ Helium was
also isolated by the American geochemist William Francis Hillebrand prior
to Ramsay's discovery when he noticed unusual spectral lines while testing
a sample of the mineral uraninite. Hillebrand, however, attributed the
lines to nitrogen. His letter of congratulations to Ramsay offers an
interesting case of discovery and near-discovery in science.¹⁹

In 1907, Ernest Rutherford and Thomas Royds demonstrated that alpha
particles are helium nuclei by allowing the particles to penetrate the thin
glass wall of an evacuated tube, then creating a discharge in the tube to
study the spectra of the new gas inside. In 1908, helium was first
liquefied by Dutch physicist Heike Kamerlingh Onnes by cooling the gas to
less than one kelvin.²⁰ He tried to solidify it by further reducing the
temperature but failed because helium does not solidify at atmospheric
pressure. Onnes' student Willem Hendrik Keesom was eventually able to
solidify 1 cm³ of helium in 1926 by applying additional external
pressure.²¹

In 1938, Russian physicist Pyotr Leonidovich Kapitsa discovered that
helium-4 has almost no viscosity at temperatures near absolute zero, a
phenomenon now called superfluidity.²² This phenomenon is related to
Bose–Einstein condensation. In 1972, the same phenomenon was observed in
helium-3, but at temperatures much closer to absolute zero, by American
physicists Douglas D. Osheroff, David M. Lee, and Robert C. Richardson. The
phenomenon in helium-3 is thought to be related to pairing of helium-3
fermions to make bosons, in analogy to Cooper pairs of electrons producing
superconductivity.²³

Extraction and use

After an oil drilling operation in 1903 in Dexter, Kansas produced a gas
geyser that would not burn, Kansas state geologist Erasmus Haworth
collected samples of the escaping gas and took them back to the University
of Kansas at Lawrence where, with the help of chemists Hamilton Cady and
David McFarland, he discovered that the gas consisted of, by volume, 72%
nitrogen, 15% methane (a combustible percentage only with sufficient
oxygen), 1% hydrogen, and 12% an unidentifiable gas.⁹ ²⁴ With further
analysis, Cady and McFarland discovered that 1.84% of the gas sample was
helium.²⁵ ²⁶ This showed that despite its overall rarity on Earth, helium
was concentrated in large quantities under the American Great Plains,
available for extraction as a byproduct of natural gas.²⁷

This enabled the United States to become the world's leading supplier of
helium. Following a suggestion by Sir Richard Threlfall, the United States
Navy sponsored three small experimental helium plants during World War I.
The goal was to supply barrage balloons with the non-flammable,
lighter-than-air gas. A total of 5,700 m³ (200,000 cu ft) of 92% helium was
produced in the program even though less than a cubic meter of the gas had
previously been obtained.¹⁰ Some of this gas was used in the world's first
helium-filled airship, the U.S. Navy's C-7, which flew its maiden voyage
from Hampton Roads, Virginia, to Bolling Field in Washington, D.C., on
December 1, 1921,²⁸ nearly two years before the Navy's first rigid airship
to be helium-filled, the Naval Aircraft Factory-built USS Shenandoah,
itself flew for the first time in September 1923.

Although the extraction process, using low-temperature gas liquefaction,
was not developed in time to be significant during World War I, production
continued. Helium was primarily used as a lifting gas in lighter-than-air
craft. This use increased demand during World War II, as well as demands
for shielded arc welding. The helium mass spectrometer was also vital in
the atomic bomb Manhattan Project.²⁹

The government of the United States set up the National Helium Reserve in
1925 at Amarillo, Texas, with the goal of supplying military airships in
time of war and commercial airships in peacetime.¹⁰ Because of the Helium
Control Act (1927), which banned the export of scarce helium on which the
US then had a production monopoly, together with the prohibitive cost of
the gas, the Hindenburg, like all German Zeppelins, was forced to use
hydrogen as the lift gas. Helium use following World War II was depressed
but the reserve was expanded in the 1950s to ensure a supply of liquid
helium as a coolant to create oxygen/hydrogen rocket fuel (among other
uses) during the Space Race and Cold War. Helium use in the United States
in 1965 was more than eight times the peak wartime consumption.³⁰

After the "Helium Acts Amendments of 1960" (Public Law 86–777), the U.S.
Bureau of Mines arranged for five private plants to recover helium from
natural gas. For this helium conservation program, the Bureau built a
425-mile (684 km) pipeline from Bushton, Kansas, to connect those plants
with the government's partially depleted Cliffside gas field, near
Amarillo, Texas. This helium-nitrogen mixture was injected and stored in
the Cliffside gas field until needed, when it then was further purified.³¹

By 1995, a billion cubic meters of the gas had been collected and the
reserve was US$1.4 billion in debt, prompting the Congress of the United
States in 1996 to phase out the reserve.⁹ ³² The resulting "Helium
Privatization Act of 1996"³³ (Public Law 104–273) directed the United
States Department of the Interior to empty the reserve, with sales starting
by 2005.³⁴

Helium produced between 1930 and 1945 was about 98.3% pure (2% nitrogen),
which was adequate for airships. In 1945, a small amount of 99.9% helium
was produced for welding use. By 1949, commercial quantities of Grade A
99.95% helium were available.³⁵

For many years the United States produced over 90% of commercially usable
helium in the world, while extraction plants in Canada, Poland, Russia, and
other nations produced the remainder. In the mid-1990s, a new plant in
Arzew, Algeria, producing 17 million cubic meters (600 million cubic feet)
began operation, with enough production to cover all of Europe's demand.
Meanwhile, by 2000, the consumption of helium within the U.S. had risen to
above 15 million kg per year.³⁶ In 2004–2006, two additional plants, one in
Ras Laffan, Qatar, and the other in Skikda, Algeria, were built. Algeria
quickly became the second leading producer of helium.³⁷ Through this time,
both helium consumption and the costs of producing helium increased.³⁸ From
2002 to 2007 helium prices doubled.³⁹

As of 2012 the United States National Helium Reserve accounted for 30
percent of the world's helium.⁴⁰ The reserve was expected to run out of
helium in 2018.⁴⁰ Despite that a proposed bill in the United States Senate
would allow the reserve to continue to sell the gas. Other large reserves
were in the Hugoton in Kansas, United States and nearby gas fields of
Kansas and the panhandles of Texas and Oklahoma. New helium plants were
scheduled to open in 2012 in Qatar, Russia and the United States state of
Wyoming but they were not expected to ease the shortage.⁴⁰

In 2013, Qatar started up the world's largest helium unit.⁴¹ 2014 was
widely acknowledged to be a year of over-supply in the helium business,
following years of renowned shortages.⁴² Nasdaq reported (2015) that for
Air Products, an international corporation that sells gases for industrial
use, helium volumes remain under pressure due to feedstock supply
constraints.⁴³

Characteristics

The helium atom

Main article: Helium atom

Helium in quantum mechanics

In the perspective of quantum mechanics, helium is the second simplest atom
to model, following the hydrogen atom. Helium is composed of two electrons
in atomic orbitals surrounding a nucleus containing two protons along with
some neutrons. As in Newtonian mechanics, no system consisting of more than
two particles can be solved with an exact analytical mathematical approach
(see 3-body problem) and helium is no exception. Thus, numerical
mathematical methods are required, even to solve the system of one nucleus
and two electrons. Such computational chemistry methods have been used to
create a quantum mechanical picture of helium electron binding which is
accurate to within < 2% of the correct value, in a few computational
steps.⁴⁴ In such models it is found that each electron in helium partly
screens the nucleus from the other, so that the effective nuclear charge Z
which each electron sees, is about 1.69 units, not the 2 charges of a
classic "bare" helium nucleus.

The related stability of the helium-4 nucleus and electron shell

The nucleus of the helium-4 atom is identical with an alpha particle.
High-energy electron-scattering experiments show its charge to decrease
exponentially from a maximum at a central point, exactly as does the charge
density of helium's own electron cloud. This symmetry reflects similar
underlying physics: the pair of neutrons and the pair of protons in
helium's nucleus obey the same quantum mechanical rules as do helium's pair
of electrons (although the nuclear particles are subject to a different
nuclear binding potential), so that all these fermions fully occupy 1s
orbitals in pairs, none of them possessing orbital angular momentum, and
each cancelling the other's intrinsic spin. Adding another of any of these
particles would require angular momentum and would release substantially
less energy (in fact, no nucleus with five nucleons is stable). This
arrangement is thus energetically extremely stable for all these particles,
and this stability accounts for many crucial facts regarding helium in
nature.

For example, the stability and low energy of the electron cloud state in
helium accounts for the element's chemical inertness, and also the lack of
interaction of helium atoms with each other, producing the lowest melting
and boiling points of all the elements.

In a similar way, the particular energetic stability of the helium-4
nucleus, produced by similar effects, accounts for the ease of helium-4
production in atomic reactions involving both heavy-particle emission, and
fusion. Some stable helium-3 is produced in fusion reactions from hydrogen,
but it is a very small fraction, compared with the highly favorable
helium-4.

The unusual stability of the helium-4 nucleus is also important
cosmologically: it explains the fact that in the first few minutes after
the Big Bang, as the "soup" of free protons and neutrons which had
initially been created in about 6:1 ratio cooled to the point that nuclear
binding was possible, almost all first compound atomic nuclei to form were
helium-4 nuclei. So tight was helium-4 binding that helium-4 production
consumed nearly all of the free neutrons in a few minutes, before they
could beta-decay, and also leaving few to form heavier atoms such as
lithium, beryllium, or boron. Helium-4 nuclear binding per nucleon is
stronger than in any of these elements (see nucleogenesis and binding
energy) and thus no energetic drive was available, once helium had been
formed, to make elements 3, 4 and 5. It was barely energetically favorable
for helium to fuse into the next element with a lower energy per nucleon,
carbon. However, due to lack of intermediate elements, this process
requires three helium nuclei striking each other nearly simultaneously (see
triple alpha process). There was thus no time for significant carbon to be
formed in the few minutes after the Big Bang, before the early expanding
universe cooled to the temperature and pressure point where helium fusion
to carbon was no longer possible. This left the early universe with a very
similar ratio of hydrogen/helium as is observed today (3 parts hydrogen to
1 part helium-4 by mass), with nearly all the neutrons in the universe
trapped in helium-4.

All heavier elements (including those necessary for rocky planets like the
Earth, and for carbon-based or other life) have thus been created since the
Big Bang in stars which were hot enough to fuse helium itself. All elements
other than hydrogen and helium today account for only 2% of the mass of
atomic matter in the universe. Helium-4, by contrast, makes up about 23% of
the universe's ordinary matter—nearly all the ordinary matter that is not
hydrogen.

Gas and plasma phases

Helium is the second least reactive noble gas, after neon, and thus the
second least reactive of all elements.⁴⁵ It is inert and monatomic in all
standard conditions. Because of helium's relatively low molar (atomic)
mass, its thermal conductivity, specific heat, and sound speed in the gas
phase are all greater than any other gas except hydrogen. For similar
reasons, and also due to the small size of helium atoms, helium's diffusion
rate through solids is three times that of air and around 65% that of
hydrogen.¹⁰

Helium is the least water-soluble monatomic gas,⁴⁶ and one of the least
water-soluble of any gas (CF₄, SF₆, and C₄F₈ have lower mole fraction
solubilities: 0.3802, 0.4394, and 0.2372 x₂/10−5, respectively, versus
helium's 0.70797 x₂/10−5),⁴⁷ and helium's index of refraction is closer to
unity than that of any other gas.⁴⁸ Helium has a negative Joule-Thomson
coefficient at normal ambient temperatures, meaning it heats up when
allowed to freely expand. Only below its Joule-Thomson inversion
temperature (of about 32 to 50 K at 1 atmosphere) does it cool upon free
expansion.¹⁰ Once precooled below this temperature, helium can be liquefied
through expansion cooling.

Most extraterrestrial helium is found in a plasma state, with properties
quite different from those of atomic helium. In a plasma, helium's
electrons are not bound to its nucleus, resulting in very high electrical
conductivity, even when the gas is only partially ionized. The charged
particles are highly influenced by magnetic and electric fields. For
example, in the solar wind together with ionized hydrogen, the particles
interact with the Earth's magnetosphere giving rise to Birkeland currents
and the aurora.⁴⁹

Liquid helium

Main article: Liquid helium

Unlike any other element, helium will remain liquid down to absolute zero
at normal pressures. This is a direct effect of quantum mechanics:
specifically, the zero point energy of the system is too high to allow
freezing. Solid helium requires a temperature of 1–1.5 K (about −272 °C or
−457 °F) and about 25 bar (2.5 MPa) of pressure.⁵⁰ It is often hard to
distinguish solid from liquid helium since the refractive index of the two
phases are nearly the same. The solid has a sharp melting point and has a
crystalline structure, but it is highly compressible; applying pressure in
a laboratory can decrease its volume by more than 30%.⁵¹ With a bulk
modulus of about 27 MPa⁵² it is ~100 times more compressible than water.
Solid helium has a density of 0.214 ± 0.006 g/cm³ at 1.15 K and 66 atm; the
projected density at 0 K and 25 bar (2.5 MPa) is 0.187 ± 0.009 g/cm³.⁵³

Helium I state

Below its boiling point of 4.22 kelvins and above the lambda point of
2.1768 kelvins, the isotope helium-4 exists in a normal colorless liquid
state, called helium I.¹⁰ Like other cryogenic liquids, helium I boils when
it is heated and contracts when its temperature is lowered. Below the
lambda point, however, helium does not boil, and it expands as the
temperature is lowered further.

Helium I has a gas-like index of refraction of 1.026 which makes its
surface so hard to see that floats of styrofoam are often used to show
where the surface is.¹⁰ This colorless liquid has a very low viscosity and
a density of 0.145–0.125 g/mL (between about 0 and 4 K),⁵⁴ which is only
one-fourth the value expected from classical physics.¹⁰ Quantum mechanics
is needed to explain this property and thus both types of liquid helium are
called quantum fluids, meaning they display atomic properties on a
macroscopic scale. This may be an effect of its boiling point being so
close to absolute zero, preventing random molecular motion (thermal energy)
from masking the atomic properties.¹⁰

Helium II state

Main article: Superfluid helium-4

Liquid helium below its lambda point begins to exhibit very unusual
characteristics, in a state called helium II. When helium II boils, due to
its high thermal conductivity it does not bubble but rather evaporates
directly from its surface. Helium-3 also has a superfluid phase, but only
at much lower temperatures; as a result, less is known about such
properties in the isotope.¹⁰

Helium II is a superfluid, a quantum mechanical state (see: macroscopic
quantum phenomena) of matter with strange properties. For example, when it
flows through capillaries as thin as 10−7 to 10−8 m it has no measurable
viscosity.⁹ However, when measurements were done between two moving discs,
a viscosity comparable to that of gaseous helium was observed. Current
theory explains this using the two-fluid model for helium II. In this
model, liquid helium below the lambda point is viewed as containing a
proportion of helium atoms in a ground state, which are superfluid and flow
with exactly zero viscosity, and a proportion of helium atoms in an excited
state, which behave more like an ordinary fluid.⁵⁵

In the fountain effect, a chamber is constructed which is connected to a
reservoir of helium II by a sintered disc through which superfluid helium
leaks easily but through which non-superfluid helium cannot pass. If the
interior of the container is heated, the superfluid helium changes to
non-superfluid helium. In order to maintain the equilibrium fraction of
superfluid helium, superfluid helium leaks through and increases the
pressure, causing liquid to fountain out of the container.⁵⁶

The thermal conductivity of helium II is greater than that of any other
known substance, a million times that of helium I and several hundred times
that of copper.¹⁰ This is because heat conduction occurs by an exceptional
quantum mechanism. Most materials that conduct heat well have a valence
band of free electrons which serve to transfer the heat. Helium II has no
such valence band but nevertheless conducts heat well. The flow of heat is
governed by equations that are similar to the wave equation used to
characterize sound propagation in air. When heat is introduced, it moves at
20 meters per second at 1.8 K through helium II as waves in a phenomenon
known as second sound.¹⁰

Helium II also exhibits a creeping effect. When a surface extends past the
level of helium II, the helium II moves along the surface, against the
force of gravity. Helium II will escape from a vessel that is not sealed by
creeping along the sides until it reaches a warmer region where it
evaporates. It moves in a 30 nm-thick film regardless of surface material.
This film is called a Rollin film and is named after the man who first
characterized this trait, Bernard V. Rollin.¹⁰ ⁵⁷ ⁵⁸ As a result of this
creeping behavior and helium II's ability to leak rapidly through tiny
openings, it is very difficult to confine liquid helium. Unless the
container is carefully constructed, the helium II will creep along the
surfaces and through valves until it reaches somewhere warmer, where it
will evaporate. Waves propagating across a Rollin film are governed by the
same equation as gravity waves in shallow water, but rather than gravity,
the restoring force is the van der Waals force.⁵⁹ These waves are known as
third sound.⁶⁰

Isotopes

Main article: Isotopes of helium

There are nine known isotopes of helium, but only helium-3 and helium-4 are
stable. In the Earth's atmosphere, there is one 3
He atom for every million 4
He atoms.⁹ Unlike most elements, helium's isotopic abundance varies greatly
by origin, due to the different formation processes. The most common
isotope, helium-4, is produced on Earth by alpha decay of heavier
radioactive elements; the alpha particles that emerge are fully ionized
helium-4 nuclei. Helium-4 is an unusually stable nucleus because its
nucleons are arranged into complete shells. It was also formed in enormous
quantities during Big Bang nucleosynthesis.⁶¹

Helium-3 is present on Earth only in trace amounts; most of it since
Earth's formation, though some falls to Earth trapped in cosmic dust.⁶²
Trace amounts are also produced by the beta decay of tritium.⁶³ Rocks from
the Earth's crust have isotope ratios varying by as much as a factor of
ten, and these ratios can be used to investigate the origin of rocks and
the composition of the Earth's mantle.⁶² 3
He is much more abundant in stars, as a product of nuclear fusion. Thus in
the interstellar medium, the proportion of 3
He to 4
He is around 100 times higher than on Earth.⁶⁴ Extraplanetary material,
such as lunar and asteroid regolith, have trace amounts of helium-3 from
being bombarded by solar winds. The Moon's surface contains helium-3 at
concentrations on the order of 10 ppb, much higher than the approximately 5
ppt found in the Earth's atmosphere.⁶⁵ ⁶⁶ A number of people, starting with
Gerald Kulcinski in 1986,⁶⁷ have proposed to explore the moon, mine lunar
regolith and use the helium-3 for fusion.

Liquid helium-4 can be cooled to about 1 kelvin using evaporative cooling
in a 1-K pot. Similar cooling of helium-3, which has a lower boiling point,
can achieve about 0.2 kelvin in a helium-3 refrigerator. Equal mixtures of
liquid 3
He and 4
He below 0.8 K separate into two immiscible phases due to their
dissimilarity (they follow different quantum statistics: helium-4 atoms are
bosons while helium-3 atoms are fermions).¹⁰ Dilution refrigerators use
this immiscibility to achieve temperatures of a few millikelvins.

It is possible to produce exotic helium isotopes, which rapidly decay into
other substances. The shortest-lived heavy helium isotope is helium-5 with
a half-life of 7.6×10−22 s. Helium-6 decays by emitting a beta particle and
has a half-life of 0.8 second. Helium-7 also emits a beta particle as well
as a gamma ray. Helium-7 and helium-8 are created in certain nuclear
reactions.¹⁰ Helium-6 and helium-8 are known to exhibit a nuclear halo.¹⁰

Compounds

See also: Noble gas compound

Helium has a valence of zero and is chemically unreactive under all normal
conditions.⁵¹ It is an electrical insulator unless ionized. As with the
other noble gases, helium has metastable energy levels that allow it to
remain ionized in an electrical discharge with a voltage below its
ionization potential.¹⁰ Helium can form unstable compounds, known as
excimers, with tungsten, iodine, fluorine, sulfur and phosphorus when it is
subjected to a glow discharge, to electron bombardment, or else is a plasma
for another reason. The molecular compounds HeNe, HgHe₁₀, and WHe₂, and the
molecular ions He+
2, He2+
2, HeH+
, and HeD+
have been created this way.⁶⁸ HeH⁺ is also stable in its ground state, but
is extremely reactive—it is the strongest Brønsted acid known, and
therefore can exist only in isolation, as it will protonate any molecule or
counteranion it comes into contact with. This technique has also allowed
the production of the neutral molecule He₂, which has a large number of
band systems, and HgHe, which is apparently held together only by
polarization forces.¹⁰

Van der Waals compounds of helium can also be formed with cryogenic helium
gas and atoms of a substance, such as LiHe and He₂.⁶⁹

Theoretically, other true compounds may also be possible, such as helium
fluorohydride (HHeF) which would be analogous to HArF, discovered in
2000.⁷⁰ Calculations show that two new compounds containing a helium-oxygen
bond could be stable.⁷¹ Two new molecular species, predicted using theory,
CsFHeO and N(CH₃)₄FHeO, are derivatives of a metastable [F– HeO] anion
first theorized in 2005 by a group from Taiwan. If confirmed by experiment,
the only remaining element with no known stable compounds would be neon.⁷²

Helium has been put inside the hollow carbon cage molecules (the
fullerenes) by heating under high pressure. The endohedral fullerene
molecules formed are stable up to high temperatures. When chemical
derivatives of these fullerenes are formed, the helium stays inside.⁷³ If
helium-3 is used, it can be readily observed by helium nuclear magnetic
resonance spectroscopy.⁷⁴ Many fullerenes containing helium-3 have been
reported. Although the helium atoms are not attached by covalent or ionic
bonds, these substances have distinct properties and a definite
composition, like all stoichiometric chemical compounds.

Under extremely high pressures helium can react with many elements. At 130
GPa Na₂He is thermodynamically stable with a fluorite structure.⁷⁵

Occurrence and production

Natural abundance

Although it is rare on Earth, helium is the second most abundant element in
the known Universe (after hydrogen), constituting 23% of its baryonic
mass.⁹ The vast majority of helium was formed by Big Bang nucleosynthesis
one to three minutes after the Big Bang. As such, measurements of its
abundance contribute to cosmological models. In stars, it is formed by the
nuclear fusion of hydrogen in proton-proton chain reactions and the CNO
cycle, part of stellar nucleosynthesis.⁶¹

In the Earth's atmosphere, the concentration of helium by volume is only
5.2 parts per million.⁷⁶ ⁷⁷ The concentration is low and fairly constant
despite the continuous production of new helium because most helium in the
Earth's atmosphere escapes into space by several processes.⁷⁸ ⁷⁹ ⁸⁰ In the
Earth's heterosphere, a part of the upper atmosphere, helium and other
lighter gases are the most abundant elements.

Most helium on Earth is a result of radioactive decay. Helium is found in
large amounts in minerals of uranium and thorium, including cleveite,
pitchblende, carnotite and monazite, because they emit alpha particles
(helium nuclei, He²⁺) to which electrons immediately combine as soon as the
particle is stopped by the rock. In this way an estimated 3000 metric tons
of helium are generated per year throughout the lithosphere.⁸¹ ⁸² ⁸³ In the
Earth's crust, the concentration of helium is 8 parts per billion. In
seawater, the concentration is only 4 parts per trillion. There are also
small amounts in mineral springs, volcanic gas, and meteoric iron. Because
helium is trapped in the subsurface under conditions that also trap natural
gas, the greatest natural concentrations of helium on the planet are found
in natural gas, from which most commercial helium is extracted. The
concentration varies in a broad range from a few ppm up to over 7% in a
small gas field in San Juan County, New Mexico.⁸⁴ ⁸⁵

As of 2011 the world's helium reserves were estimated at 40 billion cubic
meters, with a quarter of that being in the South Pars / North Dome
Gas-Condensate field owned jointly by Qatar and Iran.⁸⁶

Modern extraction and distribution

For large-scale use, helium is extracted by fractional distillation from
natural gas, which can contain up to 7% helium.⁸⁷ Since helium has a lower
boiling point than any other element, low temperature and high pressure are
used to liquefy nearly all the other gases (mostly nitrogen and methane).
The resulting crude helium gas is purified by successive exposures to
lowering temperatures, in which almost all of the remaining nitrogen and
other gases are precipitated out of the gaseous mixture. Activated charcoal
is used as a final purification step, usually resulting in 99.995% pure
Grade-A helium.¹⁰ The principal impurity in Grade-A helium is neon. In a
final production step, most of the helium that is produced is liquefied via
a cryogenic process. This is necessary for applications requiring liquid
helium and also allows helium suppliers to reduce the cost of long distance
transportation, as the largest liquid helium containers have more than five
times the capacity of the largest gaseous helium tube trailers.³⁷ ⁸⁸

In 2008, approximately 169 million standard cubic meters (SCM) of helium
were extracted from natural gas or withdrawn from helium reserves with
approximately 78% from the United States, 10% from Algeria, and most of the
remainder from Russia, Poland and Qatar.⁸⁹ By 2013, increases in helium
production in Qatar (under the company RasGas managed by Air Liquide) had
increased Qatar's fraction of world helium production to 25%, and made it
the second largest exporter after the United States. Demand for helium
rises at about 5% to 6% per year. ⁹⁰

In the United States, most helium is extracted from natural gas of the
Hugoton and nearby gas fields in Kansas, Oklahoma, and the Panhandle Field
in Texas.³⁷ ⁹¹ Much of this gas was once sent by pipeline to the National
Helium Reserve, but since 2005 this reserve is being depleted and sold off,
and is expected under present law to be largely depleted by 2021.⁹²

Diffusion of crude natural gas through special semipermeable membranes and
other barriers is another method to recover and purify helium.⁹³ In 1996,
the U.S. had proven helium reserves, in such gas well complexes, of about
147 billion standard cubic feet (4.2 billion SCM).⁹⁴ At rates of use at
that time (72 million SCM per year in the U.S.; see pie chart below) this
is enough helium for about 58 years of U.S. use, and less than this
(perhaps 80% of the time) at world use rates, although factors in saving
and processing impact effective reserve numbers.

Helium must be extracted from natural gas because it is present in air at
only a fraction of that of neon, yet the demand for it is far higher. It is
estimated that if all neon production were retooled to save helium, that
0.1% of the world's helium demands would be satisfied. Similarly, only 1%
of the world's helium demands could be satisfied by re-tooling all air
distillation plants.⁹⁵ Helium can be synthesized by bombardment of lithium
or boron with high-velocity protons, but this process is a completely
uneconomic method of production.⁹⁶

Helium is commercially available in either liquid or gaseous form. As a
liquid, it can be supplied in small insulated containers called dewars
which hold up to 1,000 liters of helium, or in large ISO containers which
have nominal capacities as large as 42 m³ (around 11,000 U.S. gallons). In
gaseous form, small quantities of helium are supplied in high-pressure
cylinders holding up to 8 m³ (approx. 282 standard cubic feet), while large
quantities of high-pressure gas are supplied in tube trailers which have
capacities of up to 4,860 m³ (approx. 172,000 standard cubic feet).

Conservation advocates

According to helium conservationists like Nobel laureate physicist Robert
Coleman Richardson, the free market price of helium has contributed to
"wasteful" usage (e.g. for helium balloons). Prices in the 2000s have been
lowered by U.S. Congress' decision to sell off the country's large helium
stockpile by 2015.⁹⁷ According to Richardson, the current price needs to be
multiplied by 20 to eliminate the excessive wasting of helium. In their
book, the Future of helium as a natural resource (Routledge, 2012),
Nuttall, Clarke & Glowacki (2012) also proposed to create an International
Helium Agency (IHA) to build a sustainable market for this precious
commodity.⁹⁸

Applications

Estimated 2013 U.S. fractional helium use by category. Total use is 47
million cubic meters.⁹⁹

Cryogenics (32%)
Pressurizing and purging (18%)
Welding (13%)
Controlled atmospheres (18%)
Leak detection (4%)
Breathing mixtures (2%)
Other (13%)

While balloons are perhaps the best known use of helium, they are a minor
part of all helium use.³² Helium is used for many purposes that require
some of its unique properties, such as its low boiling point, low density,
low solubility, high thermal conductivity, or inertness. Of the 2008 world
helium total production of about 32 million kg (193 million standard cubic
meters) helium per year, the largest use (about 22% of the total in 2008)
is in cryogenic applications, most of which involves cooling the
superconducting magnets in medical MRI scanners.¹⁰⁰ Other major uses
(totalling to about 60% of use in 1996) were pressurizing and purging
systems, maintenance of controlled atmospheres, welding, and leak
detection. Other uses by category were relatively minor fractions.¹⁰¹

Controlled atmospheres

Helium is used as a protective gas in growing silicon and germanium
crystals, in titanium and zirconium production, and in gas
chromatography,⁵¹ because it is inert. Because of its inertness, thermally
and calorically perfect nature, high speed of sound, and high value of the
heat capacity ratio, it is also useful in supersonic wind tunnels¹⁰² and
impulse facilities.¹⁰³

Gas tungsten arc welding

Main article: gas tungsten arc welding

Helium is used as a shielding gas in arc welding processes on materials
that at welding temperatures are contaminated and weakened by air or
nitrogen.⁹ A number of inert shielding gases are used in gas tungsten arc
welding, but helium is used instead of cheaper argon especially for welding
materials that have higher heat conductivity, like aluminium or copper.

Minor uses

Industrial leak detection

One industrial application for helium is leak detection. Because helium
diffuses through solids three times faster than air, it is used as a tracer
gas to detect leaks in high-vacuum equipment (such as cryogenic tanks) and
high-pressure containers.¹⁰⁴ The tested object is placed in a chamber,
which is then evacuated and filled with helium. The helium that escapes
through the leaks is detected by a sensitive device (helium mass
spectrometer), even at the leak rates as small as 10−9 mbar·L/s (10−10
Pa·m³/s). The measurement procedure is normally automatic and is called
helium integral test. A simpler procedure is to fill the tested object with
helium and to manually search for leaks with a hand-held device.¹⁰⁵

Helium leaks through cracks should not be confused with gas permeation
through a bulk material. While helium has documented permeation constants
(thus a calculable permeation rate) through glasses, ceramics, and
synthetic materials, inert gases such as helium will not permeate most bulk
metals.¹⁰⁶

Flight

Because it is lighter than air, airships and balloons are inflated with
helium for lift. While hydrogen gas is also buoyant, helium has the
advantage of being non-flammable (in addition to being fire retardant).
Another minor use is in rocketry, where helium is used as an ullage medium
to displace fuel and oxidizers in storage tanks and to condense hydrogen
and oxygen to make rocket fuel. It is also used to purge fuel and oxidizer
from ground support equipment prior to launch and to pre-cool liquid
hydrogen in space vehicles. For example, the Saturn V rocket used in the
Apollo program needed about 370,000 m³ (13 million cubic feet) of helium to
launch.⁵¹

Minor commercial and recreational uses

Helium as a breathing gas has no narcotic properties, so helium mixtures
such as trimix, heliox and heliair are used for deep diving to reduce the
effects of narcosis.¹⁰⁷ ¹⁰⁸ At depths below 150 metres (490 ft) divers
breathing helium–oxygen mixtures begin to experience tremors and a decrease
in psychomotor function, symptoms of high-pressure nervous syndrome.¹⁰⁹
This effect may be countered to some extent by adding an amount of narcotic
gas such as hydrogen or nitrogen to a helium–oxygen mixture.¹¹⁰ At these
depths the low density of helium is found to considerably reduce the effort
of breathing.¹¹¹

Helium–neon lasers, a type of low-powered gas laser producing a red beam,
had various practical applications which included barcode readers and laser
pointers, before they were almost universally replaced by cheaper diode
lasers.⁹

For its inertness and high thermal conductivity, neutron transparency, and
because it does not form radioactive isotopes under reactor conditions,
helium is used as a heat-transfer medium in some gas-cooled nuclear
reactors.¹⁰⁴

Helium, mixed with a heavier gas such as xenon, is useful for
thermoacoustic refrigeration due to the resulting high heat capacity ratio
and low Prandtl number.¹¹² The inertness of helium has environmental
advantages over conventional refrigeration systems which contribute to
ozone depletion or global warming.¹¹³

Helium is also used in some hard disk drives.¹¹⁴

Scientific uses

The use of helium reduces the distorting effects of temperature variations
in the space between lenses in some telescopes, due to its extremely low
index of refraction.¹⁰ This method is especially used in solar telescopes
where a vacuum tight telescope tube would be too heavy.¹¹⁵ ¹¹⁶

Helium is a commonly used carrier gas for gas chromatography.

The age of rocks and minerals that contain uranium and thorium can be
estimated by measuring the level of helium with a process known as helium
dating.⁹ ¹⁰

Helium at low temperatures is used in cryogenics, and in certain cryogenics
applications. As examples of applications, liquid helium is used to cool
certain metals to the extremely low temperatures required for
superconductivity, such as in superconducting magnets for magnetic
resonance imaging. The Large Hadron Collider at CERN uses 96 metric tons of
liquid helium to maintain the temperature at 1.9 kelvin.¹¹⁷

Inhalation and safety

Effects

Neutral helium at standard conditions is non-toxic, plays no biological
role and is found in trace amounts in human blood.

The speed of sound in helium is nearly three times the speed of sound in
air. Because the fundamental frequency of a gas-filled cavity is
proportional to the speed of sound in the gas, when helium is inhaled there
is a corresponding increase in the resonant frequencies of the vocal
tract.⁹ ¹¹⁸ The fundamental frequency (sometimes called pitch) does not
change, since this is produced by direct vibration of the vocal folds,
which is unchanged.¹¹⁹ However, the higher resonant frequencies cause a
change in timbre, resulting in a reedy, duck-like vocal quality. The
opposite effect, lowering resonant frequencies, can be obtained by inhaling
a dense gas such as sulfur hexafluoride or xenon.

Hazards

Inhaling helium can be dangerous if done to excess, since helium is a
simple asphyxiant and so displaces oxygen needed for normal respiration.⁹
¹²⁰ Fatalities have been recorded, including a youth who suffocated in
Vancouver in 2003 and two adults who suffocated in South Florida in
2006.¹²¹ ¹²² In 1998, an Australian girl (her age is not known) from
Victoria fell unconscious and temporarily turned blue after inhaling the
entire contents of a party balloon.¹²³ ¹²⁴ ¹²⁵ Breathing pure helium
continuously causes death by asphyxiation within minutes. This fact is used
in the design of suicide bags.

Inhaling helium directly from pressurized cylinders is extremely dangerous,
as the high flow rate can result in barotrauma, fatally rupturing lung
tissue.¹²⁰ ¹²⁶

Death caused by helium is rare. The first media-recorded case was that of a
15-year-old girl from Texas who died in 1998 from helium inhalation at a
friend's party; the exact type of helium death is unidentified.¹²³ ¹²⁴ ¹²⁵

In the United States only two fatalities were reported between 2000 and
2004, including a man who died in North Carolina of barotrauma in 2002.¹²¹
¹²⁶ A youth asphyxiated in Vancouver during 2003, and a 27-year-old man in
Australia had an embolism after breathing from a cylinder in 2000.¹²¹ Since
then two adults asphyxiated in South Florida in 2006,¹²¹ ¹²² ¹²⁷ and there
were cases in 2009 and 2010, one a Californian youth who was found with a
bag over his head, attached to a helium tank,¹²⁸ and another teenager in
Northern Ireland died of asphyxiation.¹²⁹ At Eagle Point, Oregon a teenage
girl died in 2012 from barotrauma at a party.¹³⁰ ¹³¹ ¹³² ¹³³ A girl from
Michigan died from hypoxia later in the year.¹³⁴

On February 4, 2015 it was revealed that during the recording of their main
TV show on January 28, a 12-year-old member (name withheld) of Japanese
all-girl singing group 3B Junior suffered from air embolism, losing
consciousness and falling in a coma as a result of air bubbles blocking the
flow of blood to the brain, after inhaling huge quantities of helium as
part of a game. The incident was not made public until a week later.¹³⁵ ¹³⁶
The staff of TV Asahi held an emergency press conference to communicate
that the member had been taken to the hospital and is showing signs of
rehabilitation such as moving eyes and limbs, but her consciousness has not
been sufficiently recovered as of yet. Police have launched an
investigation due to a neglect of safety measures.¹³⁷ ¹³⁸

The safety issues for cryogenic helium are similar to those of liquid
nitrogen; its extremely low temperatures can result in cold burns, and the
liquid-to-gas expansion ratio can cause explosions if no pressure-relief
devices are installed. Containers of helium gas at 5 to 10 K should be
handled as if they contain liquid helium due to the rapid and significant
thermal expansion that occurs when helium gas at less than 10 K is warmed
to room temperature.⁵¹

At high pressures (more than about 20 atm or two MPa), a mixture of helium
and oxygen (heliox) can lead to high-pressure nervous syndrome, a sort of
reverse-anesthetic effect; adding a small amount of nitrogen to the mixture
can alleviate the problem.¹³⁹ ¹⁴⁰

Hydrogen

This article is about the chemistry of hydrogen. For the physics of atomic
hydrogen, see Hydrogen atom. For other meanings, see Hydrogen
(disambiguation).

Hydrogen is a chemical element with chemical symbol H and atomic number 1.
With an atomic weight of 1.00794 u, hydrogen is the lightest element on the
periodic table. Its monatomic form (H) is the most abundant chemical
substance in the universe, constituting roughly 75% of all baryonic mass.⁹
[note 1] Non-remnant stars are mainly composed of hydrogen in its plasma
state. The most common isotope of hydrogen, termed protium (name rarely
used, symbol ¹H), has one proton and no neutrons.

The universal emergence of atomic hydrogen first occurred during the
recombination epoch. At standard temperature and pressure, hydrogen is a
colorless, odorless, tasteless, non-toxic, nonmetallic, highly combustible
diatomic gas with the molecular formula H₂. Since hydrogen readily forms
covalent compounds with most non-metallic elements, most of the hydrogen on
Earth exists in molecular forms such as in the form of water or organic
compounds. Hydrogen plays a particularly important role in acid–base
reactions as many acid-base reactions involve the exchange of protons
between soluble molecules. In ionic compounds, hydrogen can take the form
of a negative charge (i.e., anion) when it is known as a hydride, or as a
positively charged (i.e., cation) species denoted by the symbol H⁺. The
hydrogen cation is written as though composed of a bare proton, but in
reality, hydrogen cations in ionic compounds are always more complex
species than that would suggest. As the only neutral atom for which the
Schrödinger equation can be solved analytically,¹⁰ study of the energetics
and bonding of the hydrogen atom has played a key role in the development
of quantum mechanics.

Hydrogen gas was first artificially produced in the early 16th century, via
the mixing of metals with acids. In 1766–81, Henry Cavendish was the first
to recognize that hydrogen gas was a discrete substance,¹¹ and that it
produces water when burned, a property which later gave it its name: in
Greek, hydrogen means "water-former".

Industrial production is mainly from the steam reforming of natural gas,
and less often from more energy-intensive hydrogen production methods like
the electrolysis of water.¹² Most hydrogen is employed near its production
site, with the two largest uses being fossil fuel processing (e.g.,
hydrocracking) and ammonia production, mostly for the fertilizer market.
Hydrogen is a concern in metallurgy as it can embrittle many metals,¹³
complicating the design of pipelines and storage tanks.¹⁴

Properties

Combustion

Hydrogen gas (dihydrogen or molecular hydrogen)¹⁵ is highly flammable and
will burn in air at a very wide range of concentrations between 4% and 75%
by volume.¹⁶ The enthalpy of combustion for hydrogen is −286 kJ/mol:¹⁷

  2 H₂(g) + O₂(g) → 2 H₂O(l) + 572 kJ (286 kJ/mol)[note 2]

Hydrogen gas forms explosive mixtures with air if it is 4–74% concentrated
and with chlorine if it is 5–95% concentrated. The mixtures may be ignited
by spark, heat or sunlight. The hydrogen autoignition temperature, the
temperature of spontaneous ignition in air, is 500 °C (932 °F).¹⁸ Pure
hydrogen-oxygen flames emit ultraviolet light and with high oxygen mix are
nearly invisible to the naked eye, as illustrated by the faint plume of the
Space Shuttle Main Engine compared to the highly visible plume of a Space
Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster. The detection of a burning hydrogen leak may
require a flame detector; such leaks can be very dangerous. Hydrogen flames
in other conditions are blue, resembling blue natural gas flames.¹⁹ The
destruction of the Hindenburg airship was an infamous example of hydrogen
combustion; the cause is debated, but the visible orange flames were the
result of a rich mixture of hydrogen to oxygen combined with carbon
compounds from the airship skin.

H₂ reacts with every oxidizing element. Hydrogen can react spontaneously
and violently at room temperature with chlorine and fluorine to form the
corresponding hydrogen halides, hydrogen chloride and hydrogen fluoride,
which are also potentially dangerous acids.²⁰

Electron energy levels

Main article: Hydrogen atom

The ground state energy level of the electron in a hydrogen atom is −13.6
eV,²¹ which is equivalent to an ultraviolet photon of roughly 91 nm
wavelength.²²

The energy levels of hydrogen can be calculated fairly accurately using the
Bohr model of the atom, which conceptualizes the electron as "orbiting" the
proton in analogy to the Earth's orbit of the Sun. However, the
electromagnetic force attracts electrons and protons to one another, while
planets and celestial objects are attracted to each other by gravity.
Because of the discretization of angular momentum postulated in early
quantum mechanics by Bohr, the electron in the Bohr model can only occupy
certain allowed distances from the proton, and therefore only certain
allowed energies.²³

A more accurate description of the hydrogen atom comes from a purely
quantum mechanical treatment that uses the Schrödinger equation, Dirac
equation or even the Feynman path integral formulation to calculate the
probability density of the electron around the proton.²⁴ The most
complicated treatments allow for the small effects of special relativity
and vacuum polarization. In the quantum mechanical treatment, the electron
in a ground state hydrogen atom has no angular momentum at all—an
illustration of how the "planetary orbit" conception of electron motion
differs from reality.

Elemental molecular forms

See also: Spin isomers of hydrogen

There exist two different spin isomers of hydrogen diatomic molecules that
differ by the relative spin of their nuclei.²⁵ In the orthohydrogen form,
the spins of the two protons are parallel and form a triplet state with a
molecular spin quantum number of 1 (¹⁄₂+¹⁄₂); in the parahydrogen form the
spins are antiparallel and form a singlet with a molecular spin quantum
number of 0 (¹⁄₂–¹⁄₂). At standard temperature and pressure, hydrogen gas
contains about 25% of the para form and 75% of the ortho form, also known
as the "normal form".²⁶ The equilibrium ratio of orthohydrogen to
parahydrogen depends on temperature, but because the ortho form is an
excited state and has a higher energy than the para form, it is unstable
and cannot be purified. At very low temperatures, the equilibrium state is
composed almost exclusively of the para form. The liquid and gas phase
thermal properties of pure parahydrogen differ significantly from those of
the normal form because of differences in rotational heat capacities, as
discussed more fully in spin isomers of hydrogen.²⁷ The ortho/para
distinction also occurs in other hydrogen-containing molecules or
functional groups, such as water and methylene, but is of little
significance for their thermal properties.²⁸

The uncatalyzed interconversion between para and ortho H₂ increases with
increasing temperature; thus rapidly condensed H₂ contains large quantities
of the high-energy ortho form that converts to the para form very slowly.²⁹
The ortho/para ratio in condensed H₂ is an important consideration in the
preparation and storage of liquid hydrogen: the conversion from ortho to
para is exothermic and produces enough heat to evaporate some of the
hydrogen liquid, leading to loss of liquefied material. Catalysts for the
ortho-para interconversion, such as ferric oxide, activated carbon,
platinized asbestos, rare earth metals, uranium compounds,chromic oxide, or
some nickel³⁰ compounds, are used during hydrogen cooling.³¹

Compounds

Covalent and organic compounds

While H₂ is not very reactive under standard conditions, it does form
compounds with most elements. Hydrogen can form compounds with elements
that are more electronegative, such as halogens (e.g., F, Cl, Br, I), or
oxygen; in these compounds hydrogen takes on a partial positive charge.³²
When bonded to fluorine, oxygen, or nitrogen, hydrogen can participate in a
form of medium-strength noncovalent bonding with other similar molecules
between their hydrogens called hydrogen bonding, which is critical to the
stability of many biological molecules.³³ ³⁴ Hydrogen also forms compounds
with less electronegative elements, such as the metals and metalloids, in
which it takes on a partial negative charge. These compounds are often
known as hydrides.³⁵

Hydrogen forms a vast array of compounds with carbon called the
hydrocarbons, and an even vaster array with heteroatoms that, because of
their general association with living things, are called organic
compounds.³⁶ The study of their properties is known as organic chemistry³⁷
and their study in the context of living organisms is known as
biochemistry.³⁸ By some definitions, "organic" compounds are only required
to contain carbon. However, most of them also contain hydrogen, and because
it is the carbon-hydrogen bond which gives this class of compounds most of
its particular chemical characteristics, carbon-hydrogen bonds are required
in some definitions of the word "organic" in chemistry.³⁶ Millions of
hydrocarbons are known, and they are usually formed by complicated
synthetic pathways, which seldom involve elementary hydrogen.

Hydrides

Compounds of hydrogen are often called hydrides, a term that is used fairly
loosely. The term "hydride" suggests that the H atom has acquired a
negative or anionic character, denoted H−, and is used when hydrogen forms
a compound with a more electropositive element. The existence of the
hydride anion, suggested by Gilbert N. Lewis in 1916 for group I and II
salt-like hydrides, was demonstrated by Moers in 1920 by the electrolysis
of molten lithium hydride (LiH), producing a stoichiometry quantity of
hydrogen at the anode.³⁹ For hydrides other than group I and II metals, the
term is quite misleading, considering the low electronegativity of
hydrogen. An exception in group II hydrides is BeH
2, which is polymeric. In lithium aluminium hydride, the AlH−
4 anion carries hydridic centers firmly attached to the Al(III).

Although hydrides can be formed with almost all main-group elements, the
number and combination of possible compounds varies widely; for example,
there are over 100 binary borane hydrides known, but only one binary
aluminium hydride.⁴⁰ Binary indium hydride has not yet been identified,
although larger complexes exist.⁴¹

In inorganic chemistry, hydrides can also serve as bridging ligands that
link two metal centers in a coordination complex. This function is
particularly common in group 13 elements, especially in boranes (boron
hydrides) and aluminium complexes, as well as in clustered carboranes.⁴²

Protons and acids

Further information: Acid–base reaction

Oxidation of hydrogen removes its electron and gives H⁺, which contains no
electrons and a nucleus which is usually composed of one proton. That is
why H+
is often called a proton. This species is central to discussion of acids.
Under the Bronsted-Lowry theory, acids are proton donors, while bases are
proton acceptors.

A bare proton, H+
, cannot exist in solution or in ionic crystals, because of its unstoppable
attraction to other atoms or molecules with electrons. Except at the high
temperatures associated with plasmas, such protons cannot be removed from
the electron clouds of atoms and molecules, and will remain attached to
them. However, the term 'proton' is sometimes used loosely and
metaphorically to refer to positively charged or cationic hydrogen attached
to other species in this fashion, and as such is denoted "H+
" without any implication that any single protons exist freely as a
species.

To avoid the implication of the naked "solvated proton" in solution, acidic
aqueous solutions are sometimes considered to contain a less unlikely
fictitious species, termed the "hydronium ion" (H
3O+
). However, even in this case, such solvated hydrogen cations are more
realistically conceived as being organized into clusters that form species
closer to H
9O+
4.⁴³ Other oxonium ions are found when water is in acidic solution with
other solvents.⁴⁴

Although exotic on Earth, one of the most common ions in the universe is
the H+
3 ion, known as protonated molecular hydrogen or the trihydrogen cation.⁴⁵

Isotopes

Main article: Isotopes of hydrogen

Hydrogen has three naturally occurring isotopes, denoted 1
H, 2
H and 3
H. Other, highly unstable nuclei (4
H to 7
H) have been synthesized in the laboratory but not observed in nature.⁴⁶ ⁴⁷

- 1
H is the most common hydrogen isotope with an abundance of more than
  99.98%. Because the nucleus of this isotope consists of only a single
  proton, it is given the descriptive but rarely used formal name
  protium.⁴⁸
- 2
H, the other stable hydrogen isotope, is known as deuterium and contains
  one proton and one neutron in its nucleus. Essentially all deuterium in
  the universe is thought to have been produced at the time of the Big
  Bang, and has endured since that time. Deuterium is not radioactive, and
  does not represent a significant toxicity hazard. Water enriched in
  molecules that include deuterium instead of normal hydrogen is called
  heavy water. Deuterium and its compounds are used as a non-radioactive
  label in chemical experiments and in solvents for 1
H-NMR spectroscopy.⁴⁹ Heavy water is used as a neutron moderator and
  coolant for nuclear reactors. Deuterium is also a potential fuel for
  commercial nuclear fusion.⁵⁰
- 3
H is known as tritium and contains one proton and two neutrons in its
  nucleus. It is radioactive, decaying into helium-3 through beta decay
  with a half-life of 12.32 years.⁴² It is so radioactive that it can be
  used in luminous paint, making it useful in such things as watches. The
  glass prevents the small amount of radiation from getting out.⁵¹ Small
  amounts of tritium occur naturally because of the interaction of cosmic
  rays with atmospheric gases; tritium has also been released during
  nuclear weapons tests.⁵² It is used in nuclear fusion reactions,⁵³ as a
  tracer in isotope geochemistry,⁵⁴ and in specialized self-powered
  lighting devices.⁵⁵ Tritium has also been used in chemical and biological
  labeling experiments as a radiolabel.⁵⁶

Hydrogen is the only element that has different names for its isotopes in
common use today. During the early study of radioactivity, various heavy
radioactive isotopes were given their own names, but such names are no
longer used, except for deuterium and tritium. The symbols D and T (instead
of 2
H and 3
H) are sometimes used for deuterium and tritium, but the corresponding
symbol for protium, P, is already in use for phosphorus and thus is not
available for protium.⁵⁷ In its nomenclatural guidelines, the International
Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry allows any of D, T, 2
H, and 3
H to be used, although 2
H and 3
H are preferred.⁵⁸

History

Discovery and use

Main article: Timeline of hydrogen technologies

In 1671, Robert Boyle discovered and described the reaction between iron
filings and dilute acids, which results in the production of hydrogen
gas.⁵⁹ ⁶⁰ In 1766, Henry Cavendish was the first to recognize hydrogen gas
as a discrete substance, by naming the gas from a metal-acid reaction
"flammable air". He speculated that "flammable air" was in fact identical
to the hypothetical substance called "phlogiston"⁶¹ ⁶² and further finding
in 1781 that the gas produces water when burned. He is usually given credit
for its discovery as an element.⁶ ⁷ In 1783, Antoine Lavoisier gave the
element the name hydrogen (from the Greek ὑδρο- hydro meaning "water" and
-γενής genes meaning "creator")⁸ when he and Laplace reproduced Cavendish's
finding that water is produced when hydrogen is burned.⁷

Lavoisier produced hydrogen for his experiments on mass conservation by
reacting a flux of steam with metallic iron through an incandescent iron
tube heated in a fire. Anaerobic oxidation of iron by the protons of water
at high temperature can be schematically represented by the set of
following reactions:

  Fe +    H₂O → FeO + H₂
  2 Fe + 3 H₂O → Fe₂O₃ + 3 H₂
  3 Fe + 4 H₂O → Fe₃O₄ + 4 H₂

Many metals such as zirconium undergo a similar reaction with water leading
to the production of hydrogen.

Hydrogen was liquefied for the first time by James Dewar in 1898 by using
regenerative cooling and his invention, the vacuum flask.⁷ He produced
solid hydrogen the next year.⁷ Deuterium was discovered in December 1931 by
Harold Urey, and tritium was prepared in 1934 by Ernest Rutherford, Mark
Oliphant, and Paul Harteck.⁶ Heavy water, which consists of deuterium in
the place of regular hydrogen, was discovered by Urey's group in 1932.⁷
François Isaac de Rivaz built the first de Rivaz engine, an internal
combustion engine powered by a mixture of hydrogen and oxygen in 1806.
Edward Daniel Clarke invented the hydrogen gas blowpipe in 1819. The
Döbereiner's lamp and limelight were invented in 1823.⁷

The first hydrogen-filled balloon was invented by Jacques Charles in 1783.⁷
Hydrogen provided the lift for the first reliable form of air-travel
following the 1852 invention of the first hydrogen-lifted airship by Henri
Giffard.⁷ German count Ferdinand von Zeppelin promoted the idea of rigid
airships lifted by hydrogen that later were called Zeppelins; the first of
which had its maiden flight in 1900.⁷ Regularly scheduled flights started
in 1910 and by the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, they had carried
35,000 passengers without a serious incident. Hydrogen-lifted airships were
used as observation platforms and bombers during the war.

The first non-stop transatlantic crossing was made by the British airship
R34 in 1919. Regular passenger service resumed in the 1920s and the
discovery of helium reserves in the United States promised increased
safety, but the U.S. government refused to sell the gas for this purpose.
Therefore, H₂ was used in the Hindenburg airship, which was destroyed in a
midair fire over New Jersey on 6 May 1937.⁷ The incident was broadcast live
on radio and filmed. Ignition of leaking hydrogen is widely assumed to be
the cause, but later investigations pointed to the ignition of the
aluminized fabric coating by static electricity. But the damage to
hydrogen's reputation as a lifting gas was already done.

In the same year the first hydrogen-cooled turbogenerator went into service
with gaseous hydrogen as a coolant in the rotor and the stator in 1937 at
Dayton, Ohio, by the Dayton Power & Light Co.;⁶³ because of the thermal
conductivity of hydrogen gas, this is the most common type in its field
today.

The nickel hydrogen battery was used for the first time in 1977 aboard the
U.S. Navy's Navigation technology satellite-2 (NTS-2).⁶⁴ For example, the
ISS,⁶⁵ Mars Odyssey⁶⁶ and the Mars Global Surveyor⁶⁷ are equipped with
nickel-hydrogen batteries. In the dark part of its orbit, the Hubble Space
Telescope is also powered by nickel-hydrogen batteries, which were finally
replaced in May 2009,⁶⁸ more than 19 years after launch, and 13 years over
their design life.⁶⁹

Role in quantum theory

Because of its simple atomic structure, consisting only of a proton and an
electron, the hydrogen atom, together with the spectrum of light produced
from it or absorbed by it, has been central to the development of the
theory of atomic structure.⁷⁰ Furthermore, the corresponding simplicity of
the hydrogen molecule and the corresponding cation H+
2 allowed fuller understanding of the nature of the chemical bond, which
followed shortly after the quantum mechanical treatment of the hydrogen
atom had been developed in the mid-1920s.

One of the first quantum effects to be explicitly noticed (but not
understood at the time) was a Maxwell observation involving hydrogen, half
a century before full quantum mechanical theory arrived. Maxwell observed
that the specific heat capacity of H₂ unaccountably departs from that of a
diatomic gas below room temperature and begins to increasingly resemble
that of a monatomic gas at cryogenic temperatures. According to quantum
theory, this behavior arises from the spacing of the (quantized) rotational
energy levels, which are particularly wide-spaced in H₂ because of its low
mass. These widely spaced levels inhibit equal partition of heat energy
into rotational motion in hydrogen at low temperatures. Diatomic gases
composed of heavier atoms do not have such widely spaced levels and do not
exhibit the same effect.⁷¹

Antihydrogen (H) is the antimatter counterpart to hydrogen. It consists of
an antiproton with a positron. Antihydrogen is the only type of antimatter
atom to have been produced as of 2015.⁷² ⁷³

Natural occurrence

Hydrogen, as atomic H, is the most abundant chemical element in the
universe, making up 75% of normal matter by mass and over 90% by number of
atoms (most of the mass of the universe, however, is not in the form of
chemical-element type matter, but rather is postulated to occur as
yet-undetected forms of mass such as dark matter and dark energy).⁷⁴ This
element is found in great abundance in stars and gas giant planets.
Molecular clouds of H₂ are associated with star formation. Hydrogen plays a
vital role in powering stars through the proton-proton reaction and the CNO
cycle nuclear fusion.⁷⁵

Throughout the universe, hydrogen is mostly found in the atomic and plasma
states whose properties are quite different from molecular hydrogen. As a
plasma, hydrogen's electron and proton are not bound together, resulting in
very high electrical conductivity and high emissivity (producing the light
from the Sun and other stars). The charged particles are highly influenced
by magnetic and electric fields. For example, in the solar wind they
interact with the Earth's magnetosphere giving rise to Birkeland currents
and the aurora. Hydrogen is found in the neutral atomic state in the
interstellar medium. The large amount of neutral hydrogen found in the
damped Lyman-alpha systems is thought to dominate the cosmological baryonic
density of the Universe up to redshift z=4.⁷⁶

Under ordinary conditions on Earth, elemental hydrogen exists as the
diatomic gas, H₂. However, hydrogen gas is very rare in the Earth's
atmosphere (1 ppm by volume) because of its light weight, which enables it
to escape from Earth's gravity more easily than heavier gases. However,
hydrogen is the third most abundant element on the Earth's surface,⁷⁷
mostly in the form of chemical compounds such as hydrocarbons and water.⁴²
Hydrogen gas is produced by some bacteria and algae and is a natural
component of flatus, as is methane, itself a hydrogen source of increasing
importance.⁷⁸

A molecular form called protonated molecular hydrogen (H+
3) is found in the interstellar medium, where it is generated by ionization
of molecular hydrogen from cosmic rays. This charged ion has also been
observed in the upper atmosphere of the planet Jupiter. The ion is
relatively stable in the environment of outer space due to the low
temperature and density. H+
3 is one of the most abundant ions in the Universe, and it plays a notable
role in the chemistry of the interstellar medium.⁷⁹ Neutral triatomic
hydrogen H₃ can only exist in an excited form and is unstable.⁸⁰ By
contrast, the positive hydrogen molecular ion (H+
2) is a rare molecule in the universe.

Production

Main article: Hydrogen production

H
2 is produced in chemistry and biology laboratories, often as a by-product
of other reactions; in industry for the hydrogenation of unsaturated
substrates; and in nature as a means of expelling reducing equivalents in
biochemical reactions.

Metal-acid

In the laboratory, H
2 is usually prepared by the reaction of dilute non-oxidizing acids on some
reactive metals such as zinc with Kipp's apparatus.

  Zn + 2 H+
  → Zn2+
  + H
  2

Aluminium can also produce H
2 upon treatment with bases:

  2 Al + 6 H
  2O + 2 OH−
  → 2 Al(OH)−
  4 + 3 H
  2

The electrolysis of water is a simple method of producing hydrogen. A low
voltage current is run through the water, and gaseous oxygen forms at the
anode while gaseous hydrogen forms at the cathode. Typically the cathode is
made from platinum or another inert metal when producing hydrogen for
storage. If, however, the gas is to be burnt on site, oxygen is desirable
to assist the combustion, and so both electrodes would be made from inert
metals. (Iron, for instance, would oxidize, and thus decrease the amount of
oxygen given off.) The theoretical maximum efficiency (electricity used vs.
energetic value of hydrogen produced) is in the range 80–94%.⁸¹

  2 H
  2O(l) → 2 H
  2(g) + O
  2(g)

In 2007, it was discovered that an alloy of aluminium and gallium in pellet
form added to water could be used to generate hydrogen. The process also
creates alumina, but the expensive gallium, which prevents the formation of
an oxide skin on the pellets, can be re-used. This has important potential
implications for a hydrogen economy, as hydrogen can be produced on-site
and does not need to be transported.⁸²

Steam reforming

Hydrogen can be prepared in several different ways, but economically the
most important processes involve removal of hydrogen from hydrocarbons.
Commercial bulk hydrogen is usually produced by the steam reforming of
natural gas.⁸³ At high temperatures (1000–1400 K, 700–1100 °C or 1300–2000
°F), steam (water vapor) reacts with methane to yield carbon monoxide and H
2.

  CH
  4 + H
  2O → CO + 3 H
  2

This reaction is favored at low pressures but is nonetheless conducted at
high pressures (2.0  MPa, 20 atm or 600 inHg). This is because
high-pressure H
2 is the most marketable product and Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA)
purification systems work better at higher pressures. The product mixture
is known as "synthesis gas" because it is often used directly for the
production of methanol and related compounds. Hydrocarbons other than
methane can be used to produce synthesis gas with varying product ratios.
One of the many complications to this highly optimized technology is the
formation of coke or carbon:

  CH
  4 → C + 2 H
  2

Consequently, steam reforming typically employs an excess of H
2O. Additional hydrogen can be recovered from the steam by use of carbon
monoxide through the water gas shift reaction, especially with an iron
oxide catalyst. This reaction is also a common industrial source of carbon
dioxide:⁸³

  CO + H
  2O → CO
  2 + H
  2

Other important methods for H
2 production include partial oxidation of hydrocarbons:⁸⁴

  2 CH
  4 + O
  2 → 2 CO + 4 H
  2

and the coal reaction, which can serve as a prelude to the shift reaction
above:⁸³

  C + H
  2O → CO + H
  2

Hydrogen is sometimes produced and consumed in the same industrial process,
without being separated. In the Haber process for the production of
ammonia, hydrogen is generated from natural gas.⁸⁵ Electrolysis of brine to
yield chlorine also produces hydrogen as a co-product.⁸⁶

Thermochemical

There are more than 200 thermochemical cycles which can be used for water
splitting, around a dozen of these cycles such as the iron oxide cycle,
cerium(IV) oxide–cerium(III) oxide cycle, zinc zinc-oxide cycle,
sulfur-iodine cycle, copper-chlorine cycle and hybrid sulfur cycle are
under research and in testing phase to produce hydrogen and oxygen from
water and heat without using electricity.⁸⁷ A number of laboratories
(including in France, Germany, Greece, Japan, and the USA) are developing
thermochemical methods to produce hydrogen from solar energy and water.⁸⁸

Anaerobic corrosion

Under anaerobic conditions, iron and steel alloys are slowly oxidized by
the protons of water concomitantly reduced in molecular hydrogen (H
2). The anaerobic corrosion of iron leads first to the formation of ferrous
hydroxide (green rust) and can be described by the following reaction:

  Fe + 2 H
  2O → Fe(OH)
  2 + H
  2

In its turn, under anaerobic conditions, the ferrous hydroxide (Fe(OH)
2 ) can be oxidized by the protons of water to form magnetite and molecular
hydrogen. This process is described by the Schikorr reaction:

  3 Fe(OH)
  2 → Fe
  3O
  4 + 2 H
  2O + H
  2 ferrous hydroxide → magnetite + water + hydrogen

The well crystallized magnetite (Fe
3O
4) is thermodynamically more stable than the ferrous hydroxide (Fe(OH)
2 ).

This process occurs during the anaerobic corrosion of iron and steel in
oxygen-free groundwater and in reducing soils below the water table.

Geological occurrence: the serpentinization reaction

In the absence of atmospheric oxygen (O
2), in deep geological conditions prevailing far away from Earth
atmosphere, hydrogen (H
2) is produced during the process of serpentinization by the anaerobic
oxidation by the water protons (H⁺) of the ferrous (Fe²⁺) silicate present
in the crystal lattice of the fayalite (Fe
2SiO
4, the olivine iron-endmember). The corresponding reaction leading to the
formation of magnetite (Fe
3O
4), quartz (SiO
2) and hydrogen (H
2) is the following:

  3Fe
  2SiO
  4 + 2 H
  2O → 2 Fe
  3O
  4 + 3 SiO
  2 + 3 H
  2 fayalite + water → magnetite + quartz + hydrogen

This reaction closely resembles the Schikorr reaction observed in the
anaerobic oxidation of the ferrous hydroxide in contact with water.

Formation in transformers

From all the fault gases formed in power transformers, hydrogen is the most
common and is generated under most fault conditions; thus, formation of
hydrogen is an early indication of serious problems in the transformer's
life cycle.⁸⁹

Applications

Consumption in processes

Large quantities of H
2 are needed in the petroleum and chemical industries. The largest
application of H
2 is for the processing ("upgrading") of fossil fuels, and in the
production of ammonia. The key consumers of H
2 in the petrochemical plant include hydrodealkylation,
hydrodesulfurization, and hydrocracking. H
2 has several other important uses. H
2 is used as a hydrogenating agent, particularly in increasing the level of
saturation of unsaturated fats and oils (found in items such as margarine),
and in the production of methanol. It is similarly the source of hydrogen
in the manufacture of hydrochloric acid. H
2 is also used as a reducing agent of metallic ores.⁹⁰

Hydrogen is highly soluble in many rare earth and transition metals⁹¹ and
is soluble in both nanocrystalline and amorphous metals.⁹² Hydrogen
solubility in metals is influenced by local distortions or impurities in
the crystal lattice.⁹³ These properties may be useful when hydrogen is
purified by passage through hot palladium disks, but the gas's high
solubility is a metallurgical problem, contributing to the embrittlement of
many metals,¹³ complicating the design of pipelines and storage tanks.¹⁴

Apart from its use as a reactant, H
2 has wide applications in physics and engineering. It is used as a
shielding gas in welding methods such as atomic hydrogen welding.⁹⁴ ⁹⁵ H₂
is used as the rotor coolant in electrical generators at power stations,
because it has the highest thermal conductivity of any gas. Liquid H₂ is
used in cryogenic research, including superconductivity studies.⁹⁶ Because
H
2 is lighter than air, having a little more than ¹⁄₁₄ of the density of
air, it was once widely used as a lifting gas in balloons and airships.⁹⁷

In more recent applications, hydrogen is used pure or mixed with nitrogen
(sometimes called forming gas) as a tracer gas for minute leak detection.
Applications can be found in the automotive, chemical, power generation,
aerospace, and telecommunications industries.⁹⁸ Hydrogen is an authorized
food additive (E 949) that allows food package leak testing among other
anti-oxidizing properties.⁹⁹

Hydrogen's rarer isotopes also each have specific applications. Deuterium
(hydrogen-2) is used in nuclear fission applications as a moderator to slow
neutrons, and in nuclear fusion reactions.⁷ Deuterium compounds have
applications in chemistry and biology in studies of reaction isotope
effects.¹⁰⁰ Tritium (hydrogen-3), produced in nuclear reactors, is used in
the production of hydrogen bombs,¹⁰¹ as an isotopic label in the
biosciences,⁵⁶ and as a radiation source in luminous paints.¹⁰²

The triple point temperature of equilibrium hydrogen is a defining fixed
point on the ITS-90 temperature scale at 13.8033 kelvins.¹⁰³

Coolant

Main article: Hydrogen-cooled turbo generator

Hydrogen is commonly used in power stations as a coolant in generators due
to a number of favorable properties that are a direct result of its light
diatomic molecules. These include low density, low viscosity, and the
highest specific heat and thermal conductivity of all gases.

Energy carrier

See also: Hydrogen economy and Hydrogen infrastructure

Hydrogen is not an energy resource,¹⁰⁴ except in the hypothetical context
of commercial nuclear fusion power plants using deuterium or tritium, a
technology presently far from development.¹⁰⁵ The Sun's energy comes from
nuclear fusion of hydrogen, but this process is difficult to achieve
controllably on Earth.¹⁰⁶ Elemental hydrogen from solar, biological, or
electrical sources require more energy to make it than is obtained by
burning it, so in these cases hydrogen functions as an energy carrier, like
a battery. Hydrogen may be obtained from fossil sources (such as methane),
but these sources are unsustainable.¹⁰⁴

The energy density per unit volume of both liquid hydrogen and compressed
hydrogen gas at any practicable pressure is significantly less than that of
traditional fuel sources, although the energy density per unit fuel mass is
higher.¹⁰⁴ Nevertheless, elemental hydrogen has been widely discussed in
the context of energy, as a possible future carrier of energy on an
economy-wide scale.¹⁰⁷ For example, CO
2 sequestration followed by carbon capture and storage could be conducted
at the point of H
2 production from fossil fuels.¹⁰⁸ Hydrogen used in transportation would
burn relatively cleanly, with some NOₓ emissions,¹⁰⁹ but without carbon
emissions.¹⁰⁸ However, the infrastructure costs associated with full
conversion to a hydrogen economy would be substantial.¹¹⁰ Fuel cells can
convert hydrogen and oxygen directly to electricity more efficiently than
internal combustion engines.¹¹¹

Semiconductor industry

Hydrogen is employed to saturate broken ("dangling") bonds of amorphous
silicon and amorphous carbon that helps stabilizing material properties.¹¹²
It is also a potential electron donor in various oxide materials, including
ZnO,¹¹³ ¹¹⁴ SnO₂, CdO, MgO,¹¹⁵ ZrO₂, HfO₂, La₂O₃, Y₂O₃, TiO₂, SrTiO₃,
LaAlO₃, SiO₂, Al₂O₃, ZrSiO₄, HfSiO₄, and SrZrO₃.¹¹⁶

Biological reactions

Further information: Biohydrogen and Biological hydrogen production (Algae)

H₂ is a product of some types of anaerobic metabolism and is produced by
several microorganisms, usually via reactions catalyzed by iron- or
nickel-containing enzymes called hydrogenases. These enzymes catalyze the
reversible redox reaction between H₂ and its component two protons and two
electrons. Creation of hydrogen gas occurs in the transfer of reducing
equivalents produced during pyruvate fermentation to water.¹¹⁷ The natural
cycle of hydrogen production and consumption by organisms is called the
hydrogen cycle.¹¹⁸

Water splitting, in which water is decomposed into its component protons,
electrons, and oxygen, occurs in the light reactions in all photosynthetic
organisms. Some such organisms, including the alga Chlamydomonas
reinhardtii and cyanobacteria, have evolved a second step in the dark
reactions in which protons and electrons are reduced to form H₂ gas by
specialized hydrogenases in the chloroplast.¹¹⁹ Efforts have been
undertaken to genetically modify cyanobacterial hydrogenases to efficiently
synthesize H₂ gas even in the presence of oxygen.¹²⁰ Efforts have also been
undertaken with genetically modified alga in a bioreactor.¹²¹

Safety and precautions

Main article: Hydrogen safety

Hydrogen poses a number of hazards to human safety, from potential
detonations and fires when mixed with air to being an asphyxiant in its
pure, oxygen-free form.¹²² In addition, liquid hydrogen is a cryogen and
presents dangers (such as frostbite) associated with very cold liquids.¹²³
Hydrogen dissolves in many metals, and, in addition to leaking out, may
have adverse effects on them, such as hydrogen embrittlement,¹²⁴ leading to
cracks and explosions.¹²⁵ Hydrogen gas leaking into external air may
spontaneously ignite. Moreover, hydrogen fire, while being extremely hot,
is almost invisible, and thus can lead to accidental burns.¹²⁶

Even interpreting the hydrogen data (including safety data) is confounded
by a number of phenomena. Many physical and chemical properties of hydrogen
depend on the parahydrogen/orthohydrogen ratio (it often takes days or
weeks at a given temperature to reach the equilibrium ratio, for which the
data is usually given). Hydrogen detonation parameters, such as critical
detonation pressure and temperature, strongly depend on the container
geometry.¹²²

Infrared

For other uses, see Infrared (disambiguation).

Infrared (IR) is invisible radiant energy, electromagnetic radiation with
longer wavelengths than those of visible light, extending from the nominal
red edge of the visible spectrum at 700 nanometers (frequency 430 THz) to 1
mm (300 GHz)¹ (although people can see infrared up to at least 1050 nm in
experiments² ³ ⁴ ⁵ ). Most of the thermal radiation emitted by objects near
room temperature is infrared.

Infrared radiation was discovered in 1800 by astronomer Sir William
Herschel, who discovered a type of invisible radiation in the spectrum
lower in energy than red light, by means of its effect upon a thermometer.⁶
Slightly more than half of the total energy from the Sun was eventually
found to arrive on Earth in the form of infrared. The balance between
absorbed and emitted infrared radiation has a critical effect on Earth's
climate.

Infrared energy is emitted or absorbed by molecules when they change their
rotational-vibrational movements. Infrared energy excites vibrational modes
in a molecule through a change in the dipole moment, making it a useful
frequency range for study of these energy states for molecules of the
proper symmetry. Infrared spectroscopy examines absorption and transmission
of photons in the infrared energy range.⁷

Infrared radiation is used in industrial, scientific, and medical
applications. Night-vision devices using active near-infrared illumination
allow people or animals to be observed without the observer being detected.
Infrared astronomy uses sensor-equipped telescopes to penetrate dusty
regions of space, such as molecular clouds; detect objects such as planets,
and to view highly red-shifted objects from the early days of the
universe.⁸ Infrared thermal-imaging cameras are used to detect heat loss in
insulated systems, to observe changing blood flow in the skin, and to
detect overheating of electrical apparatus.

Thermal-infrared imaging is used extensively for military and civilian
purposes. Military applications include target acquisition, surveillance,
night vision, homing and tracking. Humans at normal body temperature
radiate chiefly at wavelengths around 10 μm (micrometers). Non-military
uses include thermal efficiency analysis, environmental monitoring,
industrial facility inspections, remote temperature sensing, short-ranged
wireless communication, spectroscopy, and weather forecasting.

Definition and relationship to the electromagnetic spectrum

Infrared radiation extends from the nominal red edge of the visible
spectrum at 700 nanometers (nm) to 1 mm. This range of wavelengths
corresponds to a frequency range of approximately 430 THz down to 300 GHz.
Below infrared is the microwave portion of the electromagnetic spectrum.

Natural infrared

Sunlight, at an effective temperature of 5,780 kelvins, is composed of
nearly thermal-spectrum radiation that is slightly more than half infrared.
At zenith, sunlight provides an irradiance of just over 1 kilowatt per
square meter at sea level. Of this energy, 527 watts is infrared radiation,
445 watts is visible light, and 32 watts is ultraviolet radiation.¹⁰

On the surface of Earth, at far lower temperatures than the surface of the
Sun, almost all thermal radiation consists of infrared in various
wavelengths. Of these natural thermal radiation processes only lightning
and natural fires are hot enough to produce much visible energy, and fires
produce far more infrared than visible-light energy.

Regions within the infrared

In general, objects emit infrared radiation across a spectrum of
wavelengths, but sometimes only a limited region of the spectrum is of
interest because sensors usually collect radiation only within a specific
bandwidth. Thermal infrared radiation also has a maximum emission
wavelength, which is inversely proportional to the absolute temperature of
object, in accordance with Wien's displacement law.

Therefore, the infrared band is often subdivided into smaller sections.

Commonly used sub-division scheme

A commonly used sub-division scheme is:¹¹

NIR and SWIR is sometimes called "reflected infrared," whereas MWIR and
LWIR is sometimes referred to as "thermal infrared." Due to the nature of
the blackbody radiation curves, typical 'hot' objects, such as exhaust
pipes, often appear brighter in the MW compared to the same object viewed
in the LW.

CIE division scheme

The International Commission on Illumination (CIE) recommended the division
of infrared radiation into the following three bands:¹³

- IR-A: 700 nm – 1400 nm (0.7 µm – 1.4 µm, 215 THz – 430 THz)
- IR-B: 1400 nm – 3000 nm (1.4 µm – 3 µm, 100 THz – 215 THz)
- IR-C: 3000 nm – 1 mm (3 µm – 1000 µm, 300 GHz – 100 THz)

ISO 20473 scheme

ISO 20473 specifies the following scheme:¹⁴

Astronomy division scheme

Astronomers typically divide the infrared spectrum as follows:¹⁵

These divisions are not precise and can vary depending on the publication.
The three regions are used for observation of different temperature ranges,
and hence different environments in space.

A photometric system used in astronomy allocates letters to different
spectral regions according to filters used; JHK is a frequent set for the
near-infrared, and this set of letters appears in the titles of many
papers.

Sensor response division scheme

A third scheme divides up the band based on the response of various
detectors:¹⁶

- Near-infrared: from 0.7 to 1.0 µm (from the approximate end of the
  response of the human eye to that of silicon).
- Short-wave infrared: 1.0 to 3 µm (from the cut-off of silicon to that of
  the MWIR atmospheric window). InGaAs covers to about 1.8 µm; the less
  sensitive lead salts cover this region.
- Mid-wave infrared: 3 to 5 µm (defined by the atmospheric window and
  covered by Indium antimonide [InSb] and HgCdTe and partially by lead
  selenide [PbSe]).
- Long-wave infrared: 8 to 12, or 7 to 14 µm (this is the atmospheric
  window covered by HgCdTe and microbolometers).
- Very-long wave infrared (VLWIR) (12 to about 30 µm, covered by doped
  silicon).

Near-infrared is the region closest in wavelength to the radiation
detectable by the human eye, mid- and far-infrared are progressively
further from the visible spectrum. Other definitions follow different
physical mechanisms (emission peaks, vs. bands, water absorption) and the
newest follow technical reasons (the common silicon detectors are sensitive
to about 1,050 nm, while InGaAs's sensitivity starts around 950 nm and ends
between 1,700 and 2,600 nm, depending on the specific configuration).
Unfortunately, international standards for these specifications are not
currently available.

The onset of infrared is defined (according to different standards) at
various values typically between 700 nm and 800 nm, but the boundary
between visible and infrared light is not precisely defined. The human eye
is markedly less sensitive to light above 700 nm wavelength, so longer
wavelengths make insignificant contributions to scenes illuminated by
common light sources. However, particularly intense near-IR light (e.g.,
from IR lasers, IR LED sources, or from bright daylight with the visible
light removed by colored gels) can be detected up to approximately 780 nm,
and will be perceived as red light. Sources providing wavelengths as long
as 1050 nm can be seen as a dull red glow in intense sources, causing some
difficulty in near-IR illumination of scenes in the dark (usually this
practical problem is solved by indirect illumination). Leaves are
particularly bright in the near IR, and if all visible light leaks from
around an IR-filter are blocked, and the eye is given a moment to adjust to
the extremely dim image coming through a visually opaque IR-passing
photographic filter, it is possible to see the Wood effect that consists of
IR-glowing foliage.¹⁷

Telecommunication bands in the infrared

In optical communications, the part of the infrared spectrum that is used
is divided into seven bands based on availability of light sources
transmitting/absorbing materials (fibers) and detectors:¹⁸

The C-band is the dominant band for long-distance telecommunication
networks. The S and L bands are based on less well established technology,
and are not as widely deployed.

Heat

Main article: Thermal radiation

Infrared radiation is popularly known as "heat radiation", but light and
electromagnetic waves of any frequency will heat surfaces that absorb them.
Infrared light from the Sun accounts for 49%¹⁹ of the heating of Earth,
with the rest being caused by visible light that is absorbed then
re-radiated at longer wavelengths. Visible light or ultraviolet-emitting
lasers can char paper and incandescently hot objects emit visible
radiation. Objects at room temperature will emit radiation concentrated
mostly in the 8 to 25 µm band, but this is not distinct from the emission
of visible light by incandescent objects and ultraviolet by even hotter
objects (see black body and Wien's displacement law).²⁰

Heat is energy in transit that flows due to temperature difference. Unlike
heat transmitted by thermal conduction or thermal convection, thermal
radiation can propagate through a vacuum. Thermal radiation is
characterized by a particular spectrum of many wavelengths that is
associated with emission from an object, due to the vibration of its
molecules at a given temperature. Thermal radiation can be emitted from
objects at any wavelength, and at very high temperatures such radiations
are associated with spectra far above the infrared, extending into visible,
ultraviolet, and even X-ray regions (i.e., the solar corona). Thus, the
popular association of infrared radiation with thermal radiation is only a
coincidence based on typical (comparatively low) temperatures often found
near the surface of planet Earth.

The concept of emissivity is important in understanding the infrared
emissions of objects. This is a property of a surface that describes how
its thermal emissions deviate from the ideal of a black body. To further
explain, two objects at the same physical temperature will not show the
same infrared image if they have differing emissivity. For example, for any
pre-set emissivity value, objects with higher emissivity will appear
hotter, and those with a lower emissivity will appear cooler. For that
reason, incorrect selection of emissivity will give inaccurate results when
using infrared cameras and pyrometers.

Applications

Night vision

Main article: Night vision

Infrared is used in night vision equipment when there is insufficient
visible light to see.²¹ Night vision devices operate through a process
involving the conversion of ambient light photons into electrons that are
then amplified by a chemical and electrical process and then converted back
into visible light.²¹ Infrared light sources can be used to augment the
available ambient light for conversion by night vision devices, increasing
in-the-dark visibility without actually using a visible light source.²¹

The use of infrared light and night vision devices should not be confused
with thermal imaging, which creates images based on differences in surface
temperature by detecting infrared radiation (heat) that emanates from
objects and their surrounding environment.²²

Thermography

Main article: Thermography

Infrared radiation can be used to remotely determine the temperature of
objects (if the emissivity is known). This is termed thermography, or in
the case of very hot objects in the NIR or visible it is termed pyrometry.
Thermography (thermal imaging) is mainly used in military and industrial
applications but the technology is reaching the public market in the form
of infrared cameras on cars due to the massively reduced production costs.

Thermographic cameras detect radiation in the infrared range of the
electromagnetic spectrum (roughly 900–14,000 nanometers or 0.9–14 μm) and
produce images of that radiation. Since infrared radiation is emitted by
all objects based on their temperatures, according to the black body
radiation law, thermography makes it possible to "see" one's environment
with or without visible illumination. The amount of radiation emitted by an
object increases with temperature, therefore thermography allows one to see
variations in temperature (hence the name).

Hyperspectral imaging

Main article: Hyperspectral imaging

A hyperspectral image, a basis for chemical imaging, is a "picture"
containing continuous spectrum through a wide spectral range. Hyperspectral
imaging is gaining importance in the applied spectroscopy particularly in
the fields of NIR, SWIR, MWIR, and LWIR spectral regions. Typical
applications include biological, mineralogical, defence, and industrial
measurements.

Thermal Infrared Hyperspectral Camera can be applied similarly to a
Thermographic camera, with the fundamental difference that each pixel
contains a full LWIR spectrum. Consequently, chemical identification of the
object can be performed without a need for an external light source such as
the Sun or the Moon. Such cameras are typically applied for geological
measurements, outdoor surveillance and UAV applications.²⁴

Other imaging

In infrared photography, infrared filters are used to capture the
near-infrared spectrum. Digital cameras often use infrared blockers.
Cheaper digital cameras and camera phones have less effective filters and
can "see" intense near-infrared, appearing as a bright purple-white color.
This is especially pronounced when taking pictures of subjects near
IR-bright areas (such as near a lamp), where the resulting infrared
interference can wash out the image. There is also a technique called
'T-ray' imaging, which is imaging using far-infrared or terahertz
radiation. Lack of bright sources can make terahertz photography more
challenging than most other infrared imaging techniques. Recently T-ray
imaging has been of considerable interest due to a number of new
developments such as terahertz time-domain spectroscopy.

Tracking

Main article: Infrared homing

Infrared tracking, also known as infrared homing, refers to a passive
missile guidance system, which uses the emission from a target of
electromagnetic radiation in the infrared part of the spectrum to track it.
Missiles that use infrared seeking are often referred to as "heat-seekers",
since infrared (IR) is just below the visible spectrum of light in
frequency and is radiated strongly by hot bodies. Many objects such as
people, vehicle engines, and aircraft generate and retain heat, and as
such, are especially visible in the infrared wavelengths of light compared
to objects in the background.²⁵

Heating

Main article: Infrared heating

Infrared radiation can be used as a deliberate heating source. For example,
it is used in infrared saunas to heat the occupants. It may also be used in
other heating applications, such as to remove ice from the wings of
aircraft (de-icing).²⁶ Infrared can be used in cooking and heating food as
it predominantly heats the opaque, absorbent objects, rather than the air
around them.

Infrared heating is also becoming more popular in industrial manufacturing
processes, e.g. curing of coatings, forming of plastics, annealing, plastic
welding, and print drying. In these applications, infrared heaters replace
convection ovens and contact heating.

Efficiency is achieved by matching the wavelength of the infrared heater to
the absorption characteristics of the material.

Communications

IR data transmission is also employed in short-range communication among
computer peripherals and personal digital assistants. These devices usually
conform to standards published by IrDA, the Infrared Data Association.
Remote controls and IrDA devices use infrared light-emitting diodes (LEDs)
to emit infrared radiation that is focused by a plastic lens into a narrow
beam. The beam is modulated, i.e. switched on and off, to encode the data.
The receiver uses a silicon photodiode to convert the infrared radiation to
an electric current. It responds only to the rapidly pulsing signal created
by the transmitter, and filters out slowly changing infrared radiation from
ambient light. Infrared communications are useful for indoor use in areas
of high population density. IR does not penetrate walls and so does not
interfere with other devices in adjoining rooms. Infrared is the most
common way for remote controls to command appliances. Infrared remote
control protocols like RC-5, SIRC, are used to communicate with infrared.

Free space optical communication using infrared lasers can be a relatively
inexpensive way to install a communications link in an urban area operating
at up to 4 gigabit/s, compared to the cost of burying fiber optic cable.

Infrared lasers are used to provide the light for optical fiber
communications systems. Infrared light with a wavelength around 1,330 nm
(least dispersion) or 1,550 nm (best transmission) are the best choices for
standard silica fibers.

IR data transmission of encoded audio versions of printed signs is being
researched as an aid for visually impaired people through the RIAS (Remote
Infrared Audible Signage) project.

Spectroscopy

Infrared vibrational spectroscopy (see also near-infrared spectroscopy) is
a technique that can be used to identify molecules by analysis of their
constituent bonds. Each chemical bond in a molecule vibrates at a frequency
characteristic of that bond. A group of atoms in a molecule (e.g., CH₂) may
have multiple modes of oscillation caused by the stretching and bending
motions of the group as a whole. If an oscillation leads to a change in
dipole in the molecule then it will absorb a photon that has the same
frequency. The vibrational frequencies of most molecules correspond to the
frequencies of infrared light. Typically, the technique is used to study
organic compounds using light radiation from 4000–400 cm−1, the
mid-infrared. A spectrum of all the frequencies of absorption in a sample
is recorded. This can be used to gain information about the sample
composition in terms of chemical groups present and also its purity (for
example, a wet sample will show a broad O-H absorption around 3200 cm−1).

Thin film metrology

In the semiconductor industry, infrared light can be used to characterize
materials such as thin films and periodic trench structures. By measuring
the reflectance of light from the surface of a semiconductor wafer, the
index of refraction (n) and the extinction Coefficient (k) can be
determined via the Forouhi-Bloomer dispersion equations. The reflectance
from the infrared light can also be used to determine the critical
dimension, depth, and sidewall angle of high aspect ratio trench
structures.

Meteorology

Weather satellites equipped with scanning radiometers produce thermal or
infrared images, which can then enable a trained analyst to determine cloud
heights and types, to calculate land and surface water temperatures, and to
locate ocean surface features. The scanning is typically in the range
10.3–12.5 µm (IR4 and IR5 channels).

High, cold ice clouds such as Cirrus or Cumulonimbus show up bright white,
lower warmer clouds such as Stratus or Stratocumulus show up as grey with
intermediate clouds shaded accordingly. Hot land surfaces will show up as
dark-grey or black. One disadvantage of infrared imagery is that low cloud
such as stratus or fog can be a similar temperature to the surrounding land
or sea surface and does not show up. However, using the difference in
brightness of the IR4 channel (10.3–11.5 µm) and the near-infrared channel
(1.58–1.64 µm), low cloud can be distinguished, producing a fog satellite
picture. The main advantage of infrared is that images can be produced at
night, allowing a continuous sequence of weather to be studied.

These infrared pictures can depict ocean eddies or vortices and map
currents such as the Gulf Stream, which are valuable to the shipping
industry. Fishermen and farmers are interested in knowing land and water
temperatures to protect their crops against frost or increase their catch
from the sea. Even El Niño phenomena can be spotted. Using color-digitized
techniques, the gray-shaded thermal images can be converted to color for
easier identification of desired information.

The main water vapour channel at 6.40 to 7.08 µm can be imaged by some
weather satellites and shows the amount of moisture in the atmosphere.

Climatology

In the field of climatology, atmospheric infrared radiation is monitored to
detect trends in the energy exchange between the earth and the atmosphere.
These trends provide information on long-term changes in Earth's climate.
It is one of the primary parameters studied in research into global
warming, together with solar radiation.

A pyrgeometer is utilized in this field of research to perform continuous
outdoor measurements. This is a broadband infrared radiometer with
sensitivity for infrared radiation between approximately 4.5 µm and 50 µm.

Astronomy

Main articles: Infrared astronomy and far-infrared astronomy

Astronomers observe objects in the infrared portion of the electromagnetic
spectrum using optical components, including mirrors, lenses and solid
state digital detectors. For this reason it is classified as part of
optical astronomy. To form an image, the components of an infrared
telescope need to be carefully shielded from heat sources, and the
detectors are chilled using liquid helium.

The sensitivity of Earth-based infrared telescopes is significantly limited
by water vapor in the atmosphere, which absorbs a portion of the infrared
radiation arriving from space outside of selected atmospheric windows. This
limitation can be partially alleviated by placing the telescope observatory
at a high altitude, or by carrying the telescope aloft with a balloon or an
aircraft. Space telescopes do not suffer from this handicap, and so outer
space is considered the ideal location for infrared astronomy.

The infrared portion of the spectrum has several useful benefits for
astronomers. Cold, dark molecular clouds of gas and dust in our galaxy will
glow with radiated heat as they are irradiated by imbedded stars. Infrared
can also be used to detect protostars before they begin to emit visible
light. Stars emit a smaller portion of their energy in the infrared
spectrum, so nearby cool objects such as planets can be more readily
detected. (In the visible light spectrum, the glare from the star will
drown out the reflected light from a planet.)

Infrared light is also useful for observing the cores of active galaxies,
which are often cloaked in gas and dust. Distant galaxies with a high
redshift will have the peak portion of their spectrum shifted toward longer
wavelengths, so they are more readily observed in the infrared.⁸

Art conservation and analysis

Infrared reflectography, as called by art conservators,²⁷ can be applied to
paintings to reveal underlying layers in a completely non-destructive
manner, in particular the underdrawing or outline drawn by the artist as a
guide. This often reveals the artist's use of carbon black, which shows up
well in reflectograms, as long as it has not also been used in the ground
underlying the whole painting. Art conservators are looking to see whether
the visible layers of paint differ from the underdrawing or layers in
between – such alterations are called pentimenti when made by the original
artist. This is very useful information in deciding whether a painting is
the prime version by the original artist or a copy, and whether it has been
altered by over-enthusiastic restoration work. In general, the more
pentimenti the more likely a painting is to be the prime version. It also
gives useful insights into working practices.²⁸

Among many other changes in the Arnolfini Portrait of 1434 (left), the
man's face was originally higher by about the height of his eye; the
woman's was higher, and her eyes looked more to the front. Each of his feet
was underdrawn in one position, painted in another, and then overpainted in
a third. These alterations are seen in infrared reflectograms.²⁹

Similar uses of infrared are made by conservators and scientists on various
types of objects, especially very old written documents such as the Dead
Sea Scrolls, the Roman works in the Villa of the Papyri, and the Silk Road
texts found in the Dunhuang Caves.³⁰ Carbon black used in ink can show up
extremely well.

Biological systems

Main article: Infrared sensing in snakes

The pit viper has a pair of infrared sensory pits on its head. There is
uncertainty regarding the exact thermal sensitivity of this biological
infrared detection system.³¹ ³²

Other organisms that have thermoreceptive organs are pythons (family
Pythonidae), some boas (family Boidae), the Common Vampire Bat (Desmodus
rotundus), a variety of jewel beetles (Melanophila acuminata),³³ darkly
pigmented butterflies (Pachliopta aristolochiae and Troides rhadamantus
plateni), and possibly blood-sucking bugs (Triatoma infestans).³⁴

Although near-infrared vision (780–1000 nm) has long been deemed impossible
due to noise in visual pigments,³⁵ sensation of near-infrared light was
reported in the common carp and in three cichlid species.³⁵ ³⁶ ³⁷ ³⁸ ³⁹
Fish use NIR to capture prey³⁵ and for phototactic swimming orientation.³⁹
NIR sensation in fish may be relevant under poor lighting conditions during
twilight³⁵ and in turbid surface waters.³⁹

Photobiomodulation

Near-infrared light, or photobiomodulation, is used for treatment of
chemotherapy-induced oral ulceration as well as wound healing. There is
some work relating to anti-herpes virus treatment.⁴⁰ Research projects
include work on central nervous system healing effects via cytochrome c
oxidase upregulation and other possible mechanisms.⁴¹

Health hazard

Strong infrared radiation in certain industry high-heat settings may be
hazardous to the eyes, resulting in damage or blindness to the user. Since
the radiation is invisible, special IR-proof goggles must be worn in such
places.⁴²

Earth as an infrared emitter

Earth's surface and the clouds absorb visible and invisible radiation from
the sun and re-emit much of the energy as infrared back to atmosphere.
Certain substances in the atmosphere, chiefly cloud droplets and water
vapor, but also carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, sulfur
hexafluoride, and chlorofluorocarbons,⁴³ absorb this infrared, and
re-radiate it in all directions including back to Earth. Thus, the
greenhouse effect keeps the atmosphere and surface much warmer than if the
infrared absorbers were absent from the atmosphere.⁴⁴

History of infrared science

The discovery of infrared radiation is ascribed to William Herschel, the
astronomer, in the early 19th century. Herschel published his results in
1800 before the Royal Society of London. Herschel used a prism to refract
light from the sun and detected the infrared, beyond the red part of the
spectrum, through an increase in the temperature recorded on a thermometer.
He was surprised at the result and called them "Calorific Rays". The term
'Infrared' did not appear until late in the 19th century.⁴⁵ ⁴⁶

Interstellar medium

In astronomy, the interstellar medium (ISM) is the matter that exists in
the space between the star systems in a galaxy. This matter includes gas in
ionic, atomic, and molecular form, as well as dust and cosmic rays. It
fills interstellar space and blends smoothly into the surrounding
intergalactic space. The energy that occupies the same volume, in the form
of electromagnetic radiation, is the interstellar radiation field.

The interstellar medium is composed of multiple phases, distinguished by
whether matter is ionic, atomic, or molecular, and the temperature and
density of the matter. The interstellar medium is composed primarily by
hydrogen followed by helium with trace amounts of carbon, oxygen, and
nitrogen comparatively to hydrogen.¹ The thermal pressures of these phases
are in rough equilibrium with one another. Magnetic fields and turbulent
motions also provide pressure in the ISM, and are typically more important
dynamically than the thermal pressure is.

In all phases, the interstellar medium is extremely tenuous by terrestrial
standards. In cool, dense regions of the ISM, matter is primarily in
molecular form, and reaches number densities of 10⁶ molecules per cm³. In
hot, diffuse regions of the ISM, matter is primarily ionized, and the
density may be as low as 10−4 ions per cm³. Compare this with a number
density of roughly 10¹⁹ molecules per cm³ for air, and 10¹⁰ molecules per
cm³ for a laboratory high-vacuum chamber. By mass, 99% of the ISM is gas in
any form, and 1% is dust.² Of the gas in the ISM, by number 91% of atoms
are hydrogen and 9% are helium, with 0.1% being atoms of elements heavier
than hydrogen or helium,³ known as "metals" in astronomical parlance. By
mass this amounts to 70% hydrogen, 28% helium, and 1.5% heavier elements.
The hydrogen and helium are primarily a result of primordial
nucleosynthesis, while the heavier elements in the ISM are mostly a result
of enrichment in the process of stellar evolution.

The ISM plays a crucial role in astrophysics precisely because of its
intermediate role between stellar and galactic scales. Stars form within
the densest regions of the ISM, molecular clouds, and replenish the ISM
with matter and energy through planetary nebulae, stellar winds, and
supernovae. This interplay between stars and the ISM helps determine the
rate at which a galaxy depletes its gaseous content, and therefore its
lifespan of active star formation.

On September 12, 2013, NASA officially announced that Voyager 1 had reached
the ISM on August 25, 2012, making it the first artificial object to do so.
Interstellar plasma and dust will be studied until the mission's end in
2025.

Interstellar matter

Table 1 shows a breakdown of the properties of the components of the ISM of
the Milky Way.

The three-phase model

Field, Goldsmith & Habing (1969) put forward the static two phase
equilibrium model to explain the observed properties of the ISM. Their
modeled ISM consisted of a cold dense phase (T < 300 K), consisting of
clouds of neutral and molecular hydrogen, and a warm intercloud phase (T ~
10⁴ K), consisting of rarefied neutral and ionized gas. McKee & Ostriker
(1977) added a dynamic third phase that represented the very hot (T ~ 10⁶
K) gas which had been shock heated by supernovae and constituted most of
the volume of the ISM. These phases are the temperatures where heating and
cooling can reach a stable equilibrium. Their paper formed the basis for
further study over the past three decades. However, the relative
proportions of the phases and their subdivisions are still not well known.³

Structures

The ISM is turbulent and therefore full of structure on all spatial scales.
Stars are born deep inside large complexes of molecular clouds, typically a
few parsecs in size. During their lives and deaths, stars interact
physically with the ISM.

Stellar winds from young clusters of stars (often with giant or supergiant
HII regions surrounding them) and shock waves created by supernovae inject
enormous amounts of energy into their surroundings, which leads to
hypersonic turbulence. The resultant structures – of varying sizes – can be
observed, such as stellar wind bubbles and superbubbles of hot gas, seen by
X-ray satellite telescopes or turbulent flows observed in radio telescope
maps.

The Sun is currently traveling through the Local Interstellar Cloud, a
denser region in the low-density Local Bubble.

Interaction with interplanetary medium

The interstellar medium begins where the interplanetary medium of the Solar
System ends. The solar wind slows to subsonic velocities at the termination
shock, 90—100 astronomical units from the Sun. In the region beyond the
termination shock, called the heliosheath, interstellar matter interacts
with the solar wind. Voyager 1, the farthest human-made object from the
Earth (after 1998⁵ ), crossed the termination shock December 16, 2004 and
later entered interstellar space when it crossed the heliopause on August
25, 2012, providing the first direct probe of conditions in the ISM (Stone
et al. 2005).

Interstellar extinction

The ISM is also responsible for extinction and reddening, the decreasing
light intensity and shift in the dominant observable wavelengths of light
from a star. These effects are caused by scattering and absorption of
photons and allow the ISM to be observed with the naked eye in a dark sky.
The apparent rifts that can be seen in the band of the Milky Way— a uniform
disk of stars— are caused by absorption of background starlight by
molecular clouds within a few thousand light years from Earth.

Far ultraviolet light is absorbed effectively by the neutral components of
the ISM. For example, a typical absorption wavelength of atomic hydrogen
lies at about 121.5 nanometers, the Lyman-alpha transition. Therefore, it
is nearly impossible to see light emitted at that wavelength from a star
farther than a few hundred light years from Earth, because most of it is
absorbed during the trip to Earth by intervening neutral hydrogen.

Heating and cooling

The ISM is usually far from thermodynamic equilibrium. Collisions establish
a Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution of velocities, and the 'temperature'
normally used to describe interstellar gas is the 'kinetic temperature',
which describes the temperature at which the particles would have the
observed Maxwell–Boltzmann velocity distribution in thermodynamic
equilibrium. However, the interstellar radiation field is typically much
weaker than a medium in thermodynamic equilibrium; it is most often roughly
that of an A star (surface temperature of ~10,000 K) highly diluted.
Therefore, bound levels within an atom or molecule in the ISM are rarely
populated according to the Boltzmann formula (Spitzer 1978, § 2.4).

Depending on the temperature, density, and ionization state of a portion of
the ISM, different heating and cooling mechanisms determine the temperature
of the gas.

Heating mechanisms

Heating by low-energy cosmic rays The first mechanism proposed for heating
  the ISM was heating by low-energy cosmic rays. Cosmic rays are an
  efficient heating source able to penetrate in the depths of molecular
  clouds. Cosmic rays transfer energy to gas through both ionization and
  excitation and to free electrons through Coulomb interactions. Low-energy
  cosmic rays (a few MeV) are more important because they are far more
  numerous than high-energy cosmic rays.
Photoelectric heating in grains The ultraviolet radiation emitted by hot
  stars can remove electrons from dust grains. The photon hits the dust
  grain, and some of its energy is used in overcoming the potential energy
  barrier (due to the possible positive charge of the grain) to remove the
  electron from the grain. The remainder of the photon's energy heats the
  grain and gives the ejected electron kinetic energy. Since the size
  distribution of dust grains is n(r) \propto r^{-3.5}, where r is the size
  of the dust particle, the grain area distribution is r^2 n \propto
  r^{-1.5}. This indicates that the smallest dust grains dominate this
  method of heating.
Photoionization When an electron is freed from an atom (typically from
  absorption of a UV photon) it carries kinetic energy away of the order:
  E_{photon} - E_{ionization}. This heating mechanism dominates in HII
  regions, but is negligible in the diffuse ISM due to the relative lack of
  neutral carbon atoms.
X-ray heating X-rays remove electrons from atoms and ions, and those
  photoelectrons can provoke secondary ionizations. As the intensity is
  often low, this heating is only efficient in warm, less dense atomic
  medium (as the column density is small). For example in molecular clouds
  only hard x-rays can penetrate and x-ray heating can be ignored. This is
  assuming the region is not near an x-ray source such as a supernova
  remnant.
Chemical heating Molecular hydrogen (H₂) can be formed on the surface of
  dust grains when two H atoms (which can travel over the grain) meet. This
  process yields 4.48 eV of energy distributed over the rotational and
  vibrational modes, kinetic energy of the H₂ molecule, as well as heating
  the dust grain. This kinetic energy, as well as the energy transferred
  from de-excitation of the hydrogen molecule through collisions, heats the
  gas.
Grain-gas heating Collisions at high densities between gas atoms and
  molecules with dust grains can transfer thermal energy. This is not
  important in HII regions because UV radiation is more important. It is
  also not important in diffuse ionized medium due to the low density. In
  the neutral diffuse medium grains are always colder, but do not
  effectively cool the gas due to the low densities.

Grain heating by thermal exchange is very important in supernova remnants
where densities and temperatures are very high.

Gas heating via grain-gas collisions is dominant deep in giant molecular
clouds (especially at high densities). Far infrared radiation penetrates
deeply due to the low optical depth. Dust grains are heated via this
radiation and can transfer thermal energy during collisions with the gas. A
measure of efficiency in the heating is given by the accommodation
coefficient:

α= \frac{T₂ - T}{T_d - T}

where T is the gas temperature, T_d the dust temperature, and T₂ the
post-collision temperature of the gas atom/molecule. This coefficient was
measured by (Burke & Hollenbach 1983) as α= 0.35.

Other heating mechanisms A variety of macroscopic heating mechanisms are
  present including:
  + Gravitational collapse of a cloud
  + Supernova explosions
  + Stellar winds
  + Expansion of H II regions
  + Magnetohydrodynamic waves created by supernova remnants

Cooling mechanisms

Fine structure cooling The process of fine structure cooling is dominant in
  most regions of the Interstellar Medium, except regions of hot gas and
  regions deep in molecular clouds. It occurs most efficiently with
  abundant atoms having fine structure levels close to the fundamental
  level such as: CII and OI in the neutral medium and OII, OIII, NII, NIII,
  NeII and NeIII in HII regions. Collisions will excite these atoms to
  higher levels, and they will eventually de-excite through photon
  emission, which will carry the energy out of the region.
Cooling by permitted lines At lower temperatures, more levels than fine
  structure levels can be populated via collisions. For example,
  collisional excitation of the n=2 level of hydrogen will release a Lyα
  photon upon de-excitation. In molecular clouds, excitation of rotational
  lines of CO is important. Once a molecule is excited, it eventually
  returns to a lower energy state, emitting a photon which can leave the
  region, cooling the cloud.

Radiowave propagation

Radio waves from ≈10 kHz (very low frequency) to ≈300 GHz (extremely high
frequency) propagate differently in interstellar space than on the Earth's
surface. There are many sources of interference and signal distortion that
do not exist on Earth. A great deal of radio astronomy depends on
compensating for the different propagation effects to uncover the desired
signal.⁶ ⁷

The history of knowledge of interstellar space

The nature of the interstellar medium has received the attention of
astronomers and scientists over the centuries, and understanding of the ISM
has developed. However, they first had to acknowledge the basic concept of
"interstellar" space. The term appears to have been first used in print by
Bacon (1626, § 354–5): "The Interstellar Skie.. hath .. so much Affinity
with the Starre, that there is a Rotation of that, as well as of the
Starre." Later, natural philosopher Robert Boyle (1674) discussed "The
inter-stellar part of heaven, which several of the modern Epicureans would
have to be empty."

Before modern electromagnetic theory, early physicists postulated that an
invisible luminiferous aether existed as a medium to carry lightwaves. It
was assumed that this aether extended into interstellar space, as Patterson
(1862) wrote, "this efflux occasions a thrill, or vibratory motion, in the
ether which fills the interstellar spaces."

The advent of deep photographic imaging allowed Edward Barnard to produce
the first images of dark nebulae silhouetted against the background star
field of the galaxy, while the first actual detection of cold diffuse
matter in interstellar space was made by Johannes Hartmann in 1904⁹ through
the use of absorption line spectroscopy. In his historic study of the
spectrum and orbit of Delta Orionis, Hartmann observed the light coming
from this star and realized that some of this light was being absorbed
before it reached the Earth. Hartmann reported that absorption from the "K"
line of calcium appeared "extraordinarily weak, but almost perfectly sharp"
and also reported the "quite surprising result that the calcium line at
393.4 nanometres does not share in the periodic displacements of the lines
caused by the orbital motion of the spectroscopic binary star". The
stationary nature of the line led Hartmann to conclude that the gas
responsible for the absorption was not present in the atmosphere of Delta
Orionis, but was instead located within an isolated cloud of matter
residing somewhere along the line-of-sight to this star. This discovery
launched the study of the Interstellar Medium.

In the series of investigations, Viktor Ambartsumian introduced the now
commonly accepted notion that interstellar matter occurs in the form of
clouds.¹⁰

Following Hartmann's identification of interstellar calcium absorption,
interstellar sodium was detected by Heger (1919) through the observation of
stationary absorption from the atom's "D" lines at 589.0 and 589.6
nanometres towards Delta Orionis and Beta Scorpii.

Subsequent observations of the "H" and "K" lines of calcium by Beals (1936)
revealed double and asymmetric profiles in the spectra of Epsilon and Zeta
Orionis. These were the first steps in the study of the very complex
interstellar sightline towards Orion. Asymmetric absorption line profiles
are the result of the superposition of multiple absorption lines, each
corresponding to the same atomic transition (for example the "K" line of
calcium), but occurring in interstellar clouds with different radial
velocities. Because each cloud has a different velocity (either towards or
away from the observer/Earth) the absorption lines occurring within each
cloud are either Blue-shifted or Red-shifted (respectively) from the lines'
rest wavelength, through the Doppler Effect. These observations confirming
that matter is not distributed homogeneously were the first evidence of
multiple discrete clouds within the ISM.

The growing evidence for interstellar material led Pickering (1912) to
comment that "While the interstellar absorbing medium may be simply the
ether, yet the character of its selective absorption, as indicated by
Kapteyn, is characteristic of a gas, and free gaseous molecules are
certainly there, since they are probably constantly being expelled by the
Sun and stars."

The same year Victor Hess's discovery of cosmic rays, highly energetic
charged particles that rain onto the Earth from space, led others to
speculate whether they also pervaded interstellar space. The following year
the Norwegian explorer and physicist Kristian Birkeland wrote: "It seems to
be a natural consequence of our points of view to assume that the whole of
space is filled with electrons and flying electric ions of all kinds. We
have assumed that each stellar system in evolutions throws off electric
corpuscles into space. It does not seem unreasonable therefore to think
that the greater part of the material masses in the universe is found, not
in the solar systems or nebulae, but in 'empty' space" (Birkeland 1913).

Thorndike (1930) noted that "it could scarcely have been believed that the
enormous gaps between the stars are completely void. Terrestrial aurorae
are not improbably excited by charged particles from the Sun emitted by the
Sun. If the millions of other stars are also ejecting ions, as is
undoubtedly true, no absolute vacuum can exist within the galaxy."

In September 2012, NASA scientists reported that polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons (PAHs), subjected to interstellar medium (ISM) conditions, are
transformed, through hydrogenation, oxygenation and hydroxylation, to more
complex organics - "a step along the path toward amino acids and
nucleotides, the raw materials of proteins and DNA, respectively".¹² ¹³
Further, as a result of these transformations, the PAHs lose their
spectroscopic signature which could be one of the reasons "for the lack of
PAH detection in interstellar ice grains, particularly the outer regions of
cold, dense clouds or the upper molecular layers of protoplanetary
disks."¹² ¹³

In February 2014, NASA announced a greatly upgraded database for tracking
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the universe. According to
scientists, more than 20% of the carbon in the universe may be associated
with PAHs, possible starting materials for the formation of life. PAHs seem
to have been formed shortly after the Big Bang, are widespread throughout
the universe, and are associated with new stars and exoplanets.¹⁴

Ion

For other uses, see Ion (disambiguation).

An ion (/ˈaɪən, -ɒn/)¹ is an atom or a molecule in which the total number
of electrons is not equal to the total number of protons, giving the atom
or molecule a net positive or negative electrical charge.

Ions can be created, by either chemical or physical means, via ionization.
In chemical terms, if a neutral atom loses one or more electrons, it has a
net positive charge and is known as a cation. If an atom gains electrons,
it has a net negative charge and is known as an anion. An ion consisting of
a single atom is an atomic or monatomic ion; if it consists of two or more
atoms, it is a molecular or polyatomic ion. Because of their electric
charges, cations and anions attract each other and readily form ionic
compounds, such as salts.

In the case of physical ionization of a medium, such as a gas, what are
known as "ion pairs" are created by ion impact, and each pair consists of a
free electron and a positive ion.²

History of discovery

The word ion is the Greek ἰόν, ion, "going", the present participle of
ἰέναι, ienai, "to go". This term was introduced by English physicist and
chemist Michael Faraday in 1834 for the then-unknown species that goes from
one electrode to the other through an aqueous medium.³ ⁴ Faraday did not
know the nature of these species, but he knew that since metals dissolved
into and entered a solution at one electrode, and new metal came forth from
a solution at the other electrode, that some kind of substance moved
through the solution in a current, conveying matter from one place to the
other.

Faraday also introduced the words anion for a negatively charged ion, and
cation for a positively charged one. In Faraday's nomenclature, cations
were named because they were attracted to the cathode in a galvanic device
and anions were named due to their attraction to the anode.

Characteristics

Ions in their gas-like state are highly reactive, and do not occur in large
amounts on Earth, except in flames, lightning, electrical sparks, and other
plasmas. These gas-like ions rapidly interact with ions of opposite charge
to give neutral molecules or ionic salts. Ions are also produced in the
liquid or solid state when salts interact with solvents (for example,
water) to produce "solvated ions," which are more stable, for reasons
involving a combination of energy and entropy changes as the ions move away
from each other to interact with the liquid. These stabilized species are
more commonly found in the environment at low temperatures. A common
example is the ions present in seawater, which are derived from the
dissolved salts.

All ions are charged, which means that like all charged objects they are:

- attracted to opposite electric charges (positive to negative, and vice
  versa),
- repelled by like charges
- when moving, travel in trajectories that are deflected by a magnetic
  field.

Electrons, due to their smaller mass and thus larger space-filling
properties as matter waves, determine the size of atoms and molecules that
possess any electrons at all. Thus, anions (negatively charged ions) are
larger than the parent molecule or atom, as the excess electron(s) repel
each other, and add to the physical size of the ion, because its size is
determined by its electron cloud. As such, in general, cations are smaller
than the corresponding parent atom or molecule due to the smaller size of
its electron cloud. One particular cation (that of hydrogen) contains no
electrons, and thus consists of a single proton - very much smaller than
the parent hydrogen atom.

Anions and cations

"Cation" and "Anion" redirect here. For the particle physics/quantum
computing concept, see Anyon. For other uses, see Ion (disambiguation).

Since the electric charge on a proton is equal in magnitude to the charge
on an electron, the net electric charge on an ion is equal to the number of
protons in the ion minus the number of electrons.

An anion (−) (/ˈæn.aɪ.ən/ AN-eye-ən), from the Greek word ἄνω (ánō),
meaning "up",⁵ is an ion with more electrons than protons, giving it a net
negative charge (since electrons are negatively charged and protons are
positively charged).⁶

A cation (+) (/ˈkæt.aɪ.ən/ KAT-eye-ən), from the Greek word κατά (katá),
meaning "down",⁷ is an ion with fewer electrons than protons, giving it a
positive charge.⁸

There are many names used for ions with multiple charges. For example, an
ion with a −2 charge is known as a dianion and an ion with a +2 charge is
known as a dication. A zwitterion is a neutral molecule with positive and
negative charges at different locations within that molecule.⁹

Natural occurrences

Ions are ubiquitous in nature and are responsible for diverse phenomena
from the luminescence of the Sun to the existence of the Earth's
ionosphere. Atoms in their ionic state may have a different color from
neutral atoms, and thus light absorption by metal ions gives the color of
gemstones. In both inorganic and organic chemistry (including
biochemistry), the interaction of water and ions is extremely important; an
example is the energy that drives breakdown of adenosine triphosphate
(ATP). The following sections describe contexts in which ions feature
prominently; these are arranged in decreasing physical length-scale, from
the astronomical to the microscopic.

Astronomical

A collection of non-aqueous gas-like ions, or even a gas containing a
proportion of charged particles, is called a plasma. Greater than 99.9% of
visible matter in the Universe may be in the form of plasmas.¹⁰ These
include our Sun and other stars and the space between planets, as well as
the space in between stars. Plasmas are often called the fourth state of
matter because their properties are substantially different from those of
solids, liquids, and gases. Astrophysical plasmas predominantly contain a
mixture of electrons and protons (ionized hydrogen).

Related technology

Ions can be non-chemically prepared using various ion sources, usually
involving high voltage or temperature. These are used in a multitude of
devices such as mass spectrometers, optical emission spectrometers,
particle accelerators, ion implanters, and ion engines.

As reactive charged particles, they are also used in air purification by
disrupting microbes, and in household items such as smoke detectors.

As signaling and metabolism in organisms are controlled by a precise ionic
gradient across membranes, the disruption of this gradient contributes to
cell death. This is a common mechanism exploited by natural and artificial
biocides, including the ion channels gramicidin and amphotericin (a
fungicide).

Inorganic dissolved ions are a component of total dissolved solids, an
indicator of water quality in the world.

Detection of ionising radiation

The ionising effect of radiation on a gas is extensively used for the
detection of radiation such as alpha, beta, gamma and X-rays. The original
ionisation event in these instruments results in the formation of an "ion
pair"; a positive ion and a free electron, by ion impact by the radiation
on the gas molecules. The ionization chamber is the simplest of these
detectors, and collects all the charges created by direct ionisation within
the gas through the application of an electric field.²

The Geiger–Müller tube and the proportional counter both use a phenomenon
known as a Townsend avalanche to multiply the effect of the original
ionising event by means of a cascade effect whereby the free electrons are
given sufficient energy by the electric field to release further electrons
by ion impact.

Chemistry

Notation

Denoting the charged state

When writing the chemical formula for an ion, its net charge is written in
superscript immediately after the chemical structure for the molecule/atom.
The net charge is written with the magnitude before the sign; that is, a
doubly charged cation is indicated as 2+ instead of +2. However, the
magnitude of the charge is omitted for singly charged molecules/atoms; for
example, the sodium cation is indicated as Na⁺ and not Na¹⁺.

An alternative (and acceptable) way of showing a molecule/atom with
multiple charges is by drawing out the signs multiple times; this is often
seen with transition metals. Chemists sometimes circle the sign; this is
merely ornamental and does not alter the chemical meaning. All three
representations of Fe2+
shown in the figure are, thus, equivalent.

Monatomic ions are sometimes also denoted with Roman numerals; for example,
the Fe2+
example seen above is occasionally referred to as Fe(II) or FeII. The Roman
numeral designates the formal oxidation state of an element, whereas the
superscripted numerals denotes the net charge. The two notations are,
therefore, exchangeable for monatomic ions, but the Roman numerals cannot
be applied to polyatomic ions. However, it is possible to mix the notations
for the individual metal center with a polyatomic complex, as shown by the
uranyl ion example.

Sub-classes

If an ion contains unpaired electrons, it is called a radical ion. Just
like uncharged radicals, radical ions are very reactive. Polyatomic ions
containing oxygen, such as carbonate and sulfate, are called oxyanions.
Molecular ions that contain at least one carbon to hydrogen bond are called
organic ions. If the charge in an organic ion is formally centered on a
carbon, it is termed a carbocation (if positively charged) or carbanion (if
negatively charged).

Formation

Formation of monatomic ions

Monatomic ions are formed by the gain or loss of electrons to the valence
shell (the outer-most electron shell) in an atom. The inner shells of an
atom are filled with electrons that are tightly bound to the positively
charged atomic nucleus, and so do not participate in this kind of chemical
interaction. The process of gaining or losing electrons from a neutral atom
or molecule is called ionization.

Atoms can be ionized by bombardment with radiation, but the more usual
process of ionization encountered in chemistry is the transfer of electrons
between atoms or molecules. This transfer is usually driven by the
attaining of stable ("closed shell") electronic configurations. Atoms will
gain or lose electrons depending on which action takes the least energy.

For example, a sodium atom, Na, has a single electron in its valence shell,
surrounding 2 stable, filled inner shells of 2 and 8 electrons. Since these
filled shells are very stable, a sodium atom tends to lose its extra
electron and attain this stable configuration, becoming a sodium cation in
the process

  Na → Na+
  + e−

On the other hand, a chlorine atom, Cl, has 7 electrons in its valence
shell, which is one short of the stable, filled shell with 8 electrons.
Thus, a chlorine atom tends to gain an extra electron and attain a stable
8-electron configuration, becoming a chloride anion in the process:

  Cl + e− → Cl−

This driving force is what causes sodium and chlorine to undergo a chemical
reaction, wherein the "extra" electron is transferred from sodium to
chlorine, forming sodium cations and chloride anions. Being oppositely
charged, these cations and anions form ionic bonds and combine to form
sodium chloride, NaCl, more commonly known as table salt.

  Na+
  + Cl−
  → NaCl

Formation of polyatomic and molecular ions

Polyatomic and molecular ions are often formed by the gaining or losing of
elemental ions such as a proton, H⁺, in neutral molecules. For example,
when ammonia, NH₃, accepts a proton, H⁺—a process called protonation—it
forms the ammonium ion, NH₄⁺. Ammonia and ammonium have the same number of
electrons in essentially the same electronic configuration, but ammonium
has an extra proton that gives it a net positive charge.

Ammonia can also lose an electron to gain a positive charge, forming the
ion ·NH+
3. However, this ion is unstable, because it has an incomplete valence
shell around the nitrogen atom, making it a very reactive radical ion.

Due to the instability of radical ions, polyatomic and molecular ions are
usually formed by gaining or losing elemental ions such as H+
, rather than gaining or losing electrons. This allows the molecule to
preserve its stable electronic configuration while acquiring an electrical
charge.

Ionization potential

Main article: Ionization potential

The energy required to detach an electron in its lowest energy state from
an atom or molecule of a gas with less net electric charge is called the
ionization potential, or ionization energy. The nth ionization energy of an
atom is the energy required to detach its nth electron after the first n −
1 electrons have already been detached.

Each successive ionization energy is markedly greater than the last.
Particularly great increases occur after any given block of atomic orbitals
is exhausted of electrons. For this reason, ions tend to form in ways that
leave them with full orbital blocks. For example, sodium has one valence
electron in its outermost shell, so in ionized form it is commonly found
with one lost electron, as Na+
. On the other side of the periodic table, chlorine has seven valence
electrons, so in ionized form it is commonly found with one gained
electron, as Cl−
. Caesium has the lowest measured ionization energy of all the elements and
helium has the greatest.¹¹ In general, the ionization energy of metals is
much lower than the ionization energy of nonmetals, which is why, in
general, metals will lose electrons to form positively charged ions and
nonmetals will gain electrons to form negatively charged ions.

Ionic bonding

Main article: Ionic bond

Ionic bonding is a kind of chemical bonding that arises from the mutual
attraction of oppositely charged ions. Ions of like charge repel each
other, and ions of opposite charge attract each other. Therefore, ions do
not usually exist on their own, but will bind with ions of opposite charge
to form a crystal lattice. The resulting compound is called an ionic
compound, and is said to be held together by ionic bonding. In ionic
compounds there arise characteristic distances between ion neighbors from
which the spatial extension and the ionic radius of individual ions may be
derived.

The most common type of ionic bonding is seen in compounds of metals and
nonmetals (except noble gases, which rarely form chemical compounds).
Metals are characterized by having a small number of electrons in excess of
a stable, closed-shell electronic configuration. As such, they have the
tendency to lose these extra electrons in order to attain a stable
configuration. This property is known as electropositivity. Non-metals, on
the other hand, are characterized by having an electron configuration just
a few electrons short of a stable configuration. As such, they have the
tendency to gain more electrons in order to achieve a stable configuration.
This tendency is known as electronegativity. When a highly electropositive
metal is combined with a highly electronegative nonmetal, the extra
electrons from the metal atoms are transferred to the electron-deficient
nonmetal atoms. This reaction produces metal cations and nonmetal anions,
which are attracted to each other to form a salt.

Iron

This article is about the metallic element. For other uses, see Iron
(disambiguation).

Iron is a chemical element with symbol Fe (from Latin: ferrum) and atomic
number 26. It is a metal in the first transition series.⁴ It is by mass the
most common element on Earth, forming much of Earth's outer and inner core.
It is the fourth most common element in the Earth's crust. Its abundance in
rocky planets like Earth is due to its abundant production by fusion in
high-mass stars, where the production of nickel-56 (which decays to the
most common isotope of iron) is the last nuclear fusion reaction that is
exothermic. Consequently, radioactive nickel is the last element to be
produced before the violent collapse of a supernova scatters precursor
radionuclide of iron into space.

Like other group 8 elements, iron exists in a wide range of oxidation
states, −2 to +6, although +2 and +3 are the most common. Elemental iron
occurs in meteoroids and other low oxygen environments, but is reactive to
oxygen and water. Fresh iron surfaces appear lustrous silvery-gray, but
oxidize in normal air to give hydrated iron oxides, commonly known as rust.
Unlike many other metals which form passivating oxide layers, iron oxides
occupy more volume than the metal and thus flake off, exposing fresh
surfaces for corrosion.

Iron metal has been used since ancient times, although copper alloys, which
have lower melting temperatures, were used even earlier in human history.
Pure iron is relatively soft, but is unobtainable by smelting. The material
is significantly hardened and strengthened by impurities, in particular
carbon, from the smelting process. A certain proportion of carbon (between
0.002% and 2.1%) produces steel, which may be up to 1000 times harder than
pure iron. Crude iron metal is produced in blast furnaces, where ore is
reduced by coke to pig iron, which has a high carbon content. Further
refinement with oxygen reduces the carbon content to the correct proportion
to make steel. Steels and low carbon iron alloys along with other metals
(alloy steels) are by far the most common metals in industrial use, due to
their great range of desirable properties and the widespread abundance of
iron-bearing rock.

Iron chemical compounds have many uses. Iron oxide mixed with aluminium
powder can be ignited to create a thermite reaction, used in welding and
purifying ores. Iron forms binary compounds with the halogens and the
chalcogens. Among its organometallic compounds is ferrocene, the first
sandwich compound discovered.

Iron plays an important role in biology, forming complexes with molecular
oxygen in hemoglobin and myoglobin; these two compounds are common oxygen
transport proteins in vertebrates. Iron is also the metal at the active
site of many important redox enzymes dealing with cellular respiration and
oxidation and reduction in plants and animals.

Characteristics

Mechanical properties

The mechanical properties of iron and its alloys can be evaluated using a
variety of tests, including the Brinell test, Rockwell test and the Vickers
hardness test. The data on iron is so consistent that it is often used to
calibrate measurements or to compare tests.⁶ ⁷ However, the mechanical
properties of iron are significantly affected by the sample's purity: pure
research-purpose single crystals of iron are actually softer than
aluminium,⁵ and the purest industrially produced iron (99.99%) has a
hardness of 20–30 Brinell.⁸ An increase in the carbon content of the iron
will initially cause a significant corresponding increase in the iron's
hardness and tensile strength. Maximum hardness of 65 Rc is achieved with a
0.6% carbon content, although this produces a metal with a low tensile
strength.⁹

Because of its significance for planetary cores, the physical properties of
iron at high pressures and temperatures have also been studied extensively.
The form of iron that is stable under standard conditions can be subjected
to pressures up to ca. 15 GPa before transforming into a high-pressure
form, as described in the next section.

Phase diagram and allotropes

Main article: Allotropes of iron

Iron represents an example of allotropy in a metal. There are at least four
allotropic forms of iron, known as α, γ, δ, and ε; at very high pressures,
some controversial experimental evidence exists for a phase β stable at
very high pressures and temperatures.¹⁰

As molten iron cools it crystallizes at 1538 °C into its δ allotrope, which
has a body-centered cubic (bcc) crystal structure. As it cools further to
1394 °C, it changes to its γ-iron allotrope, a face-centered cubic (fcc)
crystal structure, or austenite. At 912 °C and below, the crystal structure
again becomes the bcc α-iron allotrope, or ferrite. Finally, at 770 °C (the
Curie point, Tc) iron becomes magnetic. As the iron passes through the
Curie temperature there is no change in crystalline structure, but there is
a change in "domain structure", where each domain contains iron atoms with
a particular electronic spin. In unmagnetized iron, all the electronic
spins of the atoms within one domain are in the same direction, however,
the neighboring domains point in various other directions and thus over all
they cancel each other out. As a result, the iron is unmagnetized. In
magnetized iron, the electronic spins of all the domains are aligned, so
that the magnetic effects of neighboring domains reinforce each other.
Although each domain contains billions of atoms, they are very small, about
10 micrometres across.¹¹ At pressures above approximately 10 GPa and
temperatures of a few hundred kelvin or less, α-iron changes into a
hexagonal close-packed (hcp) structure, which is also known as ε-iron; the
higher-temperature γ-phase also changes into ε-iron, but does so at higher
pressure. The β-phase, if it exists, would appear at pressures of at least
50 GPa and temperatures of at least 1500 K; it has been thought to have an
orthorhombic or a double hcp structure.¹⁰

Iron is of greatest importance when mixed with certain other metals and
with carbon to form steels. There are many types of steels, all with
different properties, and an understanding of the properties of the
allotropes of iron is key to the manufacture of good quality steels.

α-iron, also known as ferrite, is the most stable form of iron at normal
temperatures. It is a fairly soft metal that can dissolve only a small
concentration of carbon (no more than 0.021% by mass at 910 °C).¹²

Above 912 °C and up to 1400 °C α-iron undergoes a phase transition from bcc
to the fcc configuration of γ-iron, also called austenite. This is
similarly soft and metallic but can dissolve considerably more carbon (as
much as 2.04% by mass at 1146 °C). This form of iron is used in the type of
stainless steel used for making cutlery, and hospital and food-service
equipment.¹¹

The high-pressure phases of iron are important as endmember models for the
solid parts of planetary cores. The inner core of the Earth is generally
assumed to consist essentially of an iron-nickel alloy with ε (or β)
structure.

The melting point of iron is experimentally well defined for pressures up
to approximately 50 GPa. For higher pressures, different studies placed the
γ-ε-liquid triple point at pressures differing by tens of gigapascals and
yielded differences of more than 1000 K for the melting point. Generally
speaking, molecular dynamics computer simulations of iron melting and shock
wave experiments suggest higher melting points and a much steeper slope of
the melting curve than static experiments carried out in diamond anvil
cells.¹³

Isotopes

Main article: Isotopes of iron

Naturally occurring iron consists of four stable isotopes: 5.845% of ⁵⁴Fe,
91.754% of ⁵⁶Fe, 2.119% of ⁵⁷Fe and 0.282% of ⁵⁸Fe. Of these stable
isotopes, only ⁵⁷Fe has a nuclear spin (−¹⁄₂). The nuclide ⁵⁴Fe is
predicted to undergo double beta decay, but this process had never been
observed experimentally for these nuclei, and only the lower limit on the
half-life was established: t1/2>3.1×10²² years.

⁶⁰Fe is an extinct radionuclide of long half-life (2.6 million years).¹⁴ It
is not found on Earth, but its ultimate decay product is the stable nuclide
nickel-60.

Much of the past work on measuring the isotopic composition of Fe has
focused on determining ⁶⁰Fe variations due to processes accompanying
nucleosynthesis (i.e., meteorite studies) and ore formation. In the last
decade however, advances in mass spectrometry technology have allowed the
detection and quantification of minute, naturally occurring variations in
the ratios of the stable isotopes of iron. Much of this work has been
driven by the Earth and planetary science communities, although
applications to biological and industrial systems are beginning to
emerge.¹⁵

The most abundant iron isotope ⁵⁶Fe is of particular interest to nuclear
scientists as it represents the most common endpoint of nucleosynthesis. It
is often cited, falsely, as the isotope of highest binding energy, a
distinction which actually belongs to nickel-62.¹⁶ Since ⁵⁶Ni is easily
produced from lighter nuclei in the alpha process in nuclear reactions in
supernovae (see silicon burning process), nickel-56 (14 alpha particles) is
the endpoint of fusion chains inside extremely massive stars, since
addition of another alpha particle would result in zinc-60, which requires
a great deal more energy. This nickel-56, which has a half-life of about 6
days, is therefore made in quantity in these stars, but soon decays by two
successive positron emissions within supernova decay products in the
supernova remnant gas cloud, first to radioactive cobalt-56, and then
stable iron-56. This last nuclide is therefore common in the universe,
relative to other stable metals of approximately the same atomic weight.

In phases of the meteorites Semarkona and Chervony Kut a correlation
between the concentration of ⁶⁰Ni, the daughter product of ⁶⁰Fe, and the
abundance of the stable iron isotopes could be found which is evidence for
the existence of ⁶⁰Fe at the time of formation of the Solar System.
Possibly the energy released by the decay of ⁶⁰Fe contributed, together
with the energy released by decay of the radionuclide ²⁶Al, to the
remelting and differentiation of asteroids after their formation 4.6
billion years ago. The abundance of ⁶⁰Ni present in extraterrestrial
material may also provide further insight into the origin of the Solar
System and its early history.¹⁷

Nuclei of iron atoms have some of the highest binding energies per nucleon,
surpassed only by the nickel isotope ⁶²Ni. This is formed by nuclear fusion
in stars. Although a further tiny energy gain could be extracted by
synthesizing ⁶²Ni, conditions in stars are unsuitable for this process to
be favored. Elemental distribution on Earth greatly favors iron over
nickel, and also presumably in supernova element production.¹⁸

Iron-56 is the heaviest stable isotope produced by the alpha process in
stellar nucleosynthesis; elements heavier than iron and nickel require a
supernova for their formation. Iron is the most abundant element in the
core of red giants, and is the most abundant metal in iron meteorites and
in the dense metal cores of planets such as Earth.

Nucleosynthesis

Iron is created by extremely large stars with extremely hot (over 2.5
billion kelvin) cores through the silicon burning process. It is the
heaviest stable element to be produced in this manner. The process starts
with the second largest stable nucleus created by silicon burning, which is
calcium. One stable nucleus of calcium fuses with one helium nucleus,
creating unstable titanium. Before the titanium decays, it can fuse with
another helium nucleus, creating unstable chromium. Before the chromium
decays, it can fuse with another helium nucleus, creating unstable iron.
Before the iron decays, it can fuse with another helium nucleus, creating
unstable nickel-56. Any further fusion of nickel-56 consumes energy instead
of producing energy, so after the production of nickel-56, the star does
not produce the energy necessary to keep the core from collapsing.
Eventually, the nickel-56 decays to unstable cobalt-56, which in turn
decays to stable iron-56. When the core of the star collapses, it creates a
supernova. Supernovas also create additional forms of stable iron via the
r-process.

Occurrence

See also: Category:Iron minerals.

Planetary occurrence

Iron is the sixth most abundant element in the Universe, and the most
common refractory element.¹⁹ It is formed as the final exothermic stage of
stellar nucleosynthesis, by silicon fusion in massive stars.

Metallic or native iron is rarely found on the surface of the Earth because
it tends to oxidize, but its oxides are pervasive and represent the primary
ores. While it makes up about 5% of the Earth's crust, both the Earth's
inner and outer core are believed to consist largely of an iron-nickel
alloy constituting 35% of the mass of the Earth as a whole. Iron is
consequently the most abundant element on Earth, but only the fourth most
abundant element in the Earth's crust.²⁰ ²¹ Most of the iron in the crust
is found combined with oxygen as iron oxide minerals such as hematite
(Fe₂O₃) and magnetite (Fe₃O₄). Large deposits of iron are found in banded
iron formations. These geological formations are a type of rock consisting
of repeated thin layers of iron oxides alternating with bands of iron-poor
shale and chert. The banded iron formations were laid down in the time
between 3,700 million years ago and 1,800 million years ago²² ²³

About 1 in 20 meteorites consist of the unique iron-nickel minerals taenite
(35–80% iron) and kamacite (90–95% iron). Although rare, iron meteorites
are the main form of natural metallic iron on the Earth's surface.²⁴

The red color of the surface of Mars is derived from an iron oxide-rich
regolith. This has been proven by Mössbauer spectroscopy.²⁵

Stocks in use in society

According to the International Resource Panel's Metal Stocks in Society
report, the global stock of iron in use in society is 2200 kg per capita.
Much of this is in more-developed countries (7000–14000 kg per capita)
rather than less-developed countries (2000 kg per capita).

Chemistry and compounds

See also: Category:Iron compounds.

Iron forms compounds mainly in the +2 and +3 oxidation states.
Traditionally, iron(II) compounds are called ferrous, and iron(III)
compounds ferric. Iron also occurs in higher oxidation states, an example
being the purple potassium ferrate (K₂FeO₄) which contains iron in its +6
oxidation state. Iron(IV) is a common intermediate in many biochemical
oxidation reactions.²⁶ ²⁷ Numerous organometallic compounds contain formal
oxidation states of +1, 0, −1, or even −2. The oxidation states and other
bonding properties are often assessed using the technique of Mössbauer
spectroscopy.²⁸ There are also many mixed valence compounds that contain
both iron(II) and iron(III) centers, such as magnetite and Prussian blue
(Fe₄(Fe[CN]₆)₃).²⁷ The latter is used as the traditional "blue" in
blueprints.²⁹

The iron compounds produced on the largest scale in industry are iron(II)
sulfate (FeSO₄·7H₂O) and iron(III) chloride (FeCl₃). The former is one of
the most readily available sources of iron(II), but is less stable to
aerial oxidation than Mohr's salt ((NH₄)₂Fe(SO₄)₂·6H₂O). Iron(II) compounds
tend to be oxidized to iron(III) compounds in the air.²⁷

Unlike many other metals, iron does not form amalgams with mercury. As a
result, mercury is traded in standardized 76 pound flasks (34 kg) made of
iron.³⁰

Binary compounds

Iron reacts with oxygen in the air to form various oxide and hydroxide
compounds; the most common are iron(II,III) oxide (Fe₃O₄), and iron(III)
oxide (Fe₂O₃). Iron(II) oxide also exists, though it is unstable at room
temperature. These oxides are the principal ores for the production of iron
(see bloomery and blast furnace). They are also used in the production of
ferrites, useful magnetic storage media in computers, and pigments. The
best known sulfide is iron pyrite (FeS₂), also known as fool's gold owing
to its golden luster.²⁷

The binary ferrous and ferric halides are well known, with the exception of
ferric iodide. The ferrous halides typically arise from treating iron metal
with the corresponding binary halogen acid to give the corresponding
hydrated salts.²⁷

  Fe + 2 HX → FeX₂ + H₂

Iron reacts with fluorine, chlorine, and bromine to give the corresponding
ferric halides, ferric chloride being the most common:

  2 Fe + 3 X₂ → 2 FeX₃ (X = F, Cl, Br)

Coordination and organometallic compounds

See also: Organoiron chemistry

Several cyanide complexes are known. The most famous example is Prussian
blue, (Fe₄(Fe[CN]₆)₃). Potassium ferricyanide and potassium ferrocyanide
are also known; the formation of Prussian blue upon reaction with iron(II)
and iron(III) respectively forms the basis of a "wet" chemical test.²⁷
Prussian blue is also used as an antidote for thallium and radioactive
caesium poisoning.³¹ ³² Prussian blue can be used in laundry bluing to
correct the yellowish tint left by ferrous salts in water.

Several carbonyl compounds of iron are known. The premier iron(0) compound
is iron pentacarbonyl, Fe(CO)₅, which is used to produce carbonyl iron
powder, a highly reactive form of metallic iron. Thermolysis of iron
pentacarbonyl gives the trinuclear cluster, triiron dodecacarbonyl.
Collman's reagent, disodium tetracarbonylferrate, is a useful reagent for
organic chemistry; it contains iron in the −2 oxidation state.
Cyclopentadienyliron dicarbonyl dimer contains iron in the rare +1
oxidation state.³³

Ferrocene is an extremely stable complex. The first sandwich compound, it
contains an iron(II) center with two cyclopentadienyl ligands bonded
through all ten carbon atoms. This arrangement was a shocking novelty when
it was first discovered,³⁴ but the discovery of ferrocene has led to a new
branch of organometallic chemistry. Ferrocene itself can be used as the
backbone of a ligand, e.g. dppf. Ferrocene can itself be oxidized to the
ferrocenium cation (Fc⁺); the ferrocene/ferrocenium couple is often used as
a reference in electrochemistry.³⁵

History

Main article: History of ferrous metallurgy

Wrought iron

Further information: Ancient iron production

Iron objects of great age are much rarer than objects made of gold or
silver due to the ease of corrosion of iron.³⁶ Beads made from meteoric
iron in 3500 BCE or earlier were found in Gerzah, Egypt by G. A.
Wainwright.³⁷ The beads contain 7.5% nickel, which is a signature of
meteoric origin since iron found in the Earth's crust has very little to no
nickel content. Meteoric iron was highly regarded due to its origin in the
heavens and was often used to forge weapons and tools or whole specimens
placed in churches.³⁷ Items that were likely made of iron by Egyptians date
from 2500 to 3000 BCE.³⁶ Iron had a distinct advantage over bronze in
warfare implements. It was much harder and more durable than bronze,
although susceptible to rust. However, this is contested. Hittitologist
Trevor Bryce argues that before advanced iron-working techniques were
developed in India, meteoritic iron weapons used by early Mesopotamian
armies had a tendency to shatter in combat, due to their high carbon
content.³⁸

The first iron production started in the Middle Bronze Age but it took
several centuries before iron displaced bronze. Samples of smelted iron
from Asmar, Mesopotamia and Tall Chagar Bazaar in northern Syria were made
sometime between 2700 and 3000 BCE.³⁹ The Hittites appear to be the first
to understand the production of iron from its ores and regard it highly in
their society. They began to smelt iron between 1500 and 1200 BCE and the
practice spread to the rest of the Near East after their empire fell in
1180 BCE.³⁹ The subsequent period is called the Iron Age. Iron smelting,
and thus the Iron Age, reached Europe two hundred years later and arrived
in Zimbabwe, Africa by the 8th century.³⁹ In China, iron only appears circa
700–500 BCE.⁴⁰ Iron smelting may have been introduced into China through
Central Asia.⁴¹ The earliest evidence of the use of a blast furnace in
China dates to the 1st century AD,⁴² and cupola furnaces were used as early
as the Warring States period (403–221 BCE).⁴³ Usage of the blast and cupola
furnace remained widespread during the Song and Tang Dynasties.⁴⁴

Artifacts of smelted iron are found in India dating from 1800 to 1200
BCE,⁴⁵ and in the Levant from about 1500 BCE (suggesting smelting in
Anatolia or the Caucasus).⁴⁶ ⁴⁷

The Book of Genesis, fourth chapter, verse 22 contains the first mention of
iron in the Old Testament of the Bible; "Tubal-cain, an instructor of every
artificer in brass and iron."³⁶ Other verses allude to iron mining (Job
28:2), iron used as a stylus (Job 19:24), furnace (Deuteronomy 4:20),
chariots (Joshua 17:16), nails (I Chron. 22:3), saws and axes (II Sam.
12:31), and cooking utensils (Ezekiel 4:3).⁴⁸ The metal is also mentioned
in the New Testament, for example in Acts chapter 12 verse 10, "[Peter
passed through] the iron gate that leadeth unto the city" of Antioch.⁴⁹

Iron working was introduced to Greece in the late 11th century BCE.⁵⁰ The
spread of ironworking in Central and Western Europe is associated with
Celtic expansion. According to Pliny the Elder, iron use was common in the
Roman era.³⁷ The annual iron output of the Roman Empire is estimated at
84,750 t,⁵¹ while the similarly populous Han China produced around 5,000
t.⁵²

During the Industrial Revolution in Britain, Henry Cort began refining iron
from pig iron to wrought iron (or bar iron) using innovative production
systems. In 1783 he patented the puddling process for refining iron ore. It
was later improved by others, including Joseph Hall.

Cast iron

Cast iron was first produced in China during 5th century BCE,⁵³ but was
hardly in Europe until the medieval period.⁵⁴ ⁵⁵ The earliest cast iron
artifacts were discovered by archaeologists in what is now modern Luhe
County, Jiangsu in China. Cast iron was used in ancient China for warfare,
agriculture, and architecture.⁵⁶ During the medieval period, means were
found in Europe of producing wrought iron from cast iron (in this context
known as pig iron) using finery forges. For all these processes, charcoal
was required as fuel.

Medieval blast furnaces were about 10 feet (3.0 m) tall and made of
fireproof brick; forced air was usually provided by hand-operated
bellows.⁵⁵ Modern blast furnaces have grown much bigger.

In 1709, Abraham Darby I established a coke-fired blast furnace to produce
cast iron. The ensuing availability of inexpensive iron was one of the
factors leading to the Industrial Revolution. Toward the end of the 18th
century, cast iron began to replace wrought iron for certain purposes,
because it was cheaper. Carbon content in iron wasn't implicated as the
reason for the differences in properties of wrought iron, cast iron, and
steel until the 18th century.³⁹

Since iron was becoming cheaper and more plentiful, it also became a major
structural material following the building of the innovative first iron
bridge in 1778.

Steel

See also: Steelmaking

Steel (with smaller carbon content than pig iron but more than wrought
iron) was first produced in antiquity by using a bloomery. Blacksmiths in
Luristan in western Iran were making good steel by 1000 BCE.³⁹ Then
improved versions, Wootz steel by India and Damascus steel were developed
around 300 BCE and 500 CE respectively. These methods were specialized, and
so steel did not become a major commodity until the 1850s.⁵⁷

New methods of producing it by carburizing bars of iron in the cementation
process were devised in the 17th century AD. In the Industrial Revolution,
new methods of producing bar iron without charcoal were devised and these
were later applied to produce steel. In the late 1850s, Henry Bessemer
invented a new steelmaking process, involving blowing air through molten
pig iron, to produce mild steel. This made steel much more economical,
thereby leading to wrought iron no longer being produced.⁵⁸

Foundations of modern chemistry

Antoine Lavoisier used the reaction of water steam with metallic iron
inside an incandescent iron tube to produce hydrogen in his experiments
leading to the demonstration of the mass conservation. Anaerobic oxidation
of iron at high temperature can be schematically represented by the
following reactions:

  Fe + H₂O → FeO + H₂
  2 Fe + 3 H₂O → Fe₂O₃ + 3 H₂
  3 Fe + 4 H₂O → Fe₃O₄ + 4 H₂

Production of metallic iron

Industrial routes

See also: Iron ore

The production of iron or steel is a process consisting of two main stages,
unless the desired product is cast iron. In the first stage pig iron is
produced in a blast furnace. Alternatively, it may be directly reduced. The
second stage, pig iron is converted to wrought iron or steel.

For a few limited purposes like electromagnet cores, pure iron is produced
by electrolysis of a ferrous sulfate solution

Blast furnace processing

Main article: Blast furnace

Industrial iron production starts with iron ores, principally hematite,
which has a nominal formula Fe₂O₃, and magnetite, with the formula Fe₃O₄.
These ores are reduced to the metal in a carbothermic reaction, i.e. by
treatment with carbon. The conversion is typically conducted in a blast
furnace at temperatures of about 2000 °C. Carbon is provided in the form of
coke. The process also contains a flux such as limestone, which is used to
remove silicaceous minerals in the ore, which would otherwise clog the
furnace. The coke and limestone are fed into the top of the furnace, while
a massive blast of heated air, about 4 tons per ton of iron,⁵⁵ is forced
into the furnace at the bottom.

In the furnace, the coke reacts with oxygen in the air blast to produce
carbon monoxide:

  2 C + O₂ → 2 CO

The carbon monoxide reduces the iron ore (in the chemical equation below,
hematite) to molten iron, becoming carbon dioxide in the process:

  Fe₂O₃ + 3 CO → 2 Fe + 3 CO₂

Some iron in the high-temperature lower region of the furnace reacts
directly with the coke:

  2 Fe₂O₃ + 3 C → 4 Fe + 3 CO₂

The flux present to melt impurities in the ore is principally limestone
(calcium carbonate) and dolomite (calcium-magnesium carbonate). Other
specialized fluxes are used depending on the details of the ore. In the
heat of the furnace the limestone flux decomposes to calcium oxide (also
known as quicklime):

  CaCO₃ → CaO + CO₂

Then calcium oxide combines with silicon dioxide to form a liquid slag.

  CaO + SiO₂ → CaSiO₃

The slag melts in the heat of the furnace. In the bottom of the furnace,
the molten slag floats on top of the denser molten iron, and apertures in
the side of the furnace are opened to run off the iron and the slag
separately. The iron, once cooled, is called pig iron, while the slag can
be used as a material in road construction or to improve mineral-poor soils
for agriculture⁵⁵

Direct iron reduction

Owing to environmental concerns, alternative methods of processing iron
have been developed. "Direct iron reduction" reduces iron ore to a powder
called "sponge" iron or "direct" iron that is suitable for steelmaking.⁵⁵
Two main reactions comprise the direct reduction process:

Natural gas is partially oxidized (with heat and a catalyst):

  2 CH₄ + O₂ → 2 CO + 4 H₂

These gases are then treated with iron ore in a furnace, producing solid
sponge iron:

  Fe₂O₃ + CO + 2 H₂ → 2 Fe + CO₂ + 2 H₂O

Silica is removed by adding a limestone flux as described above.

Further processes

Main articles: Steelmaking and Ironworks

Pig iron is not pure iron, but has 4–5% carbon dissolved in it with small
amounts of other impurities like sulfur, magnesium, phosphorus and
manganese. As the carbon is the major impurity, the iron (pig iron) becomes
brittle and hard. This form of iron, also known as cast iron, is used to
cast articles in foundries such as stoves, pipes, radiators, lamp-posts and
rails.

Alternatively pig iron may be made into steel (with up to about 2% carbon)
or wrought iron (commercially pure iron). Various processes have been used
for this, including finery forges, puddling furnaces, Bessemer converters,
open hearth furnaces, basic oxygen furnaces, and electric arc furnaces. In
all cases, the objective is to oxidize some or all of the carbon, together
with other impurities. On the other hand, other metals may be added to make
alloy steels.

Annealing involves the heating of a piece of steel to 700–800 °C for
several hours and then gradual cooling. It makes the steel softer and more
workable.

Laboratory methods

Metallic iron is generally produced in the laboratory by two methods. One
route is electrolysis of ferrous chloride onto an iron cathode. The second
method involves reduction of iron oxides with hydrogen gas at about 500
°C.⁵⁹

Applications

Metallurgical

Iron is the most widely used of all the metals, accounting for 95% of
worldwide metal production. Its low cost and high strength make it
indispensable in engineering applications such as the construction of
machinery and machine tools, automobiles, the hulls of large ships, and
structural components for buildings. Since pure iron is quite soft, it is
most commonly combined with alloying elements to make steel.

Commercially available iron is classified based on purity and the abundance
of additives. Pig iron has 3.5–4.5% carbon⁶¹ and contains varying amounts
of contaminants such as sulfur, silicon and phosphorus. Pig iron is not a
saleable product, but rather an intermediate step in the production of cast
iron and steel. The reduction of contaminants in pig iron that negatively
affect material properties, such as sulfur and phosphorus, yields cast iron
containing 2–4% carbon, 1–6% silicon, and small amounts of manganese. It
has a melting point in the range of 1420–1470 K, which is lower than either
of its two main components, and makes it the first product to be melted
when carbon and iron are heated together. Its mechanical properties vary
greatly and depend on the form the carbon takes in the alloy.

"White" cast irons contain their carbon in the form of cementite, or
iron-carbide. This hard, brittle compound dominates the mechanical
properties of white cast irons, rendering them hard, but unresistant to
shock. The broken surface of a white cast iron is full of fine facets of
the broken iron-carbide, a very pale, silvery, shiny material, hence the
appellation.

In gray iron the carbon exists as separate, fine flakes of graphite, and
also renders the material brittle due to the sharp edged flakes of graphite
that produce stress concentration sites within the material. A newer
variant of gray iron, referred to as ductile iron is specially treated with
trace amounts of magnesium to alter the shape of graphite to spheroids, or
nodules, reducing the stress concentrations and vastly increasing the
toughness and strength of the material.

Wrought iron contains less than 0.25% carbon but large amounts of slag that
give it a fibrous characteristic.⁶¹ It is a tough, malleable product, but
not as fusible as pig iron. If honed to an edge, it loses it quickly.
Wrought iron is characterized by the presence of fine fibers of slag
entrapped within the metal. Wrought iron is more corrosion resistant than
steel. It has been almost completely replaced by mild steel for traditional
"wrought iron" products and blacksmithing.

Mild steel corrodes more readily than wrought iron, but is cheaper and more
widely available. Carbon steel contains 2.0% carbon or less,⁶² with small
amounts of manganese, sulfur, phosphorus, and silicon. Alloy steels contain
varying amounts of carbon as well as other metals, such as chromium,
vanadium, molybdenum, nickel, tungsten, etc. Their alloy content raises
their cost, and so they are usually only employed for specialist uses. One
common alloy steel, though, is stainless steel. Recent developments in
ferrous metallurgy have produced a growing range of microalloyed steels,
also termed 'HSLA' or high-strength, low alloy steels, containing tiny
additions to produce high strengths and often spectacular toughness at
minimal cost.

Apart from traditional applications, iron is also used for protection from
ionizing radiation. Although it is lighter than another traditional
protection material, lead, it is much stronger mechanically. The
attenuation of radiation as a function of energy is shown in the graph.

The main disadvantage of iron and steel is that pure iron, and most of its
alloys, suffer badly from rust if not protected in some way. Painting,
galvanization, passivation, plastic coating and bluing are all used to
protect iron from rust by excluding water and oxygen or by cathodic
protection.

Iron compounds

Although its metallurgical role is dominant in terms of amounts, iron
compounds are pervasive in industry as well being used in many niche uses.
Iron catalysts are traditionally used in the Haber-Bosch Process for the
production of ammonia and the Fischer-Tropsch process for conversion of
carbon monoxide to hydrocarbons for fuels and lubricants.⁶³ Powdered iron
in an acidic solvent was used in the Bechamp reduction the reduction of
nitrobenzene to aniline.⁶⁴

Iron(III) chloride finds use in water purification and sewage treatment, in
the dyeing of cloth, as a coloring agent in paints, as an additive in
animal feed, and as an etchant for copper in the manufacture of printed
circuit boards.⁶⁵ It can also be dissolved in alcohol to form tincture of
iron. The other halides tend to be limited to laboratory uses.

Iron(II) sulfate is used as a precursor to other iron compounds. It is also
used to reduce chromate in cement. It is used to fortify foods and treat
iron deficiency anemia. These are its main uses. Iron(III) sulfate is used
in settling minute sewage particles in tank water. Iron(II) chloride is
used as a reducing flocculating agent, in the formation of iron complexes
and magnetic iron oxides, and as a reducing agent in organic synthesis.

Biological role

Iron is abundant in biology.⁶⁶ ⁶⁷ Iron-proteins are found in all living
organisms, ranging from the evolutionarily primitive archaea to humans. The
color of blood is due to the hemoglobin, an iron-containing protein. As
illustrated by hemoglobin, iron is often bound to cofactors, e.g. in hemes.
The iron-sulfur clusters are pervasive and include nitrogenase, the enzymes
responsible for biological nitrogen fixation. Influential theories of
evolution have invoked a role for iron sulfides in the iron-sulfur world
theory.

Iron is a necessary trace element found in nearly all living organisms.
Iron-containing enzymes and proteins, often containing heme prosthetic
groups, participate in many biological oxidations and in transport.
Examples of proteins found in higher organisms include hemoglobin,
cytochrome (see high-valent iron), and catalase.⁶⁸

Bioinorganic compounds

The most commonly known and studied "bioinorganic" compounds of iron (i.e.,
iron compounds used in biology) are the heme proteins: examples are
hemoglobin, myoglobin, and cytochrome P450. These compounds can transport
gases, build enzymes, and be used in transferring electrons.
Metalloproteins are a group of proteins with metal ion cofactors. Some
examples of iron metalloproteins are ferritin and rubredoxin. Many enzymes
vital to life contain iron, such as catalase, lipoxygenases, and IRE-BP.

Health and diet

Main articles: Iron deficiency and Human iron metabolism

Iron is pervasive, but particularly rich sources of dietary iron include
red meat, lentils, beans, poultry, fish, leaf vegetables, watercress, tofu,
chickpeas, black-eyed peas, blackstrap molasses, fortified bread, and
fortified breakfast cereals. Iron in low amounts is found in molasses,
teff, and farina. Iron in meat (heme iron) is more easily absorbed than
iron in vegetables.⁶⁹ Although some studies suggest that heme/hemoglobin
from red meat has effects which may increase the likelihood of colorectal
cancer,⁷⁰ ⁷¹ there is still some controversy,⁷² and even a few studies
suggesting that there is not enough evidence to support such claims.⁷³

Iron provided by dietary supplements is often found as iron(II) fumarate,
although iron sulfate is cheaper and is absorbed equally well. Elemental
iron, or reduced iron, despite being absorbed at only one third to two
thirds the efficiency (relative to iron sulfate),⁷⁴ is often added to foods
such as breakfast cereals or enriched wheat flour. Iron is most available
to the body when chelated to amino acids⁷⁵ and is also available for use as
a common iron supplement. Often the amino acid chosen for this purpose is
the cheapest and most common amino acid, glycine, leading to "iron
glycinate" supplements.⁷⁶ The Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for iron
varies considerably based on age, gender, and source of dietary iron
(heme-based iron has higher bioavailability).⁷⁷ Infants may require iron
supplements if they are bottle-fed cow's milk.⁷⁸ Blood donors and pregnant
women are at special risk of low iron levels and are often advised to
supplement their iron intake.⁷⁹

Uptake and storage

Iron acquisition poses a problem for aerobic organisms, because ferric iron
is poorly soluble near neutral pH. Thus, bacteria have evolved
high-affinity sequestering agents called siderophores.⁸⁰ ⁸¹ ⁸²

After uptake, in cells, iron storage is carefully regulated; "free" iron
ions do not exist as such. A major component of this regulation is the
protein transferrin, which binds iron ions absorbed from the duodenum and
carries it in the blood to cells.⁸³ In animals, plants, and fungi, iron is
often the metal ion incorporated into the heme complex. Heme is an
essential component of cytochrome proteins, which mediate redox reactions,
and of oxygen carrier proteins such as hemoglobin, myoglobin, and
leghemoglobin.

Inorganic iron contributes to redox reactions in the iron-sulfur clusters
of many enzymes, such as nitrogenase (involved in the synthesis of ammonia
from nitrogen and hydrogen) and hydrogenase. Non-heme iron proteins include
the enzymes methane monooxygenase (oxidizes methane to methanol),
ribonucleotide reductase (reduces ribose to deoxyribose; DNA biosynthesis),
hemerythrins (oxygen transport and fixation in marine invertebrates) and
purple acid phosphatase (hydrolysis of phosphate esters).

Iron distribution is heavily regulated in mammals, partly because iron ions
have a high potential for biological toxicity.⁸⁴

Regulation of uptake

Main article: Hepcidin

Iron uptake is tightly regulated by the human body, which has no regulated
physiological means of excreting iron. Only small amounts of iron are lost
daily due to mucosal and skin epithelial cell sloughing, so control of iron
levels is mostly by regulating uptake.⁸⁵ Regulation of iron uptake is
impaired in some people as a result of a genetic defect that maps to the
HLA-H gene region on chromosome 6. In these people, excessive iron intake
can result in iron overload disorders, such as hemochromatosis. Many people
have a genetic susceptibility to iron overload without realizing it or
being aware of a family history of the problem. For this reason, it is
advised that people do not take iron supplements unless they suffer from
iron deficiency and have consulted a doctor. Hemochromatosis is estimated
to cause disease in between 0.3 and 0.8% of Caucasians.⁸⁶

MRI finds that iron accumulates in the hippocampus of the brains of those
with Alzheimer's disease and in the substantia nigra of those with
Parkinson disease.⁸⁷

Bioremediation

Iron-eating bacteria live in the hulls of sunken ships such as the
Titanic.⁸⁸ The acidophile bacteria Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans,
Leptospirillum ferrooxidans, Sulfolobus spp., Acidianus brierleyi and
Sulfobacillus thermosulfidooxidans can oxidize ferrous iron enzymically.⁸⁹
A sample of the fungus Aspergillus niger was found growing from gold mining
solution, and was found to contain cyano metal complexes such as gold,
silver, copper iron and zinc. The fungus also plays a role in the
solubilization of heavy metal sulfides.⁹⁰

Permeable reactive barriers

Zerovalent iron is the main reactive material for permeable reactive
barriers.⁹¹

Toxicity

Main article: Iron poisoning

Large amounts of ingested iron can cause excessive levels of iron in the
blood. High blood levels of free ferrous iron react with peroxides to
produce free radicals, which are highly reactive and can damage DNA,
proteins, lipids, and other cellular components. Thus, iron toxicity occurs
when there is free iron in the cell, which generally occurs when iron
levels exceed the capacity of transferrin to bind the iron. Damage to the
cells of the gastrointestinal tract can also prevent them from regulating
iron absorption leading to further increases in blood levels. Iron
typically damages cells in the heart, liver and elsewhere, which can cause
significant adverse effects, including coma, metabolic acidosis, shock,
liver failure, coagulopathy, adult respiratory distress syndrome, long-term
organ damage, and even death.⁹² Humans experience iron toxicity above 20
milligrams of iron for every kilogram of mass, and 60 milligrams per
kilogram is considered a lethal dose.⁹³ Overconsumption of iron, often the
result of children eating large quantities of ferrous sulfate tablets
intended for adult consumption, is one of the most common toxicological
causes of death in children under six.⁹³ The Dietary Reference Intake (DRI)
lists the Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) for adults as 45 mg/day. For
children under fourteen years old the UL is 40 mg/day.

The medical management of iron toxicity is complicated, and can include use
of a specific chelating agent called deferoxamine to bind and expel excess
iron from the body.⁹² ⁹⁴ ⁹⁵

Magnetic field

For other uses, see Magnetic field (disambiguation).

A magnetic field is the magnetic effect of electric currents and magnetic
materials. The magnetic field at any given point is specified by both a
direction and a magnitude (or strength); as such it is a vector field.[nb
1] The term is used for two distinct but closely related fields denoted by
the symbols B and H, where H is measured in units of amperes per meter
(symbol: A·m−1 or A/m) in the SI. B is measured in teslas (symbol:T) and
newtons per meter per ampere (symbol: N·m−1·A−1 or N/(m·A)) in the SI. B is
most commonly defined in terms of the Lorentz force it exerts on moving
electric charges.

Magnetic fields can be produced by moving electric charges and the
intrinsic magnetic moments of elementary particles associated with a
fundamental quantum property, their spin.¹ ² In special relativity,
electric and magnetic fields are two interrelated aspects of a single
object, called the electromagnetic tensor; the split of this tensor into
electric and magnetic fields depends on the relative velocity of the
observer and charge. In quantum physics, the electromagnetic field is
quantized and electromagnetic interactions result from the exchange of
photons.

In everyday life, magnetic fields are most often encountered as a force
created by permanent magnets, which pull on ferromagnetic materials such as
iron, cobalt, or nickel, and attract or repel other magnets. Magnetic
fields are widely used throughout modern technology, particularly in
electrical engineering and electromechanics. The Earth produces its own
magnetic field, which is important in navigation, and it shields the
Earth's atmosphere from solar wind. Rotating magnetic fields are used in
both electric motors and generators. Magnetic forces give information about
the charge carriers in a material through the Hall effect. The interaction
of magnetic fields in electric devices such as transformers is studied in
the discipline of magnetic circuits.

History

Main article: History of electromagnetic theory

Although magnets and magnetism were known much earlier, the study of
magnetic fields began in 1269 when French scholar Petrus Peregrinus de
Maricourt mapped out the magnetic field on the surface of a spherical
magnet using iron needles.[nb 2] Noting that the resulting field lines
crossed at two points he named those points 'poles' in analogy to Earth's
poles. He also clearly articulated the principle that magnets always have
both a north and south pole, no matter how finely one slices them.

Almost three centuries later, William Gilbert of Colchester replicated
Petrus Peregrinus' work and was the first to state explicitly that Earth is
a magnet.³ Published in 1600, Gilbert's work, De Magnete, helped to
establish magnetism as a science.

In 1750, John Michell stated that magnetic poles attract and repel in
accordance with an inverse square law.⁴ Charles-Augustin de Coulomb
experimentally verified this in 1785 and stated explicitly that the north
and south poles cannot be separated.⁵ Building on this force between poles,
Siméon Denis Poisson (1781–1840) created the first successful model of the
magnetic field, which he presented in 1824.⁶ In this model, a magnetic
H-field is produced by 'magnetic poles' and magnetism is due to small pairs
of north/south magnetic poles.

Three discoveries challenged this foundation of magnetism, though. First,
in 1819, Hans Christian Oersted discovered that an electric current
generates a magnetic field encircling it. Then in 1820, André-Marie Ampère
showed that parallel wires having currents in the same direction attract
one another. Finally, Jean-Baptiste Biot and Félix Savart discovered the
Biot–Savart law in 1820, which correctly predicts the magnetic field around
any current-carrying wire.

Extending these experiments, Ampère published his own successful model of
magnetism in 1825. In it, he showed the equivalence of electrical currents
to magnets⁷ and proposed that magnetism is due to perpetually flowing loops
of current instead of the dipoles of magnetic charge in Poisson's model.[nb
3] This has the additional benefit of explaining why magnetic charge can
not be isolated. Further, Ampère derived both Ampère's force law describing
the force between two currents and Ampère's law, which, like the
Biot–Savart law, correctly described the magnetic field generated by a
steady current. Also in this work, Ampère introduced the term
electrodynamics to describe the relationship between electricity and
magnetism.

In 1831, Michael Faraday discovered electromagnetic induction when he found
that a changing magnetic field generates an encircling electric field. He
described this phenomenon in what is known as Faraday's law of induction.
Later, Franz Ernst Neumann proved that, for a moving conductor in a
magnetic field, induction is a consequence of Ampère's force law.⁸ In the
process he introduced the magnetic vector potential, which was later shown
to be equivalent to the underlying mechanism proposed by Faraday.

In 1850, Lord Kelvin, then known as William Thomson, distinguished between
two magnetic fields now denoted H and B. The former applied to Poisson's
model and the latter to Ampère's model and induction.⁹ Further, he derived
how H and B relate to each other.

The reason H and B are used for the two magnetic fields has been a source
of some debate among science historians. Most agree that Kelvin avoided M
to prevent confusion with the SI fundamental unit of length, the Metre,
abbreviated "m." However, some believe that Kelvin chose H to honor his
mentor Humphry Davy and chose B because he and his wife never had children,
and Kelvin strongly desired that his wife have a baby, and the word "baby"
begins with "B." Others believe the choices were purely random.¹⁰ ¹¹

Between 1861 and 1865, James Clerk Maxwell developed and published
Maxwell's equations, which explained and united all of classical
electricity and magnetism. The first set of these equations was published
in a paper entitled On Physical Lines of Force in 1861. These equations
were valid although incomplete. Maxwell completed his set of equations in
his later 1865 paper A Dynamical Theory of the Electromagnetic Field and
demonstrated the fact that light is an electromagnetic wave. Heinrich Hertz
experimentally confirmed this fact in 1887.

The twentieth century extended electrodynamics to include relativity and
quantum mechanics. Albert Einstein, in his paper of 1905 that established
relativity, showed that both the electric and magnetic fields are part of
the same phenomena viewed from different reference frames. (See moving
magnet and conductor problem for details about the thought experiment that
eventually helped Albert Einstein to develop special relativity.) Finally,
the emergent field of quantum mechanics was merged with electrodynamics to
form quantum electrodynamics (QED).

Definitions, units, and measurement

The B-field

The magnetic field can be defined in several equivalent ways based on the
effects it has on its environment.

Often the magnetic field is defined by the force it exerts on a moving
charged particle. It is known from experiments in electrostatics that a
particle of charge q in an electric field E experiences a force F = qE.
However, in other situations, such as when a charged particle moves in the
vicinity of a current-carrying wire, the force also depends on the velocity
of that particle. Fortunately, the velocity dependent portion can be
separated out such that the force on the particle satisfies the Lorentz
force law,

F = q(E + v \times B).

Here v is the particle's velocity and × denotes the cross product. The
vector B is termed the magnetic field, and it is defined as the vector
field necessary to make the Lorentz force law correctly describe the motion
of a charged particle. This definition allows the determination of B in the
following way¹⁴

  [T]he command, "Measure the direction and magnitude of the vector B at
  such and such a place," calls for the following operations: Take a
  particle of known charge q. Measure the force on q at rest, to determine
  E. Then measure the force on the particle when its velocity is v; repeat
  with v in some other direction. Now find a B that makes [the Lorentz
  force law] fit all these results—that is the magnetic field at the place
  in question.

Alternatively, the magnetic field can be defined in terms of the torque it
produces on a magnetic dipole (see magnetic torque on permanent magnets
below).

The H-field

In addition to B, there is a quantity H, which is also sometimes called the
magnetic field.[nb 4] In a vacuum, B and H are proportional to each other,
with the multiplicative constant depending on the physical units. Inside a
material they are different (see H and B inside and outside of magnetic
materials). The term "magnetic field" is historically reserved for H while
using other terms for B. Informally, though, and formally for some recent
textbooks mostly in physics, the term 'magnetic field' is used to describe
B as well as or in place of H.[nb 5]There are many alternative names for
both (see sidebar).

Units

In SI units, B is measured in teslas (symbol: T) and correspondingly ΦB
(magnetic flux) is measured in webers (symbol: Wb) so that a flux density
of 1 Wb/m² is 1 tesla. The SI unit of tesla is equivalent to
(newton·second)/(coulomb·metre).[nb 6] In Gaussian-cgs units, B is measured
in gauss (symbol: G). (The conversion is 1 T = 10,000 G.) The H-field is
measured in amperes per metre (A/m) in SI units, and in oersteds (Oe) in
cgs units.¹⁵

Measurement

The precision attained for a magnetic field measurement for Gravity Probe B
experiment is 5 attoteslas (5×10−18 T);¹⁶ the largest magnetic field
produced in a laboratory is 2.8 kT (VNIIEF in Sarov, Russia, 1998).¹⁷ The
magnetic field of some astronomical objects such as magnetars are much
higher; magnetars range from 0.1 to 100 GT (10⁸ to 10¹¹ T).¹⁸ See orders of
magnitude (magnetic field).

Devices used to measure the local magnetic field are called magnetometers.
Important classes of magnetometers include using a rotating coil, Hall
effect magnetometers, NMR magnetometers, SQUID magnetometers, and fluxgate
magnetometers. The magnetic fields of distant astronomical objects are
measured through their effects on local charged particles. For instance,
electrons spiraling around a field line produce synchrotron radiation that
is detectable in radio waves.

Magnetic field lines

Main article: Field line

Mapping the magnetic field of an object is simple in principle. First,
measure the strength and direction of the magnetic field at a large number
of locations (or at every point in space). Then, mark each location with an
arrow (called a vector) pointing in the direction of the local magnetic
field with its magnitude proportional to the strength of the magnetic
field.

An alternative method to map the magnetic field is to 'connect' the arrows
to form magnetic field lines. The direction of the magnetic field at any
point is parallel to the direction of nearby field lines, and the local
density of field lines can be made proportional to its strength.

Magnetic field lines are like the contour lines (constant altitude) on a
topographic map in that they represent something continuous, and a
different mapping scale would show more or fewer lines. An advantage of
using magnetic field lines as a representation is that many laws of
magnetism (and electromagnetism) can be stated completely and concisely
using simple concepts such as the 'number' of field lines through a
surface. These concepts can be quickly 'translated' to their mathematical
form. For example, the number of field lines through a given surface is the
surface integral of the magnetic field.

Various phenomena have the effect of "displaying" magnetic field lines as
though the field lines are physical phenomena. For example, iron filings
placed in a magnetic field line up to form lines that correspond to 'field
lines'.[nb 7] Magnetic fields' "lines" are also visually displayed in polar
auroras, in which plasma particle dipole interactions create visible
streaks of light that line up with the local direction of Earth's magnetic
field.

Field lines can be used as a qualitative tool to visualize magnetic forces.
In ferromagnetic substances like iron and in plasmas, magnetic forces can
be understood by imagining that the field lines exert a tension, (like a
rubber band) along their length, and a pressure perpendicular to their
length on neighboring field lines. 'Unlike' poles of magnets attract
because they are linked by many field lines; 'like' poles repel because
their field lines do not meet, but run parallel, pushing on each other. The
rigorous form of this concept is the electromagnetic stress–energy tensor.

Magnetic field and permanent magnets

Main article: Magnet

Permanent magnets are objects that produce their own persistent magnetic
fields. They are made of ferromagnetic materials, such as iron and nickel,
that have been magnetized, and they have both a north and a south pole.

Magnetic field of permanent magnets

Main articles: Magnetic moment and Two definitions of moment

The magnetic field of permanent magnets can be quite complicated,
especially near the magnet. The magnetic field of a small[nb 8] straight
magnet is proportional to the magnet's strength (called its magnetic dipole
moment m). The equations are non-trivial and also depend on the distance
from the magnet and the orientation of the magnet. For simple magnets, m
points in the direction of a line drawn from the south to the north pole of
the magnet. Flipping a bar magnet is equivalent to rotating its m by 180
degrees.

The magnetic field of larger magnets can be obtained by modelling them as a
collection of a large number of small magnets called dipoles each having
their own m. The magnetic field produced by the magnet then is the net
magnetic field of these dipoles. And, any net force on the magnet is a
result of adding up the forces on the individual dipoles.

There are two competing models for the nature of these dipoles. These two
models produce two different magnetic fields, H and B. Outside a material,
though, the two are identical (to a multiplicative constant) so that in
many cases the distinction can be ignored. This is particularly true for
magnetic fields, such as those due to electric currents, that are not
generated by magnetic materials.

Magnetic pole model and the H-field

It is sometimes useful to model the force and torques between two magnets
as due to magnetic poles repelling or attracting each other in the same
manner as the Coulomb force between electric charges. This is called the
Gilbert model of magnetism, after William Gilbert. In this model, a
magnetic H-field is produced by magnetic charges that are 'smeared' around
each pole. These magnetic charges are in fact related to the magnetization
field M.

The H-field, therefore, is analogous to the electric field E, which starts
at a positive electric charge and ends at a negative electric charge. Near
the north pole, therefore, all H-field lines point away from the north pole
(whether inside the magnet or out) while near the south pole (whether
inside the magnet or out) all H-field lines point toward the south pole. A
north pole, then, feels a force in the direction of the H-field while the
force on the south pole is opposite to the H-field.

In the magnetic pole model, the elementary magnetic dipole m is formed by
two opposite magnetic poles of pole strength qₘ separated by a small
distance vector d, such that m = qₘ d. The magnetic pole model predicts
correctly the field H both inside and outside magnetic materials, in
particular the fact that H is opposite to the magnetization field M inside
a permanent magnet.

Since it is based on the fictitious idea of a magnetic charge density, the
Gilbert model has limitations. Magnetic poles cannot exist apart from each
other as electric charges can, but always come in north/south pairs. If a
magnetized object is divided in half, a new pole appears on the surface of
each piece, so each has a pair of complementary poles. The magnetic pole
model does not account for magnetism that is produced by electric currents.

Amperian loop model and the B-field

See also: Gauss's law for magnetism

After Oersted discovered that electric currents produce a magnetic field
and Ampere discovered that electric currents attracted and repelled each
other similar to magnets, it was natural to hypothesize that all magnetic
fields are due to electric current loops. In this model developed by
Ampere, the elementary magnetic dipole that makes up all magnets is a
sufficiently small Amperian loop of current I. The dipole moment of this
loop is m = IA where A is the area of the loop.

These magnetic dipoles produce a magnetic B-field. One important property
of the B-field produced this way is that magnetic B-field lines neither
start nor end (mathematically, B is a solenoidal vector field); a field
line either extends to infinity or wraps around to form a closed curve.[nb
9] To date no exception to this rule has been found. (See magnetic monopole
below.) Magnetic field lines exit a magnet near its north pole and enter
near its south pole, but inside the magnet B-field lines continue through
the magnet from the south pole back to the north.[nb 10] If a B-field line
enters a magnet somewhere it has to leave somewhere else; it is not allowed
to have an end point. Magnetic poles, therefore, always come in N and S
pairs.

More formally, since all the magnetic field lines that enter any given
region must also leave that region, subtracting the 'number'[nb 11] of
field lines that enter the region from the number that exit gives
identically zero. Mathematically this is equivalent to:

\oint _S B ·\mathrm{d} A = 0,

where the integral is a surface integral over the closed surface S (a
closed surface is one that completely surrounds a region with no holes to
let any field lines escape). Since dA points outward, the dot product in
the integral is positive for B-field pointing out and negative for B-field
pointing in.

There is also a corresponding differential form of this equation covered in
Maxwell's equations below.

Force between magnets

Main article: Force between magnets

The force between two small magnets is quite complicated and depends on the
strength and orientation of both magnets and the distance and direction of
the magnets relative to each other. The force is particularly sensitive to
rotations of the magnets due to magnetic torque. The force on each magnet
depends on its magnetic moment and the magnetic field[nb 12] of the other.

To understand the force between magnets, it is useful to examine the
magnetic pole model given above. In this model, the H-field of one magnet
pushes and pulls on both poles of a second magnet. If this H-field is the
same at both poles of the second magnet then there is no net force on that
magnet since the force is opposite for opposite poles. If, however, the
magnetic field of the first magnet is nonuniform (such as the H near one of
its poles), each pole of the second magnet sees a different field and is
subject to a different force. This difference in the two forces moves the
magnet in the direction of increasing magnetic field and may also cause a
net torque.

This is a specific example of a general rule that magnets are attracted (or
repulsed depending on the orientation of the magnet) into regions of higher
magnetic field. Any non-uniform magnetic field, whether caused by permanent
magnets or electric currents, exerts a force on a small magnet in this way.

The details of the Amperian loop model are different and more complicated
but yield the same result: that magnetic dipoles are attracted/repelled
into regions of higher magnetic field. Mathematically, the force on a small
magnet having a magnetic moment m due to a magnetic field B is:¹⁹

F = \nabla \left (m·B\right ),

where the gradient ∇ is the change of the quantity m · B per unit distance
and the direction is that of maximum increase of m · B. To understand this
equation, note that the dot product m · B = mBcos(θ), where m and B
represent the magnitude of the m and B vectors and θ is the angle between
them. If m is in the same direction as B then the dot product is positive
and the gradient points 'uphill' pulling the magnet into regions of higher
B-field (more strictly larger m · B). This equation is strictly only valid
for magnets of zero size, but is often a good approximation for not too
large magnets. The magnetic force on larger magnets is determined by
dividing them into smaller regions each having their own m then summing up
the forces on each of these very small regions.

Magnetic torque on permanent magnets

Main article: Magnetic torque

If two like poles of two separate magnets are brought near each other, and
one of the magnets is allowed to turn, it promptly rotates to align itself
with the first. In this example, the magnetic field of the stationary
magnet creates a magnetic torque on the magnet that is free to rotate. This
magnetic torque τ tends to align a magnet's poles with the magnetic field
lines. A compass, therefore, turns to align itself with Earth's magnetic
field.

Magnetic torque is used to drive electric motors. In one simple motor
design, a magnet is fixed to a freely rotating shaft and subjected to a
magnetic field from an array of electromagnets. By continuously switching
the electric current through each of the electromagnets, thereby flipping
the polarity of their magnetic fields, like poles are kept next to the
rotor; the resultant torque is transferred to the shaft. See Rotating
magnetic fields below.

As is the case for the force between magnets, the magnetic pole model leads
more readily to the correct equation. Here, two equal and opposite magnetic
charges experiencing the same H also experience equal and opposite forces.
Since these equal and opposite forces are in different locations, this
produces a torque proportional to the distance (perpendicular to the force)
between them. With the definition of m as the pole strength times the
distance between the poles, this leads to τ = μ₀mHsinθ, where μ₀ is a
constant called the vacuum permeability, measuring 4π×10−7 V·s/(A·m) and θ
is the angle between H and m.

The Amperian loop model also predicts the same magnetic torque. Here, it is
the B field interacting with the Amperian current loop through a Lorentz
force described below. Again, the results are the same although the models
are completely different.

Mathematically, the torque τ on a small magnet is proportional both to the
applied magnetic field and to the magnetic moment m of the magnet:

\boldsymbol{τ} =m\times B = μ_0m\times H,

where × represents the vector cross product. Note that this equation
includes all of the qualitative information included above. There is no
torque on a magnet if m is in the same direction as the magnetic field.
(The cross product is zero for two vectors that are in the same direction.)
Further, all other orientations feel a torque that twists them toward the
direction of magnetic field.

Magnetic field and electric currents

Currents of electric charges both generate a magnetic field and feel a
force due to magnetic B-fields.

Magnetic field due to moving charges and electric currents

Main articles: Electromagnet, Biot–Savart law and Ampère's law

All moving charged particles produce magnetic fields. Moving point charges,
such as electrons, produce complicated but well known magnetic fields that
depend on the charge, velocity, and acceleration of the particles.²⁰

Magnetic field lines form in concentric circles around a cylindrical
current-carrying conductor, such as a length of wire. The direction of such
a magnetic field can be determined by using the "right hand grip rule" (see
figure at right). The strength of the magnetic field decreases with
distance from the wire. (For an infinite length wire the strength is
inversely proportional to the distance.)

Bending a current-carrying wire into a loop concentrates the magnetic field
inside the loop while weakening it outside. Bending a wire into multiple
closely spaced loops to form a coil or "solenoid" enhances this effect. A
device so formed around an iron core may act as an electromagnet,
generating a strong, well-controlled magnetic field. An infinitely long
cylindrical electromagnet has a uniform magnetic field inside, and no
magnetic field outside. A finite length electromagnet produces a magnetic
field that looks similar to that produced by a uniform permanent magnet,
with its strength and polarity determined by the current flowing through
the coil.

The magnetic field generated by a steady current I (a constant flow of
electric charges, in which charge neither accumulates nor is depleted at
any point)[nb 13] is described by the Biot–Savart law:

B = \frac{μ₀I}{4π} ∫_{\mathrm{wire} }\frac{d\boldsymbol{\ell } \times \hat
r}{r²} ,

where the integral sums over the wire length where vector dℓ is the vector
line element with direction in the same sense as the current I, μ₀ is the
magnetic constant, r is the distance between the location of dℓ and the
location where the magnetic field is calculated, and r̂ is a unit vector in
the direction of r.

A slightly more general²¹ [nb 14] way of relating the current {I} to the
B-field is through Ampère's law:

\oint B ·d\boldsymbol{\ell } = μ_0 I_{\mathrm{enc} },

where the line integral is over any arbitrary loop and {I}enc is the
current enclosed by that loop. Ampère's law is always valid for steady
currents and can be used to calculate the B-field for certain highly
symmetric situations such as an infinite wire or an infinite solenoid.

In a modified form that accounts for time varying electric fields, Ampère's
law is one of four Maxwell's equations that describe electricity and
magnetism.

Force on moving charges and current

Force on a charged particle

Main article: Lorentz force

A charged particle moving in a B-field experiences a sideways force that is
proportional to the strength of the magnetic field, the component of the
velocity that is perpendicular to the magnetic field and the charge of the
particle. This force is known as the Lorentz force, and is given by

F = q v \times B,

whereF is the force, q is the electric charge of the particle, v is the
instantaneous velocity of the particle, and B is the magnetic field (in
teslas).

The Lorentz force is always perpendicular to both the velocity of the
particle and the magnetic field that created it. When a charged particle
moves in a static magnetic field, it traces a helical path in which the
helix axis is parallel to the magnetic field, and in which the speed of the
particle remains constant. Because the magnetic force is always
perpendicular to the motion, the magnetic field can do no work on an
isolated charge. It can only do work indirectly, via the electric field
generated by a changing magnetic field. It is often claimed that the
magnetic force can do work to a non-elementary magnetic dipole, or to
charged particles whose motion is constrained by other forces, but this is
incorrect²² because the work in those cases is performed by the electric
forces of the charges deflected by the magnetic field.

Force on current-carrying wire

Main article: Laplace force

The force on a current carrying wire is similar to that of a moving charge
as expected since a charge carrying wire is a collection of moving charges.
A current-carrying wire feels a force in the presence of a magnetic field.
The Lorentz force on a macroscopic current is often referred to as the
Laplace force. Consider a conductor of length ℓ, cross section A, and
charge q due to electric current i. If this conductor is placed in a
magnetic field of magnitude B that makes an angle θ with the velocity of
charges in the conductor, the force exerted on a single charge q is

F = qvB \sin θ,

so, for N charges where

N = n \ell A

the force exerted on the conductor is

f=FN=qvB n\ell A \sin θ= Bi\ell \sin θ

where i = nqvA.

Direction of force

See also: Right-hand rule

The direction of force on a charge or a current can be determined by a
mnemonic known as the right-hand rule (see the figure). Using the right
hand and pointing the thumb in the direction of the moving positive charge
or positive current and the fingers in the direction of the magnetic field
the resulting force on the charge points outwards from the palm. The force
on a negatively charged particle is in the opposite direction. If both the
speed and the charge are reversed then the direction of the force remains
the same. For that reason a magnetic field measurement (by itself) cannot
distinguish whether there is a positive charge moving to the right or a
negative charge moving to the left. (Both of these cases produce the same
current.) On the other hand, a magnetic field combined with an electric
field can distinguish between these, see Hall effect below.

An alternative mnemonic to the right hand rule Flemings's left hand rule.

Relation between H and B

The formulas derived for the magnetic field above are correct when dealing
with the entire current. A magnetic material placed inside a magnetic
field, though, generates its own bound current, which can be a challenge to
calculate. (This bound current is due to the sum of atomic sized current
loops and the spin of the subatomic particles such as electrons that make
up the material.) The H-field as defined above helps factor out this bound
current; but to see how, it helps to introduce the concept of magnetization
first.

Magnetization

Main article: Magnetization

The magnetization vector field M represents how strongly a region of
material is magnetized. It is defined as the net magnetic dipole moment per
unit volume of that region. The magnetization of a uniform magnet is
therefore a material constant, equal to the magnetic moment m of the magnet
divided by its volume. Since the SI unit of magnetic moment is A·m², the SI
unit of magnetization M is ampere per meter, identical to that of the
H-field.

The magnetization M field of a region points in the direction of the
average magnetic dipole moment in that region. Magnetization field lines,
therefore, begin near the magnetic south pole and ends near the magnetic
north pole. (Magnetization does not exist outside of the magnet.)

In the Amperian loop model, the magnetization is due to combining many tiny
Amperian loops to form a resultant current called bound current. This bound
current, then, is the source of the magnetic B field due to the magnet.
(See Magnetic dipoles below and magnetic poles vs. atomic currents for more
information.) Given the definition of the magnetic dipole, the
magnetization field follows a similar law to that of Ampere's law:²³

\oint M ·d\boldsymbol{\ell } = I_{\mathrm{b} },

where the integral is a line integral over any closed loop and Ib is the
'bound current' enclosed by that closed loop.

In the magnetic pole model, magnetization begins at and ends at magnetic
poles. If a given region, therefore, has a net positive 'magnetic pole
strength' (corresponding to a north pole) then it has more magnetization
field lines entering it than leaving it. Mathematically this is equivalent
to:

\oint _S μ_0 M ·\mathrm{d} A = -q_M

where the integral is a closed surface integral over the closed surface S
and qM is the 'magnetic charge' (in units of magnetic flux) enclosed by S.
(A closed surface completely surrounds a region with no holes to let any
field lines escape.) The negative sign occurs because the magnetization
field moves from south to north.

H-field and magnetic materials

See also: demagnetizing field

The H-field is defined as:

  H ≡ \frac{B}{μ₀} -M,(definition of H in SI units)

With this definition, Ampere's law becomes:

\oint H ·d\boldsymbol{\ell } = \oint \left (\frac{B}{μ₀} - M\right )
·d\boldsymbol{\ell } = I_{\mathrm{tot} }- I_{\mathrm{b} } = I_{\mathrm{f}
},

where If represents the 'free current' enclosed by the loop so that the
line integral of H does not depend at all on the bound currents.²⁴ For the
differential equivalent of this equation see Maxwell's equations. Ampere's
law leads to the boundary condition

(H_1^\parallel - H_2^\parallel ) = K_f \times \hat{n} ,

where Kf is the surface free current density and the unit normal \hat{n}
points in the direction from medium 2 to medium 1.²⁵

Similarly, a surface integral of H over any closed surface is independent
of the free currents and picks out the 'magnetic charges' within that
closed surface:

\oint _S μ_0 H ·\mathrm{d} A = \oint _S (B- μ_0 M)·\mathrm{d} A= (0 -
(-q_M)) = q_M,

which does not depend on the free currents.

The H-field, therefore, can be separated into two[nb 15] independent parts:

H = H_0 + H_d,

where H₀ is the applied magnetic field due only to the free currents and Hd
is the demagnetizing field due only to the bound currents.

The magnetic H-field, therefore, re-factors the bound current in terms of
'magnetic charges'. The H field lines loop only around 'free current' and,
unlike the magnetic B field, begins and ends near magnetic poles as well.

Magnetism

Main article: Magnetism

Most materials respond to an applied B-field by producing their own
magnetization M and therefore their own B-field. Typically, the response is
weak and exists only when the magnetic field is applied. The term magnetism
describes how materials respond on the microscopic level to an applied
magnetic field and is used to categorize the magnetic phase of a material.
Materials are divided into groups based upon their magnetic behavior:

- Diamagnetic materials²⁶ produce a magnetization that opposes the magnetic
  field.
- Paramagnetic materials²⁶ produce a magnetization in the same direction as
  the applied magnetic field.
- Ferromagnetic materials and the closely related ferrimagnetic materials
  and antiferromagnetic materials²⁷ ²⁸ can have a magnetization independent
  of an applied B-field with a complex relationship between the two fields.
- Superconductors (and ferromagnetic superconductors)²⁹ ³⁰ are materials
  that are characterized by perfect conductivity below a critical
  temperature and magnetic field. They also are highly magnetic and can be
  perfect diamagnets below a lower critical magnetic field. Superconductors
  often have a broad range of temperatures and magnetic fields (the so
  named mixed state) under which they exhibit a complex hysteretic
  dependence of M on B.

In the case of paramagnetism and diamagnetism, the magnetization M is often
proportional to the applied magnetic field such that:

B = μH,

where μ is a material dependent parameter called the permeability. In some
cases the permeability may be a second rank tensor so that H may not point
in the same direction as B. These relations between B and H are examples of
constitutive equations. However, superconductors and ferromagnets have a
more complex B to H relation; see magnetic hysteresis.

Energy stored in magnetic fields

Main article: Magnetic energy
See also: Magnetic hysteresis

Energy is needed to generate a magnetic field both to work against the
electric field that a changing magnetic field creates and to change the
magnetization of any material within the magnetic field. For non-dispersive
materials this same energy is released when the magnetic field is destroyed
so that this energy can be modeled as being stored in the magnetic field.

For linear, non-dispersive, materials (such that B = μH where μ is
frequency-independent), the energy density is:

u = \frac{B·H}{2} = \frac{B·B}{2μ} = \frac{μH·H}{2} .

If there are no magnetic materials around then μ can be replaced by μ₀. The
above equation cannot be used for nonlinear materials, though; a more
general expression given below must be used.

In general, the incremental amount of work per unit volume δW needed to
cause a small change of magnetic field δB is:

δW = H·δB.

Once the relationship between H and B is known this equation is used to
determine the work needed to reach a given magnetic state. For hysteretic
materials such as ferromagnets and superconductors, the work needed also
depends on how the magnetic field is created. For linear non-dispersive
materials, though, the general equation leads directly to the simpler
energy density equation given above.

Electromagnetism: the relationship between magnetic and electric fields

Main article: Electromagnetism

Faraday's Law: Electric force due to a changing B-field

Main articles: Faraday's law and Magnetic flux

A changing magnetic field, such as a magnet moving through a conducting
coil, generates an electric field (and therefore tends to drive a current
in such a coil). This is known as Faraday's law and forms the basis of many
electrical generators and electric motors.

Mathematically, Faraday's law is:

\mathcal{E} = - \frac{dΦ_\mathrm{m} }{dt} ,

where \mathcal{E} is the electromotive force (or EMF, the voltage generated
around a closed loop) and Φₘ is the magnetic flux—the product of the area
times the magnetic field normal to that area. (This definition of magnetic
flux is why B is often referred to as magnetic flux density.)

The negative sign represents the fact that any current generated by a
changing magnetic field in a coil produces a magnetic field that opposes
the change in the magnetic field that induced it. This phenomenon is known
as Lenz's law.

This integral formulation of Faraday's law can be converted[nb 16] into a
differential form, which applies under slightly different conditions. This
form is covered as one of Maxwell's equations below.

Maxwell's correction to Ampère's Law: The magnetic field due to a changing
electric field

Main article: Maxwell's correction to Ampère's law

Similar to the way that a changing magnetic field generates an electric
field, a changing electric field generates a magnetic field. This fact is
known as Maxwell's correction to Ampère's law. Maxwell's correction to
Ampère's Law bootstrap together with Faraday's law of induction to form
electromagnetic waves, such as light. Thus, a changing electric field
generates a changing magnetic field, which generates a changing electric
field again.

Maxwell's correction to Ampère law is applied as an additive term to
Ampere's law given above. This additive term is proportional to the time
rate of change of the electric flux and is similar to Faraday's law above
but with a different and positive constant out front. (The electric flux
through an area is proportional to the area times the perpendicular part of
the electric field.)

This full Ampère law including the correction term is known as the
Maxwell–Ampère equation. It is not commonly given in integral form because
the effect is so small that it can typically be ignored in most cases where
the integral form is used. The Maxwell term is critically important in the
creation and propagation of electromagnetic waves. These, though, are
usually described using the differential form of this equation given below.

Maxwell's equations

Main article: Maxwell's equations

Like all vector fields, a magnetic field has two important mathematical
properties that relates it to its sources. (For B the sources are currents
and changing electric fields.) These two properties, along with the two
corresponding properties of the electric field, make up Maxwell's
Equations. Maxwell's Equations together with the Lorentz force law form a
complete description of classical electrodynamics including both
electricity and magnetism.

The first property is the divergence of a vector field A, ∇ · A, which
represents how A 'flows' outward from a given point. As discussed above, a
B-field line never starts or ends at a point but instead forms a complete
loop. This is mathematically equivalent to saying that the divergence of B
is zero. (Such vector fields are called solenoidal vector fields.) This
property is called Gauss's law for magnetism and is equivalent to the
statement that there are no isolated magnetic poles or magnetic monopoles.
The electric field on the other hand begins and ends at electric charges so
that its divergence is non-zero and proportional to the charge density (See
Gauss's law).

The second mathematical property is called the curl, such that ∇ × A
represents how A curls or 'circulates' around a given point. The result of
the curl is called a 'circulation source'. The equations for the curl of B
and of E are called the Ampère–Maxwell equation and Faraday's law
respectively. They represent the differential forms of the integral
equations given above.

The complete set of Maxwell's equations then are:

\nabla ·B = 0,
\nabla ·E = \frac{ρ}{ϵ₀} ,
\nabla \times B = μ_0J + μ_0 ε_0 \frac{\partial E}{\partial t} ,
\nabla \times E = - \frac{\partial B}{\partial t} ,

where J = complete microscopic current density and ρ is the charge density.

Technically, B is a pseudovector (also called an axial vector) due to being
defined by a vector cross product. (See diagram.)

As discussed above, materials respond to an applied electric E field and an
applied magnetic B field by producing their own internal 'bound' charge and
current distributions that contribute to E and B but are difficult to
calculate. To circumvent this problem, H and D fields are used to re-factor
Maxwell's equations in terms of the free current density Jf and free charge
density ρf:

\nabla ·B = 0,
\nabla ·D = ρ_\mathrm{f} ,
\nabla \times H = J_\mathrm{f} + \frac{\partial D}{\partial t} ,
\nabla \times E = - \frac{\partial B}{\partial t} .

These equations are not any more general than the original equations (if
the 'bound' charges and currents in the material are known). They also must
be supplemented by the relationship between B and H as well as that between
E and D. On the other hand, for simple relationships between these
quantities this form of Maxwell's equations can circumvent the need to
calculate the bound charges and currents.

Electric and magnetic fields: different aspects of the same phenomenon

Main article: Relativistic electromagnetism

According to the special theory of relativity, the partition of the
electromagnetic force into separate electric and magnetic components is not
fundamental, but varies with the observational frame of reference: An
electric force perceived by one observer may be perceived by another (in a
different frame of reference) as a magnetic force, or a mixture of electric
and magnetic forces.

Formally, special relativity combines the electric and magnetic fields into
a rank-2 tensor, called the electromagnetic tensor. Changing reference
frames mixes these components. This is analogous to the way that special
relativity mixes space and time into spacetime, and mass, momentum and
energy into four-momentum.³¹

Magnetic vector potential

Main article: Magnetic potential

In advanced topics such as quantum mechanics and relativity it is often
easier to work with a potential formulation of electrodynamics rather than
in terms of the electric and magnetic fields. In this representation, the
vector potential A, and the scalar potential φ, are defined such that:

B = \nabla \times A,
E = - \nabla φ- \frac { \partial A } { \partial t }.

The vector potential A may be interpreted as a generalized potential
momentum per unit charge³² just as φ is interpreted as a generalized
potential energy per unit charge.

Maxwell's equations when expressed in terms of the potentials can be cast
into a form that agrees with special relativity with little effort.³³ In
relativity A together with φ forms the four-potential, analogous to the
four-momentum that combines the momentum and energy of a particle. Using
the four potential instead of the electromagnetic tensor has the advantage
of being much simpler—and it can be easily modified to work with quantum
mechanics.

Quantum electrodynamics

See also: Standard Model and quantum electrodynamics

In modern physics, the electromagnetic field is understood to be not a
classical field, but rather a quantum field; it is represented not as a
vector of three numbers at each point, but as a vector of three quantum
operators at each point. The most accurate modern description of the
electromagnetic interaction (and much else) is quantum electrodynamics
(QED),³⁴ which is incorporated into a more complete theory known as the
Standard Model of particle physics.

In QED, the magnitude of the electromagnetic interactions between charged
particles (and their antiparticles) is computed using perturbation theory.
These rather complex formulas produce a remarkable pictorial representation
as Feynman diagrams in which virtual photons are exchanged.

Predictions of QED agree with experiments to an extremely high degree of
accuracy: currently about 10−12 (and limited by experimental errors); for
details see precision tests of QED. This makes QED one of the most accurate
physical theories constructed thus far.

All equations in this article are in the classical approximation, which is
less accurate than the quantum description mentioned here. However, under
most everyday circumstances, the difference between the two theories is
negligible.

Important uses and examples of magnetic field

Earth's magnetic field

Main article: Earth's magnetic field

The Earth's magnetic field is thought to be produced by convection currents
in the outer liquid of Earth's core. The Dynamo theory proposes that these
movements produce electric currents that, in turn, produce the magnetic
field.³⁵

The presence of this field causes a compass, placed anywhere within it, to
rotate so that the "north pole" of the magnet in the compass points roughly
north, toward Earth's North Magnetic Pole. This is the traditional
definition of the "north pole" of a magnet, although other equivalent
definitions are also possible.

One confusion that arises from this definition is that, if Earth itself is
considered as a magnet, the south pole of that magnet would be the one
nearer the north magnetic pole, and vice versa. The north magnetic pole is
so-named not because of the polarity of the field there but because of its
geographical location. The north and south poles of a permanent magnet are
so-called because they are "north-seeking" and "south-seeking",
respectively.³⁶ ³⁷

The figure is a sketch of Earth's magnetic field represented by field
lines. For most locations, the magnetic field has a significant up/down
component in addition to the north/south component. (There is also an
east/west component, as Earth's magnetic and geographical poles do not
coincide.) The magnetic field can be visualised as a bar magnet buried deep
in Earth's interior.

Earth's magnetic field is not constant—the strength of the field and the
location of its poles vary. Moreover, the poles periodically reverse their
orientation in a process called geomagnetic reversal. The most recent
reversal occurred 780,000 years ago.

Rotating magnetic fields

Main articles: Rotating magnetic field and Alternator

The rotating magnetic field is a key principle in the operation of
alternating-current motors. A permanent magnet in such a field rotates so
as to maintain its alignment with the external field. This effect was
conceptualized by Nikola Tesla, and later utilized in his, and others',
early AC (alternating current) electric motors.

A rotating magnetic field can be constructed using two orthogonal coils
with 90 degrees phase difference in their AC currents. However, in practice
such a system would be supplied through a three-wire arrangement with
unequal currents.

This inequality would cause serious problems in standardization of the
conductor size and so, to overcome it, three-phase systems are used where
the three currents are equal in magnitude and have 120 degrees phase
difference. Three similar coils having mutual geometrical angles of 120
degrees create the rotating magnetic field in this case. The ability of the
three-phase system to create a rotating field, utilized in electric motors,
is one of the main reasons why three-phase systems dominate the world's
electrical power supply systems.

Synchronous motors use DC-voltage-fed rotor windings, which lets the
excitation of the machine be controlled—and induction motors use
short-circuited rotors (instead of a magnet) following the rotating
magnetic field of a multicoiled stator. The short-circuited turns of the
rotor develop eddy currents in the rotating field of the stator, and these
currents in turn move the rotor by the Lorentz force.

In 1882, Nikola Tesla identified the concept of the rotating magnetic
field. In 1885, Galileo Ferraris independently researched the concept. In
1888, Tesla gained U.S. Patent 381,968 for his work. Also in 1888, Ferraris
published his research in a paper to the Royal Academy of Sciences in
Turin.

Hall effect

Main article: Hall effect

The charge carriers of a current carrying conductor placed in a transverse
magnetic field experience a sideways Lorentz force; this results in a
charge separation in a direction perpendicular to the current and to the
magnetic field. The resultant voltage in that direction is proportional to
the applied magnetic field. This is known as the Hall effect.

The Hall effect is often used to measure the magnitude of a magnetic field.
It is used as well to find the sign of the dominant charge carriers in
materials such as semiconductors (negative electrons or positive holes).

Magnetic circuits

Main article: Magnetic circuit

An important use of H is in magnetic circuits where B = μH inside a linear
material. Here, μ is the magnetic permeability of the material. This result
is similar in form to Ohm's law J = σE, where J is the current density, σ
is the conductance and E is the electric field. Extending this analogy, the
counterpart to the macroscopic Ohm's law (I = V⁄R) is:

Φ= \frac F R_\mathrm{m} ,

where Φ= ∫B·dA is the magnetic flux in the circuit, F =
∫H·d\boldsymbol{\ell } is the magnetomotive force applied to the circuit,
and Rₘ is the reluctance of the circuit. Here the reluctance Rₘ is a
quantity similar in nature to resistance for the flux.

Using this analogy it is straightforward to calculate the magnetic flux of
complicated magnetic field geometries, by using all the available
techniques of circuit theory.

Magnetic field shape descriptions

- An azimuthal magnetic field is one that runs east–west.
- A meridional magnetic field is one that runs north–south. In the solar
  dynamo model of the Sun, differential rotation of the solar plasma causes
  the meridional magnetic field to stretch into an azimuthal magnetic
  field, a process called the omega-effect. The reverse process is called
  the alpha-effect.³⁸
- A dipole magnetic field is one seen around a bar magnet or around a
  charged elementary particle with nonzero spin.
- A quadrupole magnetic field is one seen, for example, between the poles
  of four bar magnets. The field strength grows linearly with the radial
  distance from its longitudinal axis.
- A solenoidal magnetic field is similar to a dipole magnetic field, except
  that a solid bar magnet is replaced by a hollow electromagnetic coil
  magnet.
- A toroidal magnetic field occurs in a doughnut-shaped coil, the electric
  current spiraling around the tube-like surface, and is found, for
  example, in a tokamak.
- A poloidal magnetic field is generated by a current flowing in a ring,
  and is found, for example, in a tokamak.
- A radial magnetic field is one in which field lines are directed from the
  center outwards, similar to the spokes in a bicycle wheel. An example can
  be found in a loudspeaker transducers (driver).³⁹
- A helical magnetic field is corkscrew-shaped, and sometimes seen in space
  plasmas such as the Orion Molecular Cloud.⁴⁰

Magnetic dipoles

Main article: Magnetic dipole
See also: Spin magnetic moment and Micromagnetism

The magnetic field of a magnetic dipole is depicted in the figure. From
outside, the ideal magnetic dipole is identical to that of an ideal
electric dipole of the same strength. Unlike the electric dipole, a
magnetic dipole is properly modeled as a current loop having a current I
and an area a. Such a current loop has a magnetic moment of:

m=Ia,

where the direction of m is perpendicular to the area of the loop and
depends on the direction of the current using the right-hand rule. An ideal
magnetic dipole is modeled as a real magnetic dipole whose area a has been
reduced to zero and its current I increased to infinity such that the
product m = Ia is finite. This model clarifies the connection between
angular momentum and magnetic moment, which is the basis of the Einstein–de
Haas effect rotation by magnetization and its inverse, the Barnett effect
or magnetization by rotation.⁴¹ Rotating the loop faster (in the same
direction) increases the current and therefore the magnetic moment, for
example.

It is sometimes useful to model the magnetic dipole similar to the electric
dipole with two equal but opposite magnetic charges (one south the other
north) separated by distance d. This model produces an H-field not a
B-field. Such a model is deficient, though, both in that there are no
magnetic charges and in that it obscures the link between electricity and
magnetism. Further, as discussed above it fails to explain the inherent
connection between angular momentum and magnetism.

Magnetic monopole (hypothetical)

Main article: Magnetic monopole

A magnetic monopole is a hypothetical particle (or class of particles) that
has, as its name suggests, only one magnetic pole (either a north pole or a
south pole). In other words, it would possess a "magnetic charge" analogous
to an electric charge. Magnetic field lines would start or end on magnetic
monopoles, so if they exist, they would give exceptions to the rule that
magnetic field lines neither start nor end.

Modern interest in this concept stems from particle theories, notably Grand
Unified Theories and superstring theories, that predict either the
existence, or the possibility, of magnetic monopoles. These theories and
others have inspired extensive efforts to search for monopoles. Despite
these efforts, no magnetic monopole has been observed to date.[nb 17]

In recent research, materials known as spin ices can simulate monopoles,
but do not contain actual monopoles.⁴² ⁴³

Notes

[1] Strictly speaking, a magnetic field is a pseudo vector; pseudo-vectors,
  which also include torque and rotational velocity, are similar to vectors
  except that they remain unchanged when the coordinates are inverted.
[2] His Epistola Petri Peregrini de Maricourt ad Sygerum de Foucaucourt
  Militem de Magnete, which is often shortened to Epistola de magnete, is
  dated 1269 C.E.
[3] From the outside, the field of a dipole of magnetic charge has exactly
  the same form as a current loop when both are sufficiently small.
  Therefore, the two models differ only for magnetism inside magnetic
  material.
[4] The letters B and H were originally chosen by Maxwell in his Treatise
  on Electricity and Magnetism (Vol. II, pp. 236–237). For many quantities,
  he simply started choosing letters from the beginning of the alphabet.
  See Baierlein, Ralph (2000). "Answer to Question #73. S is for entropy, Q
  is for charge". American Journal of Physics 68 (8): 691.
  Bibcode:2000AmJPh..68..691B. doi:10.1119/1.19524.
[5] Edward Purcell, in Electricity and Magnetism, McGraw-Hill, 1963,
  writes, Even some modern writers who treat B as the primary field feel
  obliged to call it the magnetic induction because the name magnetic field
  was historically preempted by H. This seems clumsy and pedantic. If you
  go into the laboratory and ask a physicist what causes the pion
  trajectories in his bubble chamber to curve, he'll probably answer
  "magnetic field", not "magnetic induction." You will seldom hear a
  geophysicist refer to the Earth's magnetic induction, or an
  astrophysicist talk about the magnetic induction of the galaxy. We
  propose to keep on calling B the magnetic field. As for H, although other
  names have been invented for it, we shall call it "the field H" or even
  "the magnetic field H." In a similar vein, M Gerloch (1983). Magnetism
  and Ligand-field Analysis. Cambridge University Press. p. 110. ISBN
  0-521-24939-2. says: "So we may think of both B and H as magnetic fields,
  but drop the word 'magnetic' from H so as to maintain the distinction ...
  As Purcell points out, 'it is only the names that give trouble, not the
  symbols'."
[6] This can be seen from the magnetic part of the Lorentz force law F =
  qvBsinθ.
[7] The use of iron filings to display a field presents something of an
  exception to this picture; the filings alter the magnetic field so that
  it is much larger along the "lines" of iron, due to the large
  permeability of iron relative to air.
[8] Here 'small' means that the observer is sufficiently far away that it
  can be treated as being infinitesimally small. 'Larger' magnets need to
  include more complicated terms in the expression and depend on the entire
  geometry of the magnet not just m.
[9] Magnetic field lines may also wrap around and around without closing
  but also without ending. These more complicated non-closing non-ending
  magnetic field lines are moot, though, since the magnetic field of
  objects that produce them are calculated by adding the magnetic fields of
  'elementary parts' having magnetic field lines that do form closed curves
  or extend to infinity.
[10] To see that this must be true imagine placing a compass inside a
  magnet. There, the north pole of the compass points toward the north pole
  of the magnet since magnets stacked on each other point in the same
  direction.
[11] As discussed above, magnetic field lines are primarily a conceptual
  tool used to represent the mathematics behind magnetic fields. The total
  'number' of field lines is dependent on how the field lines are drawn. In
  practice, integral equations such as the one that follows in the main
  text are used instead.
[12] Either B or H may be used for the magnetic field outside of the
  magnet.
[13] In practice, the Biot–Savart law and other laws of magnetostatics are
  often used even when a current change in time, as long as it does not
  change too quickly. It is often used, for instance, for standard
  household currents, which oscillate sixty times per second.
[14] The Biot–Savart law contains the additional restriction (boundary
  condition) that the B-field must go to zero fast enough at infinity. It
  also depends on the divergence of B being zero, which is always valid.
  (There are no magnetic charges.)
[15] A third term is needed for changing electric fields and polarization
  currents; this displacement current term is covered in Maxwell's
  equations below.
[16] A complete expression for Faraday's law of induction in terms of the
  electric E and magnetic fields can be written as:\textstyle \mathcal{E} =
  - \frac{dΦₘ}{dt}  \textstyle = \oint _{\partial Σ(t)}\left ( E( r, t) + v
  \times B(r, t)\right ) ·d\boldsymbol{\ell }  \textstyle =-\frac {d} {dt}
  \iint _{Σ(t)} d \boldsymbol {A} ·{B}(r, t), where ∂Σ(t) is the moving
  closed path bounding the moving surface Σ(t), and dA is an element of
  surface area of Σ(t). The first integral calculates the work done moving
  a charge a distance dℓ based upon the Lorentz force law. In the case
  where the bounding surface is stationary, the Kelvin–Stokes theorem can
  be used to show this equation is equivalent to the Maxwell–Faraday
  equation.
[17] Two experiments produced candidate events that were initially
  interpreted as monopoles, but these are now considered inconclusive. For
  details and references, see magnetic monopole.

Metallicity

In astronomy and physical cosmology, the metallicity or Z, is the fraction
of mass of a star or other kind of astronomical object, beyond hydrogen (X)
and helium (Y).¹ ² Most of the physical matter in the universe is in the
form of hydrogen and helium, so astronomers conveniently use the blanket
term "metals" to refer to all other elements.³ For example, stars or
nebulae that are relatively rich in carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and neon
would be "metal-rich" in astrophysical terms, even though those elements
are non-metals in chemistry. This term should not be confused with the
usual physical definition of solid metals.

Metallicity within stars and other astronomical objects is an approximate
estimation of their chemical abundances that change over time by the
mechanisms of stellar evolution,⁴ and therefore provide an indication of
their age.⁵ In cosmological terms, the universe is also chemically
evolving. According to the Big Bang Theory, the early universe first
consisted of hydrogen and helium, with trace amounts of lithium and
beryllium, but no heavier elements. Through the process of stellar
evolution, where stars at the end of their lives discard most of their mass
by stellar winds or explode as supernovae, the metal content of the Galaxy
and the universe increases.⁶ It is postulated that older generations of
stars generally have lower metallicities than those of younger
generations.⁷

Observed changes in the chemical abundances of different types of stars,
based on the spectral peculiarities that were later attributed to
metallicity, led astronomer Walter Baade in 1944 to propose the existence
of two different populations of stars.⁸ These became commonly known as
Population I and Population II stars. A third stellar population was
introduced in 1978, known as Population III stars.⁹ ¹⁰ ¹¹ These extremely
metal-poor stars were theorised to have been the 'first-born' stars created
in the universe.

Definition

Stellar composition, as determined by spectroscopy, is usually simply
defined by the parameters X, Y and Z. Here X is the fractional percentage
of hydrogen, Y is the fractional percentage of helium, and all the
remaining chemical elements as the fractional percentage, Z. It is simply
defined as;

X + Y + Z = 1.00

In most stars, nebulae and other astronomical sources, hydrogen and helium
are the two dominant elements. The hydrogen mass fraction is generally
expressed as X≡\frac{m_\mathrm{H} }{M} where M is the total mass of the
system and m_\mathrm{H} the fractional mass of the hydrogen it contains.
Similarly, the helium mass fraction is denoted as Y≡\frac{m_\mathrm{He}
}{M} . The remainder of the elements are collectively referred to as
'metals', and the metallicity—the mass fraction of elements heavier than
helium—can be calculated as

Z = Σ_{i>\mathrm{He} } \frac{m_i}{M} = 1 - X - Y.

For the Sun, these parameters are often assumed to have the following
approximate values,¹² although recent research shows that lower values for
Z_\mathrm{sun} might be more appropriate:¹³ ¹⁴

The metallicity of many astronomical objects cannot be measured directly.
Instead, proxies are used to obtain an indirect estimate. For example, an
observer might measure the iron content of a galaxy (for example using the
brightness of an iron emission line) directly, then compare that value with
models to estimate the total metallicity.

Calculation

The metallicity is often expressed as "[Fe/H]", which represents the
logarithm of the ratio of a star's iron abundance compared to that of the
Sun (iron is not the most abundant heavy element, but it is among the
easiest to measure with spectral data in the visible spectrum). The formula
for the logarithm is expressed thus:

[\mathrm{Fe} /\mathrm{H} ] = \log _{10}{\left (\frac{N_{\mathrm{Fe}
}}{N_{\mathrm{H} }} \right )_\mathrm{star} } - \log _{10}{\left
(\frac{N_{\mathrm{Fe} }}{N_{\mathrm{H} }} \right )_\mathrm{sun} }

where N_{\mathrm{Fe} } and N_{\mathrm{H} } are the number of iron and
hydrogen atoms per unit of volume respectively. The unit often used for
metallicity is the "dex" which is a (now-deprecated) contraction of
'decimal exponent'.¹⁵ By this formulation, stars with a higher metallicity
than the Sun have a positive logarithmic value, whereas those with a lower
metallicity than the Sun have a negative value. The logarithm is based on
powers of 10; stars with a value of +1 have ten times the metallicity of
the Sun (10¹). Conversely, those with a value of −1 have one-tenth (10−1),
while those with a value of −2 have a hundredth (10−2), and so on.³ Young
Population I stars have significantly higher iron-to-hydrogen ratios than
older Population II stars. Primordial Population III stars are estimated to
have a metallicity of less than −6.0, that is, less than a millionth of the
abundance of iron in the Sun.

The same sort of notation is used to express differences in the individual
elements from the solar proportion. For example, the notation "[O/Fe]"
represents the difference in the logarithm of the star's oxygen abundance
compared to that of the Sun and the logarithm of the star's iron abundance
compared to the Sun:

[\mathrm{O} /\mathrm{Fe} ] = \log _{10}{\left (\frac{N_{\mathrm{O}
}}{N_{\mathrm{Fe} }} \right )_\mathrm{star} } - \log _{10}{\left
(\frac{N_{\mathrm{O} }}{N_{\mathrm{Fe} }} \right )_\mathrm{sun} }
= \left{\log _{10}{\left (\frac{N_{\mathrm{O} }}{N_{\mathrm{H} }} \right
)_\mathrm{star} } - \log _{10}{\left (\frac{N_{\mathrm{O} }}{N_{\mathrm{H}
}} \right )_\mathrm{sun} }\right } - \left{\log _{10}{\left
(\frac{N_{\mathrm{Fe} }}{N_{\mathrm{H} }} \right )_\mathrm{star} } - \log
_{10}{\left (\frac{N_{\mathrm{Fe} }}{N_{\mathrm{H} }} \right )_\mathrm{sun}
}\right } .

The point of this notation is that if a mass of gas is diluted with pure
hydrogen, then its [Fe/H] value will decrease (because there are fewer iron
atoms per hydrogen atom after the dilution), but for all other elements X,
the [X/Fe] ratios will remain unchanged. By contrast, if a mass of gas is
polluted with some amount of pure oxygen, then its [Fe/H] will remain
unchanged but its [O/Fe] ratio will increase. In general, a given stellar
nucleosynthetic process alters the proportions of only a few elements or
isotopes, so a star or gas sample with nonzero [X/Fe] values may be showing
the signature of particular nuclear processes.

Relation between Z and [Fe/H]

These two ways of expressing the metallic content of a star are related
through the equation:

\log _{10}\left (\frac{Z/X}{Z_\mathrm{sun} /X_\mathrm{sun} } \right ) =
[\mathrm{M} /\mathrm{H} ]

where [M/H] is the star's total metal abundance (i.e. all elements heavier
than helium) defined as a more general expression than the one for [Fe/H]:

[\mathrm{M} /\mathrm{H} ] = \log _{10}{\left (\frac{N_{\mathrm{M}
}}{N_{\mathrm{H} }} \right )_\mathrm{star} } - \log _{10}{\left
(\frac{N_{\mathrm{M} }}{N_{\mathrm{H} }} \right )_\mathrm{sun} } .

The iron abundance and the total metal abundance are often assumed to be
related through a constant A as:

[\mathrm{M} /\mathrm{H} ] = A*[\mathrm{Fe} /\mathrm{H} ]

where A assumes values between 0.9 and 1. Using the formulas presented
above, the relation between Z and [Fe/H] can finally be written as:

\log _{10}\left (\frac{Z/X}{Z_\mathrm{sun} /X_\mathrm{sun} } \right ) =
A*[\mathrm{Fe} /\mathrm{H} ].

Its name "milky" is derived from its appearance as a dim glowing band
arching across the night sky whose individual stars cannot be distinguished
by the naked eye. The term "Milky Way" is a translation of the Latin via
lactea, from the Greek γαλαξίας κύκλος (galaxías kýklos, "milky circle").²¹
²² ²³ From Earth the Milky Way appears as a band because its disk-shaped
structure is viewed from within. Galileo Galilei first resolved the band of
light into individual stars with his telescope in 1610. Until the early
1920s most astronomers thought that the Milky Way contained all the stars
in the Universe. Following the 1920 Great Debate between the astronomers
Harlow Shapley and Heber Curtis,²⁴ observations by Edwin Hubble showed that
the Milky Way is just one of many galaxies—now known to number in the
billions.²⁵

The Milky Way is a barred spiral galaxy that has a diameter usually
considered to be roughly 100,000–120,000 light-years²⁶ but may be
150,000–180,000 light-years.²⁷ The Milky Way is estimated to contain
100–400 billion stars,²⁸ although this number may be as high as one
trillion.²⁹ There are probably at least 100 billion planets in the Milky
Way.³⁰ ³¹ The Solar System is located within the disk, about 27,000
light-years from the Galactic Center, on the inner edge of one of the
spiral-shaped concentrations of gas and dust called the Orion Arm. The
stars in the inner ≈10,000 light-years form a bulge and one or more bars
that radiate from the bulge. The very center is marked by an intense radio
source, named Sagittarius A*, which is likely to be a supermassive black
hole.

Stars and gases at a wide range of distances from the Galactic Center orbit
at approximately 220 kilometers per second. The constant rotation speed
contradicts the laws of Keplerian dynamics and suggests that much of the
mass of the Milky Way does not emit or absorb electromagnetic radiation.
This mass has been given the name "dark matter".³² The rotational period is
about 240 million years at the position of the Sun.¹⁵ The Milky Way as a
whole is moving at a velocity of approximately 600 km per second with
respect to extragalactic frames of reference. The oldest stars in the Milky
Way are nearly as old as the Universe itself and thus must have formed
shortly after the Big Bang.⁹

The Milky Way has several satellite galaxies and is part of the Local Group
of galaxies, which is a component of the Virgo Supercluster, which again is
a component of the Laniakea Supercluster.³³ ³⁴

Appearance

The "Milky Way" can be seen as a hazy band of white light some 30 degrees
wide arcing across the sky.³⁵ Although all the individual naked-eye stars
in the entire sky are part of the Milky Way,³⁶ the light in this band
originates from the accumulation of unresolved stars and other material
located in the direction of the galactic plane. Dark regions within the
band, such as the Great Rift and the Coalsack, are areas where light from
distant stars is blocked by interstellar dust. The area of the sky obscured
by the Milky Way is called the Zone of Avoidance.

The Milky Way has a relatively low surface brightness. Its visibility can
be greatly reduced by background light such as light pollution or stray
light from the Moon. The sky needs to be darker than about 20.2 magnitude
per square arcsecond in order for the Milky Way to be seen.³⁷ It should be
visible when the limiting magnitude is approximately +5.1 or better and
shows a great deal of detail at +6.1.³⁸ This makes the Milky Way difficult
to see from any brightly lit urban or suburban location, but very prominent
when viewed from a rural area when the Moon is below the horizon.[nb 2]

As viewed from Earth, the visible region of the Milky Way's Galactic plane
occupies an area of the sky that includes 30 constellations. The center of
the Milky Way lies in the direction of the constellation Sagittarius; it is
here that the Milky Way is brightest. From Sagittarius, the hazy band of
white light appears to pass westward to the Galactic anticenter in Auriga.
The band then continues westward the rest of the way around the sky, back
to Sagittarius. The band divides the night sky into two roughly equal
hemispheres.

The Galactic plane is inclined by about 60 degrees to the ecliptic (the
plane of Earth's orbit). Relative to the celestial equator, it passes as
far north as the constellation of Cassiopeia and as far south as the
constellation of Crux, indicating the high inclination of Earth's
equatorial plane and the plane of the ecliptic, relative to the Galactic
plane. The north Galactic pole is situated at right ascension 12h 49m,
declination +27.4° (B1950) near β Comae Berenices, and the south Galactic
pole is near α Sculptoris. Because of this high inclination, depending on
the time of night and year, the arc of Milky Way may appear relatively low
or relatively high in the sky. For observers from approximately 65 degrees
north to 65 degrees south on Earth's surface, the Milky Way passes directly
overhead twice a day.

Size and mass

The Milky Way is the second-largest galaxy in the Local Group, with its
stellar disk approximately 100,000 ly (30 kpc) in diameter, and, on
average, approximately 1,000 ly (0.3 kpc) thick.⁴ ⁵ As a guide to the
relative physical scale of the Milky Way, if the Solar System out to
Neptune were the size of a US quarter (25mm), the Milky Way would be
approximately the size of the United States.⁴⁰ A ring-like filament of
stars wrapping around the Milky Way may actually belong to the Milky Way
itself, rippling above and below the relatively flat galactic plane.²⁷ If
so, that would mean a diameter of 150,000–180,000 light-years (46–55
kpc).⁴¹

Estimates of the mass of the Milky Way vary, depending upon the method and
data used. At the low end of the estimate range, the mass of the Milky Way
is 5.8×10¹¹ solar masses (M☉), somewhat less than that of the Andromeda
Galaxy.⁴² ⁴³ ⁴⁴ Measurements using the Very Long Baseline Array in 2009
found velocities as large as 254 km/s for stars at the outer edge of the
Milky Way.⁴⁵ Because the orbital velocity depends on the total mass inside
the orbital radius, this suggests that the Milky Way is more massive,
roughly equaling the mass of Andromeda Galaxy at 7×10¹¹ M☉ within 160,000
ly (49 kpc) of its center.⁴⁶ In 2010, a measurement of the radial velocity
of halo stars finds that the mass enclosed within 80 kiloparsecs is 7×10¹¹
M☉.⁴⁷ According to a study published in 2014, the mass of the entire Milky
Way is estimated to be 8.5×10¹¹ M☉,⁴⁸ which is about half the mass of the
Andromeda Galaxy.⁴⁸

Most of the mass of the Milky Way appears to be dark matter, an unknown and
invisible form of matter that interacts gravitationally with ordinary
matter. A dark matter halo is spread out relatively uniformly to a distance
beyond one hundred kiloparsecs from the Galactic Center. Mathematical
models of the Milky Way suggest that its total mass is 1–1.5×10¹² M☉.¹⁰
More-recent studies indicate a mass as large as 4.5×10¹² M☉ ⁴⁹ and as small
as 0.8×10¹² M☉.⁵⁰

The total mass of all the stars in the Milky Way is estimated to be between
4.6×10¹⁰ M☉⁵¹ and 6.43×10¹⁰ M☉.¹⁰ In addition to that mass in stars,
there's between 10%⁵² and 15%⁵³ of it in the form of gas (90% of hydrogen
and 10% of helium by mass,⁵³ with two thirds of the former in atomic form
and the remaining one third in molecular form⁵² ), as well as an 1% of the
total gas mass in the form of interstellar dust.⁵³

Further information: Exoplanet

The Milky Way contains between 200 and 400 billion stars⁵⁴ ⁵⁵ and at least
100 billion planets.⁵⁶ The exact figure depends on the number of very low
mass, or dwarf stars, which are hard to detect, especially at distances of
more than 300 ly (90 pc) from the Sun. As a comparison, the neighboring
Andromeda Galaxy contains an estimated one trillion (10¹²) stars.⁵⁷ Filling
the space between the stars is a disk of gas and dust called the
interstellar medium. This disk has at least a comparable extent in radius
to the stars,⁵⁸ whereas the thickness of the gas layer ranges from hundreds
of light years for the colder gas to thousands of light years for warmer
gas.⁵⁹ ⁶⁰

The disk of stars in the Milky Way does not have a sharp edge beyond which
there are no stars. Rather, the concentration of stars decreases with
distance from the center of the Milky Way. For reasons that are not
understood, beyond a radius of roughly 40,000 ly (13 kpc) from the center,
the number of stars per cubic parsec drops much faster with radius.⁶¹
Surrounding the galactic disk is a spherical Galactic Halo of stars and
globular clusters that extends further outward but is limited in size by
the orbits of two Milky Way satellites, the Large and Small Magellanic
Clouds, whose closest approach to the Galactic Center is about 180,000 ly
(55 kpc).⁶² At this distance or beyond, the orbits of most halo objects
would be disrupted by the Magellanic Clouds. Hence, such objects would
probably be ejected from the vicinity of the Milky Way. The integrated
absolute visual magnitude of the Milky Way is estimated to be around
−20.9.⁶³ ⁶⁴ [lower-alpha 1]

Both gravitational microlensing and planetary transit observations indicate
that there may be at least as many planets bound to stars as there are
stars in the Milky Way,³⁰ ⁶⁵ and microlensing measurements indicate that
there are more rogue planets not bound to host stars than there are
stars.⁶⁶ ⁶⁷ The Milky Way contains at least one planet per star, resulting
in 100–400 billion planets, according to a January 2013 study of the
five-planet star system Kepler-32 with the Kepler space observatory.³¹ A
different January 2013 analysis of Kepler data estimated that at least 17
billion Earth-sized exoplanets reside in the Milky Way.⁶⁸ On November 4,
2013, astronomers reported, based on Kepler space mission data, that there
could be as many as 40 billion Earth-sized planets orbiting in the
habitable zones of Sun-like stars and red dwarfs within the Milky Way.⁶⁹ ⁷⁰
⁷¹ 11 billion of these estimated planets may be orbiting Sun-like stars.⁷²
The nearest such planet may be 12 light-years away, according to
scientists.⁶⁹ ⁷⁰ Such Earth-sized planets may be more numerous than gas
giants.³⁰ Besides exoplanets, "exocomets", comets beyond the Solar System,
have also been detected and may be common in the Milky Way.⁶⁸

Structure

Artist's conception of the spiral structure of the Milky Way with two major
stellar arms and a bar⁷³
Spitzer reveals what cannot be seen in visible light: cooler stars (blue),
heated dust (reddish hue), and Sgr A* as bright white spot in the middle.
Bright X-ray flares from Sagittarius A*, location of the supermassive black
hole at the center of the Milky Way.⁷⁴

The Milky Way consists of a bar-shaped core region surrounded by a disk of
gas, dust and stars. The gas, dust and stars are organized in roughly
logarithmic spiral arm structures (see Spiral arms below). The mass
distribution within the Milky Way closely resembles the type SBc in the
Hubble classification, which represents spiral galaxies with relatively
loosely wound arms.¹ Astronomers first began to suspect that the Milky Way
is a barred spiral galaxy, rather than an ordinary spiral galaxy, in the
1990s.⁷⁵ Their suspicions were confirmed by the Spitzer Space Telescope
observations in 2005⁷⁶ that showed the Milky Way's central bar to be larger
than previously thought.

Galactic quadrants

Main article: Galactic quadrant

A galactic quadrant, or quadrant of the Milky Way, refers to one of four
circular sectors in the division of the Milky Way. In actual astronomical
practice, the delineation of the galactic quadrants is based upon the
galactic coordinate system, which places the Sun as the origin of the
mapping system.⁷⁷

Quadrants are described using ordinals—for example, "1st galactic
quadrant",⁷⁸ "second galactic quadrant",⁷⁹ or "third quadrant of the Milky
Way".⁸⁰ Viewing from the north galactic pole with 0 degrees (°) as the ray
that runs starting from the Sun and through the Galactic Center, the
quadrants are as follows:

- 1st galactic quadrant – 0° ≤ longitude (ℓ) ≤ 90°⁸¹
- 2nd galactic quadrant – 90° ≤ ℓ ≤ 180°⁷⁹
- 3rd galactic quadrant – 180° ≤ ℓ ≤ 270°⁸⁰
- 4th galactic quadrant – 270° ≤ ℓ ≤ 360° (0°)⁷⁸

Galactic Center

Main article: Galactic Center

The Sun is 26,000–28,000 ly (8.0–8.6 kpc) from the Galactic Center. This
value is estimated using geometric-based methods or by measuring selected
astronomical objects that serve as standard candles, with different
techniques yielding various values within this approximate range.¹⁴ ⁸² ⁸³
⁸⁴ ⁸⁵ In the inner few kpc (around 10,000 light-years radius) is a dense
concentration of mostly old stars in a roughly spheroidal shape called the
bulge.⁸⁶ It has been proposed that the Milky Way lacks a bulge formed due
to a collision and merger between previous galaxies and that instead has a
pseudobulge formed by its central bar.⁸⁷

The Galactic Center is marked by an intense radio source named Sagittarius
A* (pronounced Sagittarius A-star). The motion of material around the
center indicates that Sagittarius A* harbors a massive, compact object.⁸⁸
This concentration of mass is best explained as a supermassive black
hole[nb 3]¹⁴ ⁸² (SMBH) with an estimated mass of 4.1–4.5 million times the
mass of the Sun.⁸² The rate of accretion of the SMBH is consistent with an
inactive galactic nucleus, being estimated at around 1×10−5 M☉ y−1.⁸⁹
Observations indicate that there are SMBH located near the center of most
normal galaxies.⁹⁰ ⁹¹

The nature of the Milky Way's bar is actively debated, with estimates for
its half-length and orientation spanning from 1 to 5 kpc (3,000–16,000 ly)
and 10–50 degrees relative to the line of sight from Earth to the Galactic
Center.⁸⁴ ⁸⁵ ⁹² Certain authors advocate that the Milky Way features two
distinct bars, one nestled within the other.⁹³ However, RR Lyr variables do
not trace a prominent Galactic bar.⁸⁵ ⁹⁴ ⁹⁵ The bar may be surrounded by a
ring called the "5-kpc ring" that contains a large fraction of the
molecular hydrogen present in the Milky Way, as well as most of the Milky
Way's star-formation activity. Viewed from the Andromeda Galaxy, it would
be the brightest feature of the Milky Way.⁹⁶ X-ray emission from the core
is aligned with the massive stars surrounding the central bar⁸⁹ and the
Galactic ridge.⁹⁷

In 2010, two gigantic spherical bubbles of high energy emission were
detected to the north and the south of the Milky Way core, using data of
the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope. The diameter of each of the bubbles is
about 25,000 light-years (7.7 kpc); they stretch up to Grus and to Virgo on
the night-sky of the southern hemisphere.⁹⁸ ⁹⁹ Subsequently, observations
with the Parkes Telescope at radio frequencies identified polarized
emission that is associated with the Fermi bubbles. These observations are
best interpreted as a magnetized outflow driven by star formation in the
central 640 ly (200 pc) of the Milky Way.¹⁰⁰

Later, on January 5, 2015, NASA reported observing an X-ray flare 400 times
brighter than usual, a record-breaker, from Sagittarius A*, a black hole in
the center of the Milky Way. The unusual event may have been caused by the
breaking apart of an asteroid falling into the black hole or by the
entanglement of magnetic field lines within gas flowing into Sagittarius
A*, according to astronomers.⁷⁴

Spiral arms

For more details on this topic, see Spiral galaxy.

Outside the gravitational influence of the Galactic bars, astronomers
generally organize the structure of the interstellar medium and stars in
the disk of the Milky Way into four spiral arms.¹⁰¹ Spiral arms typically
contain a higher density of interstellar gas and dust than the Galactic
average as well as a greater concentration of star formation, as traced by
H II regions¹⁰² ¹⁰³ and molecular clouds.¹⁰⁴

Maps of the Milky Way's spiral structure are notoriously uncertain and
exhibit striking differences.⁷³ ¹⁰¹ ¹⁰³ ¹⁰⁵ ¹⁰⁶ ¹⁰⁷ ¹⁰⁸ ¹⁰⁹ Some 150 years
after Alexander (1852)¹¹⁰ first suggested that the Milky Way is a spiral,
there is currently no consensus on the nature of the Milky Way's spiral
arms. Perfect logarithmic spiral patterns only crudely describe features
near the Sun,¹⁰³ ¹⁰⁸ because galaxies commonly have arms that branch,
merge, twist unexpectedly, and feature a degree of irregularity.⁸⁵ ¹⁰⁸ ¹⁰⁹
The possible scenario of the Sun within a spur / Local arm¹⁰³ emphasizes
that point and indicates that such features are probably not unique, and
exist elsewhere in the Milky Way.¹⁰⁸

As in most spiral galaxies, each spiral arm can be described as a
logarithmic spiral. Estimates of the pitch angle of the arms range from
about 7° to 25°.¹¹¹ ¹¹² There are thought to be four spiral arms that all
start near the Milky Way's center. These are named as follows, with the
positions of the arms shown in the image at right:

Two spiral arms, the Scutum–Centaurus arm and the Carina–Sagittarius arm,
have tangent points inside the Sun's orbit about the center of the Milky
Way. If these arms contain an overdensity of stars compared to the average
density of stars in the Galactic disk, it would be detectable by counting
the stars near the tangent point. Two surveys of near-infrared light, which
is sensitive primarily to red giants and not affected by dust extinction,
detected the predicted overabundance in the Scutum–Centaurus arm but not in
the Carina–Sagittarius arm: the Scutum-Centaurus Arm contains approximately
30% more red giants than would be expected in the absence of a spiral
arm.¹¹¹ ¹¹⁴ In 2008, Robert Benjamin of the University of
Wisconsin–Whitewater used this observation to suggest that the Milky Way
possesses only two major stellar arms: the Perseus arm and the
Scutum–Centaurus arm. The rest of the arms contain excess gas but not
excess old stars.⁷³ In December 2013, astronomers found that the
distribution of young stars and star-forming regions matches the four-arm
spiral description of the Milky Way.¹¹⁵ ¹¹⁶ ¹¹⁷ Thus, the Milky Way appears
to have two spiral arms as traced by old stars and four spiral arms as
traced by gas and young stars. The explanation for this apparent
discrepancy is unclear.¹¹⁷

The Near 3 kpc Arm (also called Expanding 3 kpc Arm or simply 3 kpc Arm)
was discovered in the 1950s by astronomer van Woerden and collaborators
through 21-centimeter radio measurements of HI (atomic hydrogen).¹¹⁸ ¹¹⁹ It
was found to be expanding away from the central bulge at more than 50 km/s.
It is located in the fourth galactic quadrant at a distance of about 5.2
kpc from the Sun and 3.3 kpc from the Galactic Center. The Far 3 kpc Arm
was discovered in 2008 by astronomer Tom Dame (Harvard-Smithsonian CfA). It
is located in the first galactic quadrant at a distance of 3 kpc (about
10,000 ly) from the Galactic Center.¹¹⁹ ¹²⁰

A simulation published in 2011 suggested that the Milky Way may have
obtained its spiral arm structure as a result of repeated collisions with
the Sagittarius Dwarf Elliptical Galaxy.¹²¹

It has been suggested that the Milky Way contains two different spiral
patterns: an inner one, formed by the Sagittarius arm, that rotates fast
and an outer one, formed by the Carina and Perseus arms, whose rotation
velocity is slower and whose arms are tightly wound. In this scenario,
suggested by numerical simulations of the dynamics of the different spiral
arms, the outer pattern would form an outer pseudoring¹²² and the two
patterns would be connected by the Cygnus arm.¹²³

Outside of the major spiral arms is the Monoceros Ring (or Outer Ring), a
ring of gas and stars torn from other galaxies billions of years ago.
However, several members of the scientific community recently restated
their position affirming the Monoceros structure is nothing more than an
over-density produced by the flared and warped thick disk of the Milky
Way.¹²⁴

Halo

The Galactic disk is surrounded by a spheroidal halo of old stars and
globular clusters, of which 90% lie within 100,000 light-years (30 kpc) of
the Galactic Center.¹²⁵ However, a few globular clusters have been found
farther, such as PAL 4 and AM1 at more than 200,000 light-years from the
Galactic Center. About 40% of the Milky Way's clusters are on retrograde
orbits, which means they move in the opposite direction from the Milky Way
rotation.¹²⁶ The globular clusters can follow rosette orbits about the
Milky Way, in contrast to the elliptical orbit of a planet around a
star.¹²⁷

Although the disk contains dust that obscures the view in some wavelengths,
the halo component does not. Active star formation takes place in the disk
(especially in the spiral arms, which represent areas of high density), but
does not take place in the halo, as there is little gas cool enough to
collapse into stars.¹⁵ Open clusters are also located primarily in the
disk.¹²⁸

Discoveries in the early 21st century have added dimension to the knowledge
of the Milky Way's structure. With the discovery that the disk of the
Andromeda Galaxy (M31) extends much further than previously thought,¹²⁹ the
possibility of the disk of the Milky Way extending further is apparent, and
this is supported by evidence from the discovery of the Outer Arm extension
of the Cygnus Arm¹¹³ ¹³⁰ and of a similar extension of the Scutum-Centaurus
Arm.¹³¹ With the discovery of the Sagittarius Dwarf Elliptical Galaxy came
the discovery of a ribbon of galactic debris as the polar orbit of the
dwarf and its interaction with the Milky Way tears it apart. Similarly,
with the discovery of the Canis Major Dwarf Galaxy, it was found that a
ring of galactic debris from its interaction with the Milky Way encircles
the Galactic disk.

On January 9, 2006, Mario Jurić and others of Princeton University
announced that the Sloan Digital Sky Survey of the northern sky found a
huge and diffuse structure (spread out across an area around 5,000 times
the size of a full moon) within the Milky Way that does not seem to fit
within current models. The collection of stars rises close to perpendicular
to the plane of the spiral arms of the Milky Way. The proposed likely
interpretation is that a dwarf galaxy is merging with the Milky Way. This
galaxy is tentatively named the Virgo Stellar Stream and is found in the
direction of Virgo about 30,000 light-years (9 kpc) away.¹³²

Gaseous halo

In addition to the stellar halo, the Chandra X-ray Observatory, XMM-Newton,
and Suzaku have provided evidence that there is a gaseous halo with a large
amount of hot gas. The halo extends for hundreds of thousand of light
years, much further than the stellar halo and close to the distance of the
Large and Small Magellanic Clouds. The mass of this hot halo is nearly
equivalent to the mass of the Milky Way itself.¹³³ ¹³⁴ ¹³⁵ The temperature
of this halo gas is between 1 million and 2.5 million kelvin.¹³⁶

Observations of distant galaxies indicate that the Universe had about
one-sixth as much baryonic (ordinary) matter as dark matter when it was
just a few billion years old. However, only about half of those baryons are
accounted for in the modern Universe based on observations of nearby
galaxies like the Milky Way.¹³⁷ If the finding that the mass of the halo is
comparable to the mass of the Milky Way is confirmed, it could be the
identity of the missing baryons around the Milky Way.¹³⁷

Sun's location and neighborhood

Diagram of the Sun's location in the Milky Way. The angles represent
longitudes in the galactic coordinate system.
Diagram of the stars in the Solar neighborhood

The Sun is near the inner rim of the Orion Arm, within the Local Fluff of
the Local Bubble, and in the Gould Belt, at a distance of 8.33 ± 0.35
kiloparsecs (27,200 ± 1,100 ly) from the Galactic Center.¹⁴ ⁸² ¹³⁸ The Sun
is currently 5–30 parsecs (16–98 ly) from the central plane of the Galactic
disk.¹³⁹ The distance between the local arm and the next arm out, the
Perseus Arm, is about 2,000 parsecs (6,500 ly).¹⁴⁰ The Sun, and thus the
Solar System, is located in the Milky Way's galactic habitable zone.

There are about 208 stars brighter than absolute magnitude 8.5 within a
sphere with a radius of 15 parsecs (49 ly) from the Sun, giving a density
of one star per 69 cubic parsec, or one star per 2,360 cubic light-year
(from List of nearest bright stars). On the other hand, there are 64 known
stars (of any magnitude, not counting 4 brown dwarfs) within 5 parsecs (16
ly) of the Sun, giving a density of about one star per 8.2 cubic parsec, or
one per 284 cubic light-year (from List of nearest stars). This illustrates
the fact that there are far more faint stars than bright stars: in the
entire sky, there are about 500 stars brighter than apparent magnitude 4
but 15.5 million stars brighter than apparent magnitude 14.¹⁴¹

The apex of the Sun's way, or the solar apex, is the direction that the Sun
travels through space in the Milky Way. The general direction of the Sun's
Galactic motion is towards the star Vega near the constellation of
Hercules, at an angle of roughly 60 sky degrees to the direction of the
Galactic Center. The Sun's orbit about the Milky Way is expected to be
roughly elliptical with the addition of perturbations due to the Galactic
spiral arms and non-uniform mass distributions. In addition, the Sun
oscillates up and down relative to the Galactic plane approximately 2.7
times per orbit. This is very similar to how a simple harmonic oscillator
works with no drag force (damping) term. These oscillations were until
recently thought to coincide with mass lifeform extinction periods on
Earth.¹⁴² However, a reanalysis of the effects of the Sun's transit through
the spiral structure based on CO data has failed to find a correlation.¹⁴³

It takes the Solar System about 240 million years to complete one orbit of
the Milky Way (a galactic year),¹⁵ so the Sun is thought to have completed
18–20 orbits during its lifetime and 1/1250 of a revolution since the
origin of humans. The orbital speed of the Solar System about the center of
the Milky Way is approximately 220 km/s or 0.073% of the speed of light.
The Sun moves through the heliosphere at 84,000 km/h (52,000 mph). At this
speed, it takes around 1,400 years for the Solar System to travel a
distance of 1 light-year, or 8 days to travel 1 AU (astronomical unit).¹⁴⁴
The Solar System is headed in the direction of the zodiacal constellation
Scorpius, which follows the ecliptic.¹⁴⁵

Galactic rotation

The stars and gas in the Milky Way rotate about its center differentially,
meaning that the rotation period varies with location. As is typical for
spiral galaxies, the orbital speed of most stars in the Milky Way does not
depend strongly on their distance from the center. Away from the central
bulge or outer rim, the typical stellar orbital speed is between 210 and
240 km/s.¹⁴⁸ Hence the orbital period of the typical star is directly
proportional only to the length of the path traveled. This is unlike the
situation within the Solar System, where two-body gravitational dynamics
dominate and different orbits have significantly different velocities
associated with them. The rotation curve (shown in the figure) describes
this rotation. Toward the center of the Milky Way the orbit speeds are too
low, whereas beyond 7 kpcs the speeds are too high to match what would be
expected from the universal law of gravitation.

If the Milky Way contained only the mass observed in stars, gas, and other
baryonic (ordinary) matter, the rotation speed would decrease with distance
from the center. However, the observed curve is relatively flat, indicating
that there is additional mass that cannot be detected directly with
electromagnetic radiation. This inconsistency is attributed to dark
matter.³² The rotation curve of the Milky Way agrees with the universal
rotation curve of spiral galaxies, the best evidence for the existence of
dark matter in galaxies. Alternatively, a minority of astronomers propose
that a modification of the law of gravity may explain the observed rotation
curve.¹⁴⁹

Formation

Main article: Galaxy formation and evolution

The Milky Way began as one or several small overdensities in the mass
distribution in the Universe shortly after the Big Bang. Some of these
overdensities were the seeds of globular clusters in which the oldest
remaining stars in what is now the Milky Way formed. These stars and
clusters now comprise the stellar halo of the Milky Way. Within a few
billion years of the birth of the first stars, the mass of the Milky Way
was large enough so that it was spinning relatively quickly. Due to
conservation of angular momentum, this led the gaseous interstellar medium
to collapse from a roughly spheroidal shape to a disk. Therefore, later
generations of stars formed in this spiral disk. Most younger stars,
including the Sun, are observed to be in the disk.¹⁵⁰ ¹⁵¹

Since the first stars began to form, the Milky Way has grown through both
galaxy mergers (particularly early in the Milky Way's growth) and accretion
of gas directly from the Galactic halo.¹⁵¹ The Milky Way is currently
accreting material from two of its nearest satellite galaxies, the Large
and Small Magellanic Clouds, through the Magellanic Stream. Direct
accretion of gas is observed in high-velocity clouds like the Smith
Cloud.¹⁵² ¹⁵³ However, properties of the Milky Way such as stellar mass,
angular momentum, and metallicity in its outermost regions suggest it has
undergone no mergers with large galaxies in the last 10 billion years. This
lack of recent major mergers is unusual among similar spiral galaxies; its
neighbour the Andromeda Galaxy appears to have a more typical history
shaped by more recent mergers with relatively large galaxies.¹⁵⁴ ¹⁵⁵

According to recent studies, the Milky Way as well as Andromeda lie in what
in the galaxy color–magnitude diagram is known as the green valley, a
region populated by galaxies in transition from the blue cloud (galaxies
actively forming new stars) to the red sequence (galaxies that lack star
formation). Star-formation activity in green valley galaxies is slowing as
they run out of star-forming gas in the interstellar medium. In simulated
galaxies with similar properties, star formation will typically have been
extinguished within about five billion years from now, even accounting for
the expected, short-term increase in the rate of star formation due to the
collision between both the Milky Way and the Andromeda Galaxy.¹⁵⁶ In fact,
measurements of other galaxies similar to the Milky Way suggest it is among
the reddest and brightest spiral galaxies that are still forming new stars
and it is just slightly bluer than the bluest red sequence galaxies.¹⁵⁷

Age

Globular clusters are among the oldest objects in the Milky Way, which thus
set a lower limit on the age of the Milky Way. The ages of individual stars
in the Milky Way can be estimated by measuring the abundance of long-lived
radioactive elements such as thorium-232 and uranium-238, then comparing
the results to estimates of their original abundance, a technique called
nucleocosmochronology. These yield values of about 12.5 ± 3 billion years
for CS 31082-001¹⁵⁹ and 13.8 ± 4 billion years for BD +17° 3248.¹⁶⁰ Once a
white dwarf is formed, it begins to undergo radiative cooling and the
surface temperature steadily drops. By measuring the temperatures of the
coolest of these white dwarfs and comparing them to their expected initial
temperature, an age estimate can be made. With this technique, the age of
the globular cluster M4 was estimated as 12.7 ± 0.7 billion years. Age
estimates of the oldest of these clusters gives a best fit estimate of 12.6
billion years, and a 95% confidence upper limit of 16 billion years.¹⁶¹

Several individual stars have been found in the Milky Way's halo with
measured ages very close to the 13.80-billion-year age of the Universe. In
2007, a star in the galactic halo, HE 1523-0901, was estimated to be about
13.2 billion years old. As the oldest known object in the Milky Way at that
time, this measurement placed a lower limit on the age of the Milky Way.¹⁶²
This estimate was made using the UV-Visual Echelle Spectrograph of the Very
Large Telescope to measure the relative strengths of spectral lines caused
by the presence of thorium and other elements created by the R-process. The
line strengths yield abundances of different elemental isotopes, from which
an estimate of the age of the star can be derived using
nucleocosmochronology.¹⁶² Another star, HD 140283, is 14.5 ± 0.7 billion
years old and thus formed at least 13.8 billion years ago.⁹ ¹⁶³

The age of stars in the galactic thin disk has also been estimated using
nucleocosmochronology. Measurements of thin disk stars yield an estimate
that the thin disk formed 8.8 ± 1.7 billion years ago. These measurements
suggest there was a hiatus of almost 5 billion years between the formation
of the galactic halo and the thin disk.¹⁶⁴

Diagram of the galaxies in the Local Group relative to the Milky Way
The position of the Local Group within the Virgo Supercluster
Main article: Local Group

The Milky Way and the Andromeda Galaxy are a binary system of giant spiral
galaxies belonging to a group of 50 closely bound galaxies known as the
Local Group, itself being part of the Virgo Supercluster. The Virgo
Supercluster forms part of a greater structure, called Laniakea.¹⁶⁵

Two smaller galaxies and a number of dwarf galaxies in the Local Group
orbit the Milky Way. The largest of these is the Large Magellanic Cloud
with a diameter of 14,000 light-years. It has a close companion, the Small
Magellanic Cloud. The Magellanic Stream is a stream of neutral hydrogen gas
extending from these two small galaxies across 100° of the sky. The stream
is thought to have been dragged from the Magellanic Clouds in tidal
interactions with the Milky Way.¹⁶⁶ Some of the dwarf galaxies orbiting the
Milky Way are Canis Major Dwarf (the closest), Sagittarius Dwarf Elliptical
Galaxy, Ursa Minor Dwarf, Sculptor Dwarf, Sextans Dwarf, Fornax Dwarf, and
Leo I Dwarf. The smallest dwarf galaxies of the Milky Way are only 500
light-years in diameter. These include Carina Dwarf, Draco Dwarf, and Leo
II Dwarf. There may still be undetected dwarf galaxies that are dynamically
bound to the Milky Way, which is supported by the detection of nine new
satellites of the Milky Way in a relatively small patch of the night sky in
2015.¹⁶⁷ There are also some dwarf galaxies that have already been absorbed
by the Milky Way, such as Omega Centauri.¹⁶⁸

In 2014 researchers reported that most satellite galaxies of the Milky Way
actually lie in a huge disk, with almost all satellite galaxies moving in
the same direction within this disk.¹⁶⁹ This came as a surprise: according
to standard cosmology, the galaxies should form in halos of dark matter, be
widely distributed and should move in random directions. This discrepancy
is still not fully explained.¹⁷⁰

In January 2006, researchers reported that the heretofore unexplained warp
in the disk of the Milky Way has now been mapped and found to be a ripple
or vibration set up by the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds as they orbit
the Milky Way, causing vibrations when they pass through its edges.
Previously, these two galaxies, at around 2% of the mass of the Milky Way,
were considered too small to influence the Milky Way. However, in a
computer model, the movement of these two galaxies creates a dark matter
wake that amplifies their influence on the larger Milky Way.¹⁷¹

Current measurements suggest the Andromeda Galaxy is approaching us at 100
to 140 kilometers per second. In 3 to 4 billion years, there may be an
Andromeda–Milky Way collision, depending on the importance of unknown
lateral components to the galaxies' relative motion. If they collide, the
chance of individual stars colliding with each other is extremely low, but
instead the two galaxies will merge to form a single elliptical galaxy or
perhaps a large disk galaxy¹⁷² over the course of about a billion years.¹⁷³

Velocity

Although special relativity states that there is no "preferred" inertial
frame of reference in space with which to compare the Milky Way, the Milky
Way does have a velocity with respect to cosmological frames of reference.

One such frame of reference is the Hubble flow, the apparent motions of
galaxy clusters due to the expansion of space. Individual galaxies,
including the Milky Way, have peculiar velocities relative to the average
flow. Thus, to compare the Milky Way to the Hubble flow, one must consider
a volume large enough so that the expansion of the Universe dominates over
local, random motions. A large enough volume means that the mean motion of
galaxies within this volume is equal to the Hubble flow. Astronomers
believe the Milky Way is moving at approximately 630 km per second with
respect to this local co-moving frame of reference.¹⁷⁴ The Milky Way is
moving in the general direction of the Great Attractor and other galaxy
clusters, including the Shapley supercluster, behind it.¹⁷⁵ The Local Group
(a cluster of gravitationally bound galaxies containing, among others, the
Milky Way and the Andromeda Galaxy) is part of a supercluster called the
Local Supercluster, centered near the Virgo Cluster: although they are
moving away from each other at 967 km/s as part of the Hubble flow, this
velocity is less than would be expected given the 16.8 million pc distance
due to the gravitational attraction between the Local Group and the Virgo
Cluster.¹⁷⁶

Another reference frame is provided by the cosmic microwave background
(CMB). The Milky Way is moving at 552 ± 6 km/s¹⁷ with respect to the
photons of the CMB, toward 10.5 right ascension, −24° declination (J2000
epoch, near the center of Hydra). This motion is observed by satellites
such as the Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE) and the Wilkinson Microwave
Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) as a dipole contribution to the CMB, as photons in
equilibrium in the CMB frame get blue-shifted in the direction of the
motion and red-shifted in the opposite direction.¹⁷

Etymology and mythology

Main articles: List of names for the Milky Way and Milky Way (mythology)

In western culture the name "Milky Way" is derived from its appearance as a
dim un-resolved "milky" glowing band arching across the night sky. The term
is a translation of the Classical Latin via lactea, in turn derived from
the Hellenistic Greek γαλαξίας, short for γαλαξίας κύκλος (galaxías kýklos,
"milky circle"). The Ancient Greek γαλαξίας (galaxias) – from root γαλακτ-,
γάλα ("milk") + -ίας (forming adjectives) – is also the root of "galaxy",
the name for our, and later all such, collections of stars.²¹ ¹⁷⁷ ¹⁷⁸ ¹⁷⁹

The Milky Way, or "milk circle", was just one of 11 "circles" the Greeks
identified in the sky, others being the zodiac, the meridian, the horizon,
the equator, the tropics of Cancer and Capricorn, Arctic and Antarctic
circles, and two colure circles passing through both poles.¹⁸⁰

Astronomical history

See also: Galaxy § Observation history

In Meteorologica (DK 59 A80), Aristotle (384–322 BC) wrote that the Greek
philosophers Anaxagoras (c. 500–428 BC) and Democritus (460–370 BC)
proposed that the Milky Way might consist of distant stars. However,
Aristotle himself believed the Milky Way to be caused by "the ignition of
the fiery exhalation of some stars which were large, numerous and close
together" and that the "ignition takes place in the upper part of the
atmosphere, in the region of the world which is continuous with the
heavenly motions."¹⁸¹ The Neoplatonist philosopher Olympiodorus the Younger
(c. 495–570 A.D.) criticized this view, arguing that if the Milky Way were
sublunary, it should appear different at different times and places on
Earth, and that it should have parallax, which it does not. In his view,
the Milky Way is celestial. This idea would be influential later in the
Islamic world.¹⁸²

The Persian astronomer Abū Rayhān al-Bīrūnī (973–1048) proposed that the
Milky Way is "a collection of countless fragments of the nature of nebulous
stars".¹⁸³ The Andalusian astronomer Avempace (d 1138) proposed the Milky
Way to be made up of many stars but appears to be a continuous image due to
the effect of refraction in Earth's atmosphere, citing his observation of a
conjunction of Jupiter and Mars in 1106 or 1107 as evidence.¹⁸¹ Ibn Qayyim
Al-Jawziyya (1292–1350) proposed that the Milky Way is "a myriad of tiny
stars packed together in the sphere of the fixed stars" and that these
stars are larger than planets.¹⁸⁴

According to Jamil Ragep, the Persian astronomer Naṣīr al-Dīn al-Ṭūsī
(1201–1274) in his Tadhkira writes: "The Milky Way, i.e. the Galaxy, is
made up of a very large number of small, tightly clustered stars, which, on
account of their concentration and smallness, seem to be cloudy patches.
Because of this, it was likened to milk in color."¹⁸⁵

Actual proof of the Milky Way consisting of many stars came in 1610 when
Galileo Galilei used a telescope to study the Milky Way and discovered that
it is composed of a huge number of faint stars.¹⁸⁶ ¹⁸⁷ In a treatise in
1755, Immanuel Kant, drawing on earlier work by Thomas Wright,¹⁸⁸
speculated (correctly) that the Milky Way might be a rotating body of a
huge number of stars, held together by gravitational forces akin to the
Solar System but on much larger scales.¹⁸⁹ The resulting disk of stars
would be seen as a band on the sky from our perspective inside the disk.
Kant also conjectured that some of the nebulae visible in the night sky
might be separate "galaxies" themselves, similar to our own. Kant referred
to both the Milky Way and the "extragalactic nebulae" as "island
universes", a term still current up to the 1930s.¹⁹⁰ ¹⁹¹ ¹⁹²

The first attempt to describe the shape of the Milky Way and the position
of the Sun within it was carried out by William Herschel in 1785 by
carefully counting the number of stars in different regions of the visible
sky. He produced a diagram of the shape of the Milky Way with the Solar
System close to the center.¹⁹³

In 1845, Lord Rosse constructed a new telescope and was able to distinguish
between elliptical and spiral-shaped nebulae. He also managed to make out
individual point sources in some of these nebulae, lending credence to
Kant's earlier conjecture.¹⁹⁴

In 1917, Heber Curtis had observed the nova S Andromedae within the Great
Andromeda Nebula (Messier object 31). Searching the photographic record, he
found 11 more novae. Curtis noticed that these novae were, on average, 10
magnitudes fainter than those that occurred within the Milky Way. As a
result, he was able to come up with a distance estimate of 150,000 parsecs.
He became a proponent of the "island universes" hypothesis, which held that
the spiral nebulae were actually independent galaxies.¹⁹⁵ In 1920 the Great
Debate took place between Harlow Shapley and Heber Curtis, concerning the
nature of the Milky Way, spiral nebulae, and the dimensions of the
universe. To support his claim that the Great Andromeda Nebula is an
external galaxy, Curtis noted the appearance of dark lanes resembling the
dust clouds in the Milky Way, as well as the significant Doppler shift.¹⁹⁶

The controversy was conclusively settled by Edwin Hubble in the early 1920s
using the Mount Wilson observatory 2.5 m Hooker telescope. With the
light-gathering power of this new telescope he was able to produce
astronomical photographs that resolved the outer parts of some spiral
nebulae as collections of individual stars. He was also able to identify
some Cepheid variables that he could use as a benchmark to estimate the
distance to the nebulae. He found that the Andromeda Nebula is 275,000
parsecs from the Sun, far too distant to be part of the Milky Way.²⁵ ¹⁹⁷

  (London, England: H. Chapelle, 1750).
  - On page 57, Wright stated that despite their mutual gravitational
    attraction, the stars in the constellations don't collide because they
    are in orbit, so centrifugal force keeps them separated: " …
    centrifugal force, which not only preserves them in their orbits, but
    prevents them from rushing all together, by the common universal law of
    gravity, … "
  - On page 48, Wright stated that the form of the Milky Way is a ring: " …
    the stars are not infinitely dispersed and distributed in a promiscuous
    manner throughout all the mundane space, without order or design, …
    this phænomenon [is] no other than a certain effect arising from the
    observer's situation, … To a spectator placed in an indefinite space, …
    it [i.e. the Milky Way (Via Lactea)] [is] a vast ring of stars … "
  - On page 65, Wright speculated that the central body of the Milky Way,
    around which the rest of the galaxy revolves, might not be visible to
    us: " ... the central body A, being supposed as incognitum [i.e. an
    unknown], without [i.e. outside of] the finite view; ... "
  - On page 73, Wright called the Milky Way the Vortex Magnus (the great
    whirlpool) and estimated its diameter to be 8.64×10¹² miles (13.9×10¹²
    km).
  - On page 33, Wright speculated that there are a vast number of inhabited
    planets in the galaxy: " … ; therefore we may justly suppose, that so
    many radiant bodies [i.e. stars] were not created barely to enlighten
    an infinite void, but to … display an infinite shapeless universe,
    crowded with myriads of glorious worlds, all variously revolving round
    them; and … with an inconceivable variety of beings and states, animate
    … "
[189] Immanuel Kant, Allgemeine Naturgeschichte und Theorie des Himmels …
  [Universal Natural History and Theory of Heaven … ], (Koenigsberg and
  Leipzig, (Germany): Johann Friederich Petersen, 1755). On pages 2–3, Kant
  acknowledged his debt to Thomas Wright: "Dem Herrn Wright von Durham,
  einen Engeländer, war es vorbehalten, einen glücklichen Schritt zu einer
  Bemerkung zu thun, welche von ihm selber zu keiner gar zu tüchtigen
  Absicht gebraucht zu seyn scheinet, und deren nützliche Anwendung er
  nicht genugsam beobachtet hat. Er betrachtete die Fixsterne nicht als ein
  ungeordnetes und ohne Absicht zerstreutes Gewimmel, sondern er fand eine
  systematische Verfassung im Ganzen, und eine allgemeine Beziehung dieser
  Gestirne gegen einen Hauptplan der Raume, die sie einnehmen." (To Mr.
  Wright of Durham, an Englishman, it was reserved to take a happy step
  towards an observation, which seemed, to him and to no one else, to be
  needed for a clever idea, the exploitation of which he hasn't studied
  sufficiently. He regarded the fixed stars not as a disorganized swarm
  that was scattered without a design; rather, he found a systematic shape
  in the whole, and a general relation between these stars and the
  principal plane of the space that they occupy.)
[190] Kant (1755), pages xxxiii–xxxvi of the Preface (Vorrede): "Ich
  betrachtete die Art neblichter Sterne, deren Herr von Maupertuis in der
  Abhandlung von der Figur der Gestirne gedenket, und die die Figur von
  mehr oder weniger offenen Ellipsen vorstellen, und versicherte mich
  leicht, daß sie nichts anders als eine Häufung vieler Fixsterne seyn
  können. Die jederzeit abgemessene Rundung dieser Figuren belehrte mich,
  daß hier ein unbegreiflich zahlreiches Sternenheer, und zwar um einen
  gemeinschaftlichen Mittelpunkt, müste geordnet seyn, weil sonst ihre
  freye Stellungen gegen einander, wohl irreguläre Gestalten, aber nicht
  abgemessene Figuren vorstellen würden. Ich sahe auch ein: daß sie in dem
  System, darinn sie sich vereinigt befinden, vornemlich auf eine Fläche
  beschränkt seyn müßten, weil sie nicht zirkelrunde, sondern elliptische
  Figuren abbilden, und daß sie wegen ihres blassen Lichts unbegreiflich
  weit von uns abstehen." (I considered the type of nebulous stars, which
  Mr. de Maupertuis considered in his treatise on the shape of stars, and
  which present the figures of more or less open ellipses, and I readily
  assured myself, that they could be nothing else than a cluster of fixed
  stars. That these figures always measured round informed me that here an
  inconceivably numerous host of stars, [which were clustered] around a
  common center, must be orderly, because otherwise their free positions
  among each other would likely present irregular forms, not measurable
  figures. I also realized: that in the system in which they find
  themselves bound, they must be restricted primarily to a plane, because
  they display not circular, but elliptical figures, and that on account of
  their faint light, they are located inconceivably far from us.)

Molecular cloud

See also: Solar nebula

A molecular cloud, sometimes called a stellar nursery (if star formation is
occurring within), is a type of interstellar cloud, the density and size of
which permit the formation of molecules, most commonly molecular hydrogen
(H₂). This is in contrast to other areas of the interstellar medium that
contain predominantly ionized gas.

Molecular hydrogen is difficult to detect by infrared and radio
observations, so the molecule most often used to determine the presence of
H₂ is carbon monoxide (CO). The ratio between CO luminosity and H₂ mass is
thought to be constant, although there are reasons to doubt this assumption
in observations of some other galaxies.¹

Occurrence

Within the Milky Way, molecular gas clouds account for less than one
percent of the volume of the interstellar medium (ISM), yet it is also the
densest part of the medium, comprising roughly half of the total gas mass
interior to the Sun's galactic orbit. The bulk of the molecular gas is
contained in a ring between 3.5 and 7.5 kiloparsecs (11,000 and 24,000
light-years) from the center of the Milky Way (the Sun is about 8.5
kiloparsecs from the center).² Large scale CO maps of the galaxy show that
the position of this gas correlates with the spiral arms of the galaxy.³
That molecular gas occurs predominantly in the spiral arms suggests that
molecular clouds must form and dissociate on a timescale shorter than 10
million years—the time it takes for material to pass through the arm
region.⁴

Vertically to the plane of the galaxy, the molecular gas inhabits the
narrow midplane of the galactic disc with a characteristic scale height, Z,
of approximately 50 to 75 parsecs, much thinner than the warm atomic (Z
from 130 to 400 parsecs) and warm ionized (Z around 1000 parsecs) gaseous
components of the ISM.⁶ The exception to the ionized-gas distribution are H
II regions, which are bubbles of hot ionized gas created in molecular
clouds by the intense radiation given off by young massive stars and as
such they have approximately the same vertical distribution as the
molecular gas.

This distribution of molecular gas is averaged out over large distances;
however, the small scale distribution of the gas is highly irregular with
most of it concentrated in discrete clouds and cloud complexes.²

Types of molecular cloud

Giant molecular clouds

A vast assemblage of molecular gas with a mass of approximately 10³ to 10⁷
times the mass of the Sun⁸ is called a giant molecular cloud (GMC). GMCs
are around 15 to 600 light-years in diameter (5 to 200 parsecs).⁸ Whereas
the average density in the solar vicinity is one particle per cubic
centimetre, the average density of a GMC is a hundred to a thousand times
as great. Although the Sun is much more dense than a GMC, the volume of a
GMC is so great that it contains much more mass than the Sun. The
substructure of a GMC is a complex pattern of filaments, sheets, bubbles,
and irregular clumps.⁴

The densest parts of the filaments and clumps are called "molecular cores",
while the densest molecular cores are called "dense molecular cores" and
have densities in excess of 10⁴ to 10⁶ particles per cubic centimeter.
Observationally, typical molecular cores are traced with CO and dense
molecular cores are traced with ammonia. The concentration of dust within
molecular cores is normally sufficient to block light from background stars
so that they appear in silhouette as dark nebulae.⁹

GMCs are so large that "local" ones can cover a significant fraction of a
constellation; thus they are often referred to by the name of that
constellation, e.g. the Orion Molecular Cloud (OMC) or the Taurus Molecular
Cloud (TMC). These local GMCs are arrayed in a ring in the neighborhood of
the Sun coinciding with the Gould Belt.¹⁰ The most massive collection of
molecular clouds in the galaxy forms an asymmetrical ring about the
galactic center at a radius of 120 parsecs; the largest component of this
ring is the Sagittarius B2 complex. The Sagittarius region is chemically
rich and is often used as an exemplar by astronomers searching for new
molecules in interstellar space.¹¹

Small molecular clouds

Main article: Bok globule

Isolated gravitationally-bound small molecular clouds with masses less than
a few hundred times that of the Sun are called Bok globules. The densest
parts of small molecular clouds are equivalent to the molecular cores found
in GMCs and are often included in the same studies.

High-latitude diffuse molecular clouds

Main article: Infrared cirrus

In 1984 IRAS identified a new type of diffuse molecular cloud.¹³ These were
diffuse filamentary clouds that are visible at high galactic latitudes.
These clouds have a typical density of 30 particles per cubic centimeter.¹⁴

Processes

Star formation

Main article: Star formation

The formation of stars occurs exclusively within molecular clouds. This is
a natural consequence of their low temperatures and high densities, because
the gravitational force acting to collapse the cloud must exceed the
internal pressures that are acting "outward" to prevent a collapse. There
is observed evidence that the large, star-forming clouds are confined to a
large degree by their own gravity (like stars, planets, and galaxies)
rather than by external pressure. The evidence comes from the fact that the
"turbulent" velocities inferred from CO linewidth scale in the same manner
as the orbital velocity (a virial relation).

Physics

The physics of molecular clouds are poorly understood and much debated.
Their internal motions are governed by turbulence in a cold, magnetized
gas, for which the turbulent motions are highly supersonic but comparable
to the speeds of magnetic disturbances. This state is thought to lose
energy rapidly, requiring either an overall collapse or a steady
reinjection of energy. At the same time, the clouds are known to be
disrupted by some process—most likely the effects of massive stars—before a
significant fraction of their mass has become stars.

Molecular clouds, and especially GMCs, are often the home of astronomical
masers.

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is the United
States government agency responsible for the civilian space program as well
as aeronautics and aerospace research.

President Dwight D. Eisenhower established the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration (NASA) in 1958⁵ with a distinctly civilian (rather
than military) orientation encouraging peaceful applications in space
science. The National Aeronautics and Space Act was passed on July 29,
1958, disestablishing NASA's predecessor, the National Advisory Committee
for Aeronautics (NACA). The new agency became operational on October 1,
1958.⁶ ⁷

Since that time, most US space exploration efforts have been led by NASA,
including the Apollo moon-landing missions, the Skylab space station, and
later the Space Shuttle. Currently, NASA is supporting the International
Space Station and is overseeing the development of the Orion Multi-Purpose
Crew Vehicle, the Space Launch System and Commercial Crew vehicles. The
agency is also responsible for the Launch Services Program (LSP) which
provides oversight of launch operations and countdown management for
unmanned NASA launches.

NASA science is focused on better understanding Earth through the Earth
Observing System,⁸ advancing heliophysics through the efforts of the
Science Mission Directorate's Heliophysics Research Program,⁹ exploring
bodies throughout the Solar System with advanced robotic spacecraft
missions such as New Horizons,¹⁰ and researching astrophysics topics, such
as the Big Bang, through the Great Observatories and associated programs.¹¹
NASA shares data with various national and international organizations such
as from the Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite.

Creation

Main article: Creation of NASA

From 1946, the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) had been
experimenting with rocket planes such as the supersonic Bell X-1.¹² In the
early 1950s, there was challenge to launch an artificial satellite for the
International Geophysical Year (1957–58). An effort for this was the
American Project Vanguard. After the Soviet launch of the world's first
artificial satellite (Sputnik 1) on October 4, 1957, the attention of the
United States turned toward its own fledgling space efforts. The US
Congress, alarmed by the perceived threat to national security and
technological leadership (known as the "Sputnik crisis"), urged immediate
and swift action; President Dwight D. Eisenhower and his advisers counseled
more deliberate measures. This led to an agreement that a new federal
agency mainly based on NACA was needed to conduct all non-military activity
in space. The Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) was created in
February 1958 to develop space technology for military application.¹³

On July 29, 1958, Eisenhower signed the National Aeronautics and Space Act,
establishing NASA. When it began operations on October 1, 1958, NASA
absorbed the 46-year-old NACA intact; its 8,000 employees, an annual budget
of US$100 million, three major research laboratories (Langley Aeronautical
Laboratory, Ames Aeronautical Laboratory, and Lewis Flight Propulsion
Laboratory) and two small test facilities.¹⁴ A NASA seal was approved by
President Eisenhower in 1959.¹⁵ Elements of the Army Ballistic Missile
Agency and the United States Naval Research Laboratory were incorporated
into NASA. A significant contributor to NASA's entry into the Space Race
with the Soviet Union was the technology from the German rocket program led
by Wernher von Braun, who was now working for the Army Ballistic Missile
Agency (ABMA), which in turn incorporated the technology of American
scientist Robert Goddard's earlier works.¹⁶ Earlier research efforts within
the US Air Force¹⁴ and many of ARPA's early space programs were also
transferred to NASA.¹⁷ In December 1958, NASA gained control of the Jet
Propulsion Laboratory, a contractor facility operated by the California
Institute of Technology.¹⁴

Space flight programs

Main article: List of NASA missions

NASA has conducted many manned and unmanned spaceflight programs throughout
its history. Unmanned programs launched the first American artificial
satellites into Earth orbit for scientific and communications purposes, and
sent scientific probes to explore the planets of the solar system, starting
with Venus and Mars, and including "grand tours" of the outer planets.
Manned programs sent the first Americans into low Earth orbit (LEO), won
the Space Race with the Soviet Union by landing twelve men on the Moon from
1969 to 1972 in the Apollo program, developed a semi-reusable LEO Space
Shuttle, and developed LEO space station capability by itself and with the
cooperation of several other nations including post-Soviet Russia. Some
missions include both manned and unmanned aspects, such as the Galileo
probe, which was deployed by astronauts in Earth orbit before being sent
unmanned to Jupiter.

Manned programs

The experimental rocket-powered aircraft programs started by NACA were
extended by NASA as support for manned spaceflight. This was followed by a
one-man space capsule program, and in turn by a two-man capsule program.
Reacting to loss of national prestige and security fears caused by early
leads in space exploration by the Soviet Union, in 1961 President John F.
Kennedy proposed the ambitious goal "of landing a man on the Moon by the
end of [the 60s], and returning him safely to the Earth." This goal was met
in 1969 by the Apollo program, and NASA planned even more ambitious
activities leading to a manned mission to Mars. However, reduction of the
perceived threat and changing political priorities almost immediately
caused the termination of most of these plans. NASA turned its attention to
an Apollo-derived temporary space laboratory, and a semi-reusable Earth
orbital shuttle. In the 1990s, funding was approved for NASA to develop a
permanent Earth orbital space station in cooperation with the international
community, which now included the former rival, post-Soviet Russia. To
date, NASA has launched a total of 166 manned space missions on rockets,
and thirteen X-15 rocket flights above the USAF definition of spaceflight
altitude, 260,000 feet (80 km).¹⁸

X-15 rocket plane (1959–68)

Main article: North American X-15

The X-15 was an NACA experimental rocket-powered hypersonic research
aircraft, developed in conjunction with the US Air Force and Navy. The
design featured a slender fuselage with fairings along the side containing
fuel and early computerized control systems.¹⁹ Requests for proposal were
issued on December 30, 1954 for the airframe, and February 4, 1955 for the
rocket engine. The airframe contract was awarded to North American Aviation
in November 1955, and the XLR30 engine contract was awarded to Reaction
Motors in 1956, and three planes were built. The X-15 was drop-launched
from the wing of one of two NASA Boeing B-52 Stratofortresses, NB52A tail
number 52-003, and NB52B, tail number 52-008 (known as the Balls 8).
Release took place at an altitude of about 45,000 feet (14 km) and a speed
of about 500 miles per hour (805 km/h).

Twelve pilots were selected for the program from the Air Force, Navy, and
NACA (later NASA). A total of 199 flights were made between 1959 and 1968,
resulting in the official world record for the highest speed ever reached
by a manned powered aircraft (current as of 2014), and a maximum speed of
Mach 6.72, 4,519 miles per hour (7,273 km/h).²⁰ The altitude record for
X-15 was 354,200 feet (107.96 km).²¹ Eight of the pilots were awarded Air
Force astronaut wings for flying above 260,000 feet (80 km), and two
flights by Joseph A. Walker exceeded 100 kilometers (330,000 ft),
qualifying as spaceflight according to the International Aeronautical
Federation. The X-15 program employed mechanical techniques used in the
later manned spaceflight programs, including reaction control system jets
for controlling the orientation of a spacecraft, space suits, and horizon
definition for navigation.²¹ The reentry and landing data collected were
valuable to NASA for designing the Space Shuttle.¹⁹

Project Mercury (1959–63)

Main article: Project Mercury
Friendship 7, first US manned orbital spaceflight
Mercury-Atlas 6 launch on February 20, 1962
Still frame of John Glenn in orbit from camera inside Friendship 7

Shortly after the Space Race began, an early objective was to get a person
into Earth orbit as soon as possible, therefore the simplest spacecraft
that could be launched by existing rockets was favored. The US Air Force's
Man in Space Soonest program considered many manned spacecraft designs,
ranging from rocket planes like the X-15, to small ballistic space
capsules.²² By 1958, the space plane concepts were eliminated in favor of
the ballistic capsule.²³

When NASA was created that same year, the Air Force program was transferred
to it and renamed Project Mercury. The first seven astronauts were selected
among candidates from the Navy, Air Force and Marine test pilot programs.
On May 5, 1961, astronaut Alan Shepard became the first American in space
aboard Freedom 7, launched by a Redstone booster on a 15-minute ballistic
(suborbital) flight.²⁴ John Glenn became the first American to be launched
into orbit by an Atlas launch vehicle on February 20, 1962 aboard
Friendship 7.²⁵ Glenn completed three orbits, after which three more
orbital flights were made, culminating in L. Gordon Cooper's 22-orbit
flight Faith 7, May 15–16, 1963.²⁶

The Soviet Union (USSR) competed with its own single-pilot spacecraft,
Vostok. They sent the first man in space, by launching cosmonaut Yuri
Gagarin into a single Earth orbit aboard Vostok 1 in April 1961, one month
before Shepard's flight.²⁷ In August 1962, they achieved an almost four-day
record flight with Andriyan Nikolayev aboard Vostok 3, and also conducted a
concurrent Vostok 4 mission carrying Pavel Popovich.

Project Gemini (1961–66)

Main article: Project Gemini

Based on studies to grow the Mercury spacecraft capabilities to
long-duration flights, developing space rendezvous techniques, and
precision Earth landing, Project Gemini was started as a two-man program in
1962 to overcome the Soviets' lead and to support the Apollo manned lunar
landing program, adding extravehicular activity (EVA) and rendezvous and
docking to its objectives. The first manned Gemini flight, Gemini 3, was
flown by Gus Grissom and John Young on March 23, 1965.²⁸ Nine missions
followed in 1965 and 1966, demonstrating an endurance mission of nearly
fourteen days, rendezvous, docking, and practical EVA, and gathering
medical data on the effects of weightlessness on humans.²⁹ ³⁰

Under the direction of Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev, the USSR competed
with Gemini by converting their Vostok spacecraft into a two- or three-man
Voskhod. They succeeded in launching two manned flights before Gemini's
first flight, achieving a three-cosmonaut flight in 1963 and the first EVA
in 1964. After this, the program was canceled, and Gemini caught up while
spacecraft designer Sergei Korolev developed the Soyuz spacecraft, their
answer to Apollo.

Project Apollo (1961–72)

Main article: Apollo program

The U.S public's perception of the Soviet lead in putting the first man in
space, motivated President John F. Kennedy to ask the Congress on May 25,
1961 to commit the federal government to a program to land a man on the
Moon by the end of the 1960s, which effectively launched the Apollo
program.³¹

Apollo was one of the most expensive American scientific programs ever. It
cost more than $20 billion in 1960s dollars³² or an estimated $205 billion
in present-day US dollars.³³ (In comparison, the Manhattan Project cost
roughly $26.2 billion, accounting for inflation.)³³ ³⁴ It used the Saturn
rockets as launch vehicles, which were far bigger than the rockets built
for previous projects.³⁵ The spacecraft was also bigger; it had two main
parts, the combined command and service module (CSM) and the lunar landing
module (LM). The LM was to be left on the Moon and only the command module
(CM) containing the three astronauts would eventually return to Earth.

The second manned mission, Apollo 8, brought astronauts for the first time
in a flight around the Moon in December 1968.³⁶ Shortly before, the Soviets
had sent an unmanned spacecraft around the Moon.³⁷ On the next two missions
docking maneuvers that were needed for the Moon landing were practiced³⁸ ³⁹
and then finally the Moon landing was made on the Apollo 11 mission in July
1969.⁴⁰

The first person to stand on the Moon was Neil Armstrong, who was followed
by Buzz Aldrin, while Michael Collins orbited above. Five subsequent Apollo
missions also landed astronauts on the Moon, the last in December 1972.
Throughout these six Apollo spaceflights, twelve men walked on the Moon.
These missions returned a wealth of scientific data and 381.7 kilograms
(842 lb) of lunar samples. Topics covered by experiments performed included
soil mechanics, meteoroids, seismology, heat flow, lunar ranging, magnetic
fields, and solar wind.⁴¹ The Moon landing marked the end of the space
race; and as a gesture, Armstrong mentioned mankind when he stepped down on
the Moon.⁴²

Apollo set major milestones in human spaceflight. It stands alone in
sending manned missions beyond low Earth orbit, and landing humans on
another celestial body.⁴³ Apollo 8 was the first manned spacecraft to orbit
another celestial body, while Apollo 17 marked the last moonwalk and the
last manned mission beyond low Earth orbit to date. The program spurred
advances in many areas of technology peripheral to rocketry and manned
spaceflight, including avionics, telecommunications, and computers. Apollo
sparked interest in many fields of engineering and left many physical
facilities and machines developed for the program as landmarks. Many
objects and artifacts from the program are on display at various locations
throughout the world, notably at the Smithsonian's Air and Space Museums.

Skylab (1965–79)

Main article: Skylab

Skylab was the United States' first and only independently built space
station.⁴⁴ Conceived in 1965 as a workshop to be constructed in space from
a spent Saturn IB upper stage, the 169,950 lb (77,088 kg) station was
constructed on Earth and launched on May 14, 1973 atop the first two stages
of a Saturn V, into a 235-nautical-mile (435 km) orbit inclined at 50° to
the equator. Damaged during launch by the loss of its thermal protection
and one electricity-generating solar panel, it was repaired to
functionality by its first crew. It was occupied for a total of 171 days by
3 successive crews in 1973 and 1974.⁴⁴ It included a laboratory for
studying the effects of microgravity, and a solar observatory.⁴⁴ NASA
planned to have a Space Shuttle dock with it, and elevate Skylab to a
higher safe altitude, but the Shuttle was not ready for flight before
Skylab's re-entry on July 11, 1979.⁴⁵

To save cost, NASA used one of the Saturn V rockets originally earmarked
for a canceled Apollo mission to launch the Skylab. Apollo spacecraft were
used for transporting astronauts to and from the station. Three three-man
crews stayed aboard the station for periods of 28, 59, and 84 days.
Skylab's habitable volume was 11,290 cubic feet (320 m³), which was 30.7
times bigger than that of the Apollo Command Module.⁴⁵

Apollo-Soyuz Test Project (1972–75)

Main article: Apollo-Soyuz Test Project

On May 24, 1972, US President Richard M. Nixon and Soviet Premier Alexei
Kosygin signed an agreement calling for a joint manned space mission, and
declaring intent for all future international manned spacecraft to be
capable of docking with each other.⁴⁶ This authorized the Apollo-Soyuz Test
Project (ASTP), involving the rendezvous and docking in Earth orbit of a
surplus Apollo Command/Service Module with a Soyuz spacecraft. The mission
took place in July 1975. This was the last US manned space flight until the
first orbital flight of the Space Shuttle in April 1981.⁴⁷

The mission included both joint and separate scientific experiments, and
provided useful engineering experience for future joint US–Russian space
flights, such as the Shuttle–Mir Program⁴⁸ and the International Space
Station.

Space Shuttle program (1972–2011)

Main article: Space Shuttle program

The Space Shuttle became the major focus of NASA in the late 1970s and the
1980s. Planned as a frequently launchable and mostly reusable vehicle, four
space shuttle orbiters were built by 1985. The first to launch, Columbia,
did so on April 12, 1981,⁴⁹ the 20th anniversary of the first known human
space flight.⁵⁰

Its major components were a spaceplane orbiter with an external fuel tank
and two solid-fuel launch rockets at its side. The external tank, which was
bigger than the spacecraft itself, was the only major component that was
not reused. The shuttle could orbit in altitudes of 185–643 km (115–400
miles)⁵¹ and carry a maximum payload (to low orbit) of 24,400 kg (54,000
lb).⁵² Missions could last from 5 to 17 days and crews could be from 2 to 8
astronauts.⁵¹

On 20 missions (1983–98) the Space Shuttle carried Spacelab, designed in
cooperation with the European Space Agency (ESA). Spacelab was not designed
for independent orbital flight, but remained in the Shuttle's cargo bay as
the astronauts entered and left it through an airlock.⁵³ Another famous
series of missions were the launch and later successful repair of the
Hubble Space Telescope in 1990 and 1993, respectively.⁵⁴

In 1995, Russian-American interaction resumed with the Shuttle-Mir missions
(1995–1998). Once more an American vehicle docked with a Russian craft,
this time a full-fledged space station. This cooperation has continued with
Russia and the United States as two of the biggest partners in the largest
space station built: the International Space Station (ISS). The strength of
their cooperation on this project was even more evident when NASA began
relying on Russian launch vehicles to service the ISS during the two-year
grounding of the shuttle fleet following the 2003 Space Shuttle Columbia
disaster.

and landing

The Shuttle fleet lost two orbiters and 14 astronauts in two disasters:
Challenger in 1986, and Columbia in 2003.⁵⁵ While the 1986 loss was
mitigated by building the Space Shuttle Endeavour from replacement parts,
NASA did not build another orbiter to replace the second loss.⁵⁵ NASA's
Space Shuttle program had 135 missions when the program ended with the
successful landing of the Space Shuttle Atlantis at the Kennedy Space
Center on July 21, 2011. The program spanned 30 years with over 300
astronauts sent into space.⁵⁶

International Space Station (1993–present)

Main article: International Space Station

The International Space Station (ISS) combines NASA's Space Station Freedom
project with the Soviet/Russian Mir-2 station, the European Columbus
station, and the Japanese Kibō laboratory module.⁵⁷ NASA originally planned
in the 1980s to develop Freedom alone, but US budget constraints led to the
merger of these projects into a single multi-national program in 1993,
managed by NASA, the Russian Federal Space Agency (RKA), the Japan
Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), the European Space Agency (ESA), and
the Canadian Space Agency (CSA).⁵⁸ ⁵⁹ The station consists of pressurized
modules, external trusses, solar arrays and other components, which have
been launched by Russian Proton and Soyuz rockets, and the US Space
Shuttles.⁵⁷ It is currently being assembled in Low Earth Orbit. The
on-orbit assembly began in 1998, the completion of the US Orbital Segment
occurred in 2011 and the completion of the Russian Orbital Segment is
expected by 2016.⁶⁰ ⁶¹ The ownership and use of the space station is
established in intergovernmental treaties and agreements⁶² which divide the
station into two areas and allow Russia to retain full ownership of the
Russian Orbital Segment (with the exception of Zarya),⁶³ ⁶⁴ with the US
Orbital Segment allocated between the other international partners.⁶²

Long duration missions to the ISS are referred to as ISS Expeditions.
Expedition crew members typically spend approximately six months on the
ISS.⁶⁵ The initial expedition crew size was three, temporarily decreased to
two following the Columbia disaster. Since May 2009, expedition crew size
has been six crew members.⁶⁶ Crew size is expected to be increased to
seven, the number the ISS was designed for, once the Commercial Crew
Program becomes operational.⁶⁷ The ISS has been continuously occupied for
the past 14 years and 337 days, having exceeded the previous record held by
Mir; and has been visited by astronauts and cosmonauts from 15 different
nations.⁶⁸ ⁶⁹

The station can be seen from the Earth with the naked eye and, as of 2015,
is the largest artificial satellite in Earth orbit with a mass and volume
greater than that of any previous space station.⁷⁰ The Soyuz spacecraft
delivers crew members, stays docked for their half-year-long missions and
then returns them home. Several uncrewed cargo spacecraft service the ISS,
they are the Russian Progress spacecraft which has done so since 2000, the
European Automated Transfer Vehicle (ATV) since 2008, the Japanese H-II
Transfer Vehicle (HTV) since 2009, the American Dragon spacecraft since
2012, and the American Cygnus spacecraft since 2013. The Space Shuttle,
before its retirement, was also used for cargo transfer and would often
switch out expedition crew members, although it did not have the capability
to remain docked for the duration of their stay. Until another US manned
spacecraft is ready, crew members will travel to and from the International
Space Station exclusively aboard the Soyuz.⁷¹ The highest number of people
occupying the ISS has been thirteen; this occurred three times during the
late Shuttle ISS assembly missions.⁷²

The ISS program is expected to continue until at least 2020, and may be
extended beyond 2028.⁷³

Commercial Resupply Services (2006–present)

Main article: Commercial Resupply Services

The development of the Commercial Resupply Services (CRS) vehicles began in
2006 with the purpose of creating American commercially operated uncrewed
cargo vehicles to service the ISS.⁷⁴ The development of these vehicles was
under a fixed price milestone-based program, meaning that each company that
received a funded award had a list of milestones with a dollar value
attached to them that they didn't receive until after they had successful
completed the milestone.⁷⁵ Private companies were also required to have
some "skin in the game" which refers raising an unspecified amount of
private investment for their proposal.⁷⁶

On December 23, 2008, NASA awarded Commercial Resupply Services contracts
to SpaceX and Orbital Sciences Corporation.⁷⁷ SpaceX uses its Falcon 9
rocket and Dragon spacecraft.⁷⁸ Orbital Sciences uses its Antares rocket
and Cygnus spacecraft. The first Dragon resupply mission occurred in May
2012.⁷⁹ The first Cygnus resupply mission occurred in September 2013.⁸⁰ The
CRS program now provides for all America's ISS cargo needs; with the
exception of a few vehicle-specific payloads that are delivered on the
European ATV and the Japanese HTV.⁸¹

Commercial Crew Program (2010–present)

Main article: Commercial Crew Development

The Commercial Crew Development (CCDev) program was initiated in 2010 with
the purpose of creating American commercially operated crewed spacecraft
capable of delivering at least four crew members to the ISS, staying docked
for 180 days and then returning them back to Earth.⁸² It is hoped that
these vehicles could also transport non-NASA customers to private space
stations such those planned by Bigelow Aerospace.⁸³ Like COTS, CCDev is
also a fixed price milestone-based developmental program that requires some
private investment.⁷⁵

In 2010, NASA announced the winners of the first phase of the program, a
total of $50 million was divided among five American companies to foster
research and development into human spaceflight concepts and technologies
in the private sector. In 2011, the winners of the second phase of the
program were announced, $270 million was divided among four companies.⁸⁴ In
2012, the winners of the third phase of the program were announced, NASA
provided $1.1 billion divided among three companies to further develop
their crew transportation systems.⁸⁵ In 2014, the winners of the final
round were announced.⁸⁶ SpaceX's Dragon V2 (planned to be launched on a
Falcon 9 v1.1) received a contract valued up to $2.6 billion and Boeing's
CST-100 (to be launched on an Atlas V) received a contract valued up to
$4.2 billion.⁸⁷ NASA expects these vehicles to begin transporting humans to
the ISS in 2017.⁸⁷

Beyond Low Earth Orbit program (2010–present)

For missions beyond low Earth orbit (BLEO), NASA has been directed to
develop the Space Launch System (SLS), a Saturn-V class rocket, and the two
to six person, beyond low Earth orbit spacecraft, Orion. In February 2010,
President Barack Obama's administration proposed eliminating public funds
for the Constellation program and shifting greater responsibility of
servicing the ISS to private companies.⁸⁸ During a speech at the Kennedy
Space Center on April 15, 2010, Obama proposed a new heavy-lift vehicle
(HLV) to replace the formerly planned Ares V.⁸⁹ In his speech, Obama called
for a manned mission to an asteroid as soon as 2025, and a manned mission
to Mars orbit by the mid-2030s.⁸⁹ The NASA Authorization Act of 2010 was
passed by Congress and signed into law on October 11, 2010.⁹⁰ The act
officially canceled the Constellation program.⁹⁰

The Authorization Act required a newly designed HLV be chosen within 90
days of its passing; the launch vehicle was given the name "Space Launch
System". The new law also required the construction of a beyond low earth
orbit spacecraft.⁹¹ The Orion spacecraft, which was being developed as part
of the Constellation program, was chosen to fulfill this role.⁹² The Space
Launch System is planned to launch both Orion and other necessary hardware
for missions beyond low Earth orbit.⁹³ The SLS is to be upgraded over time
with more powerful versions. The initial capability of SLS is required to
be able to lift 70 mt into LEO. It is then planned to be upgraded to 105 mt
and then eventually to 130 mt.⁹² ⁹⁴

Exploration Flight Test 1 (EFT-1), an unmanned test flight of Orion's crew
module, was launched on December 5, 2014, atop a Delta IV Heavy rocket.⁹⁴
Exploration Mission-1 (EM-1) is the unmanned initial launch of SLS that
would also send Orion on a circumlunar trajectory, which is planned for
2017.⁹⁴ The first manned flight of Orion and SLS, Exploration Mission 2
(EM-2) is to launch between 2019 and 2021; it is a 10- to 14-day mission
planned to place a crew of four into Lunar orbit.⁹⁴ As of March 2012, the
destination for EM-3 and the intermediate focus for this new program is
still in-flux.⁹⁵

Unmanned programs

Main article: Unmanned NASA missions

More than 1,000 unmanned missions have been designed to explore the Earth
and the solar system.⁹⁶ Besides exploration, communication satellites have
also been launched by NASA.⁹⁷ The missions have been launched directly from
Earth or from orbiting space shuttles, which could either deploy the
satellite itself, or with a rocket stage to take it farther.

The first US unmanned satellite was Explorer 1, which started as an
ABMA/JPL project during the early part of the Space Race. It was launched
in January 1958, two months after Sputnik. At the creation of NASA the
Explorer project was transferred to this agency and still continues to this
day. Its missions have been focusing on the Earth and the Sun, measuring
magnetic fields and the solar wind, among other aspects.⁹⁸ A more recent
Earth mission, not related to the Explorer program, was the Hubble Space
Telescope, which as mentioned above was brought into orbit in 1990.⁹⁹

The inner Solar System has been made the goal of at least four unmanned
programs. The first was Mariner in the 1960s and '70s, which made multiple
visits to Venus and Mars and one to Mercury. Probes launched under the
Mariner program were also the first to make a planetary flyby (Mariner 2),
to take the first pictures from another planet (Mariner 4), the first
planetary orbiter (Mariner 9), and the first to make a gravity assist
maneuver (Mariner 10). This is a technique where the satellite takes
advantage of the gravity and velocity of planets to reach its
destination.¹⁰⁰

The first successful landing on Mars was made by Viking 1 in 1976. Twenty
years later a rover was landed on Mars by Mars Pathfinder.¹⁰¹

Outside Mars, Jupiter was first visited by Pioneer 10 in 1973. More than 20
years later Galileo sent a probe into the planet's atmosphere, and became
the first spacecraft to orbit the planet.¹⁰² Pioneer 11 became the first
spacecraft to visit Saturn in 1979, with Voyager 2 making the first (and so
far only) visits to Uranus and Neptune in 1986 and 1989, respectively. The
first spacecraft to leave the solar system was Pioneer 10 in 1983. For a
time it was the most distant spacecraft, but it has since been surpassed by
both Voyager 1 and Voyager 2.¹⁰³

Pioneers 10 and 11 and both Voyager probes carry messages from the Earth to
extraterrestrial life.¹⁰⁴ ¹⁰⁵ Communication can be difficult with deep
space travel. For instance, it took about 3 hours for a radio signal to
reach the New Horizons spacecraft when it was more than halfway to
Pluto.¹⁰⁶ Contact with Pioneer 10 was lost in 2003. Both Voyager probes
continue to operate as they explore the outer boundary between the Solar
System and interstellar space.¹⁰⁷

On November 26, 2011, NASA's Mars Science Laboratory mission was
successfully launched for Mars. Curiosity successfully landed on Mars on
August 6, 2012, and subsequently began its search for evidence of past or
present life on Mars.¹⁰⁸ ¹⁰⁹ ¹¹⁰

Recent and planned activities

NASA's ongoing investigations include in-depth surveys of Mars and Saturn
and studies of the Earth and the Sun. Other active spacecraft missions are
MESSENGER for Mercury, New Horizons (for Jupiter, Pluto, and beyond), and
Dawn for the asteroid belt. NASA continued to support in situ exploration
beyond the asteroid belt, including Pioneer and Voyager traverses into the
unexplored trans-Pluto region, and Gas Giant orbiters Galileo (1989–2003),
Cassini (1997–), and Juno (2011–).

The New Horizons mission to Pluto was launched in 2006 and successfully
performed a flyby of Pluto on July 14, 2015. The probe received a gravity
assist from Jupiter in February 2007, examining some of Jupiter's inner
moons and testing on-board instruments during the flyby. On the horizon of
NASA's plans is the MAVEN spacecraft as part of the Mars Scout Program to
study the atmosphere of Mars.¹¹¹

On December 4, 2006, NASA announced it was planning a permanent moon
base.¹¹² The goal was to start building the moon base by 2020, and by 2024,
have a fully functional base that would allow for crew rotations and
in-situ resource utilization. However, in 2009, the Augustine Committee
found the program to be on a "unsustainable trajectory."¹¹³ In 2010,
President Barack Obama halted existing plans, including the Moon base, and
directed a generic focus on manned missions to asteroids and Mars, as well
as extending support for the International Space Station.¹¹⁴

Since 2011, NASA's strategic goals have been¹¹⁵

- Extend and sustain human activities across the solar system
- Expand scientific understanding of the Earth and the universe
- Create innovative new space technologies
- Advance aeronautics research
- Enable program and institutional capabilities to conduct NASA's
  aeronautics and space activities
- Share NASA with the public, educators, and students to provide
  opportunities to participate

In August 2011, NASA accepted the donation of two space telescopes from the
National Reconnaissance Office. Despite being stored unused, the
instruments are superior to the Hubble Space Telescope.¹¹⁶

In September 2011, NASA announced the start of the Space Launch System
program to develop a human-rated heavy lift vehicle. The Space Launch
System is intended to launch the Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle and other
elements towards the Moon, near-Earth asteroids, and one day Mars.¹¹⁷ The
Orion MPCV is planned for an unmanned test launch on a Delta IV Heavy
rocket around September 2014.¹¹⁸

On August 6, 2012, NASA landed the rover Curiosity on Mars. On August 27,
2012, Curiosity transmitted the first pre-recorded message from the surface
of Mars back to Earth, made by Administrator Charlie Bolden:

Staff and leadership

Main article: List of NASA Administrators

NASA's administrator is the agency's highest-ranking official and serves as
the senior space science adviser to the President of the United States. The
agency's administration is located at NASA Headquarters in Washington, DC
and provides overall guidance and direction.¹²⁰ Except under exceptional
circumstances, NASA civil service employees are required to be citizens of
the United States.¹²¹

The first administrator was Dr. T. Keith Glennan, appointed by President
Dwight D. Eisenhower. During his term he brought together the disparate
projects in American space development research.¹²²

The third administrator was James E. Webb (served 1961–1968), appointed by
President John F. Kennedy. In order to implement the Apollo program to
achieve Kennedy's Moon landing goal by the end of the 1960s, Webb directed
major management restructuring and facility expansion, establishing the
Houston Manned Spacecraft (Johnson) Center and the Florida Launch
Operations (Kennedy) Center.

In 2009, President Barack Obama nominated Charles Bolden as NASA's twelfth
administrator.¹²³ Administrator Bolden is one of three NASA administrators
who were astronauts, along with Richard H. Truly (served 1989–1992) and
Frederick D. Gregory (acting, 2005).

Facilities

Jet Propulsion Laboratory complex in Pasadena, California
Vehicle Assembly and Launch Control at Kennedy Space Center
Main article: NASA facilities

NASA's facilities are research, construction and communication centers to
help its missions. Some facilities serve more than one application for
historic or administrative reasons. NASA also operates a short-line
railroad at the Kennedy Space Center and own special aircraft, for instance
two Boeing 747 that transport Space Shuttle orbiter.

John F. Kennedy Space Center (KSC), is one of the best-known NASA
facilities. It has been the launch site for every United States human space
flight since 1968. Although such flights are currently on pause, KSC
continues to manage and operate unmanned rocket launch facilities for
America's civilian space program from three pads at the adjoining Cape
Canaveral Air Force Station.

Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center (JSC) in Houston is home to the Christopher
C. Kraft Jr. Mission Control Center, where all flight control is managed
for manned space missions. JSC is the lead NASA center for activities
regarding the International Space Station and also houses the NASA
Astronaut Corps that selects, trains, and provides astronauts as crew
members for US and international space missions.

Another major facility is Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville,
Alabama at which the Saturn 5 rocket and Skylab were developed.¹²⁴ The JPL
worked together with ABMA, one of the agencies behind Explorer 1, the first
American space mission.

Budget

Main article: Budget of NASA

NASA's budget has generally been approximately 1% of the federal budget
from the early 1970s on, but briefly peaked to approximately 4.41% in 1966
during the Apollo program.¹²⁵ Public perception of NASA's budget has
differed significantly from reality; a 1997 poll indicated that most
Americans responded that 20% of the federal budget went to NASA.¹²⁶

The percentage of federal budget that NASA has been allocated has been
steadily dropping since the Apollo program and in 2012 it was estimated at
0.48% of the federal budget.¹²⁷ In a March 2012 meeting of the United
States Senate Science Committee, Neil deGrasse Tyson testified that "Right
now, NASA's annual budget is half a penny on your tax dollar. For twice
that—a penny on a dollar—we can transform the country from a sullen,
dispirited nation, weary of economic struggle, to one where it has
reclaimed its 20th century birthright to dream of tomorrow."¹²⁸ ¹²⁹

For Fiscal Year 2015, NASA received an appropriation of US$18.01 billion
from Congress—$549 million more than requested and approximately $350
million more than the 2014 NASA budget passed by Congress.¹³⁰

Environmental impact

The environmental consequences of space exploration adversely effect the
Earth. Some hypergolic rocket propellants, such as hydrazine, are extremely
toxic prior to combustion. Rockets based on hydrocarbons, such as kerosene,
release carbon dioxide and soot in their exhaust.¹³¹ However, rocket
emissions are insignificant compared to those from automobiles or
coal-fired power plants, as they are much less frequent. Additionally, the
exhaust from LOx- and LH2- fueled engines, like the SSME, is almost
entirely water vapor.¹³² NASA addressed environmental concerns with its
canceled Constellation program in accordance with the National
Environmental Policy Act in 2011.¹³³

On May 8, 2003, Environmental Protection Agency recognized NASA as the
first federal agency to directly use landfill gas to produce energy at one
of its facilities—the Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Maryland.¹³⁴

An example of the NASA environmental execution is the NASA Sustainability
Base. Additionally, the Exploration Sciences Building was awarded the LEED
Gold rating.¹³⁵

Nebula

For other uses, see Nebula (disambiguation).

A nebula (Latin for "cloud";² pl. nebulae, nebulæ, or nebulas) is an
interstellar cloud of dust, hydrogen, helium and other ionized gases.
Originally, nebula was a name for any diffuse astronomical object,
including galaxies beyond the Milky Way. The Andromeda Galaxy, for
instance, was referred to as the Andromeda Nebula (and spiral galaxies in
general as "spiral nebulae") before the true nature of galaxies was
confirmed in the early 20th century by Vesto Slipher, Edwin Hubble and
others.

Most nebulae are of vast size, even hundreds of light years in diameter.³
Although denser than the space surrounding them, most nebulae are far less
dense than any vacuum created in an Earthen environment - a nebular cloud
the size of the Earth would have a total mass of only a few kilograms.
Nebulae are often star-forming regions, such as in the "Pillars of
Creation" in the Eagle Nebula. In these regions the formations of gas,
dust, and other materials "clump" together to form larger masses, which
attract further matter, and eventually will become massive enough to form
stars. The remaining materials are then believed to form planets and other
planetary system objects.

Observational history

Around 150 AD, Claudius Ptolemaeus (Ptolemy) recorded, in books VII-VIII of
his Almagest, five stars that appeared nebulous. He also noted a region of
nebulosity between the constellations Ursa Major and Leo that was not
associated with any star.⁴ The first true nebula, as distinct from a star
cluster, was mentioned by the Persian/Muslim astronomer, Abd al-Rahman
al-Sufi, in his Book of Fixed Stars (964).⁵ He noted "a little cloud" where
the Andromeda Galaxy is located.⁶ He also cataloged the Omicron Velorum
star cluster as a "nebulous star" and other nebulous objects, such as
Brocchi's Cluster.⁵ The supernova that created the Crab Nebula, the SN
1054, was observed by Arabic and Chinese astronomers in 1054.⁷ ⁸

In 1610, Nicolas-Claude Fabri de Peiresc discovered the Orion Nebula using
a telescope. This nebula was also observed by Johann Baptist Cysat in 1618.
However, the first detailed study of the Orion Nebula wouldn't be performed
until 1659 by Christiaan Huygens, who also believed himself to be the first
person to discover this nebulosity.⁶

In 1715, Edmund Halley published a list of six nebulae.⁹ This number
steadily increased during the century, with Jean-Philippe de Cheseaux
compiling a list of 20 (including eight not previously known) in 1746. From
1751–53, Nicolas Louis de Lacaille cataloged 42 nebulae from the Cape of
Good Hope, with most of them being previously unknown. Charles Messier then
compiled a catalog of 103 "nebulae" (now called Messier objects, which
included what are now known to be galaxies) by 1781; his interest was
detecting comets, and these were objects that might be mistaken for them.¹⁰

The number of nebulae was then greatly expanded by the efforts of William
Herschel and his sister Caroline Herschel. Their Catalogue of One Thousand
New Nebulae and Clusters of Stars was published in 1786. A second catalog
of a thousand was published in 1789 and the third and final catalog of 510
appeared in 1802. During much of their work, William Herschel believed that
these nebulae were merely unresolved clusters of stars. In 1790, however,
he discovered a star surrounded by nebulosity and concluded that this was a
true nebulosity, rather than a more distant cluster.¹⁰

Beginning in 1864, William Huggins examined the spectra of about 70
nebulae. He found that roughly a third of them had the emission spectrum of
a gas. The rest showed a continuous spectrum and thus were thought to
consist of a mass of stars.¹¹ ¹² A third category was added in 1912 when
Vesto Slipher showed that the spectrum of the nebula that surrounded the
star Merope matched the spectra of the Pleiades open cluster. Thus the
nebula radiates by reflected star light.¹³

In about 1922, following the Great Debate, it had become clear that many
"nebulae" were in fact galaxies far from our own.

Slipher and Edwin Hubble continued to collect the spectra from many diffuse
nebulae, finding 29 that showed emission spectra and 33 had the continuous
spectra of star light.¹² In 1922, Hubble announced that nearly all nebulae
are associated with stars, and their illumination comes from star light. He
also discovered that the emission spectrum nebulae are nearly always
associated with stars having spectral classifications of B1 or hotter
(including all O-type main sequence stars), while nebulae with continuous
spectra appear with cooler stars.¹⁴ Both Hubble and Henry Norris Russell
concluded that the nebulae surrounding the hotter stars are transformed in
some manner.¹²

Formation

Many nebulae or stars form from the gravitational collapse of gas in the
interstellar medium or ISM. As the material collapses under its own weight,
massive stars may form in the center, and their ultraviolet radiation
ionizes the surrounding gas, making it visible at optical wavelengths.
Examples of these types of nebulae are the Rosette Nebula and the Pelican
Nebula. The size of these nebulae, known as HII regions, varies depending
on the size of the original cloud of gas. New stars are formed in the
nebulae. The formed stars are sometimes known as a young, loose cluster.

Some nebulae are formed as the result of supernova explosions, the death
throes of massive, short-lived stars. The materials thrown off from the
supernova explosion are ionized by the energy and the compact object that
it can produce. One of the best examples of this is the Crab Nebula, in
Taurus. The supernova event was recorded in the year 1054 and is labelled
SN 1054. The compact object that was created after the explosion lies in
the center of the Crab Nebula and is a neutron star.

Other nebulae may form as planetary nebulae. This is the final stage of a
low-mass star's life, like Earth's Sun. Stars with a mass up to 8–10 solar
masses evolve into red giants and slowly lose their outer layers during
pulsations in their atmospheres. When a star has lost enough material, its
temperature increases and the ultraviolet radiation it emits can ionize the
surrounding nebula that it has thrown off.

Classical types

Objects named nebulae belong to four major groups. Before their nature was
understood, galaxies ("spiral nebulae") and star clusters too distant to be
resolved as stars were also classified as nebulae, but no longer are.

- H II regions, large diffuse nebulae containing ionized hydrogen
- Planetary nebulae
- Supernova remnant (e.g., Crab Nebula)
- Dark nebula

Not all cloud-like structures are named nebulae; Herbig–Haro objects are an
example.

Diffuse nebulae

Most nebulae can be described as diffuse nebulae, which means that they are
extended and contain no well-defined boundaries.¹⁵ In visible light these
nebulae may be divided into emission and reflection nebulae. Emission
nebulae emit spectral line radiation from ionized gas (mostly ionized
hydrogen);¹⁶ they are often called HII regions (the term "HII" is used in
professional astronomy to refer to ionized hydrogen).

Reflection nebulae themselves do not emit significant amounts of visible
light, but are near stars and reflect light from them.¹⁶ Similar nebulae
not illuminated by stars do not exhibit visible radiation, but may be
detected as opaque clouds blocking light from luminous objects behind them;
they are called "dark nebulae".¹⁶

Although these nebulae have different visibility at optical wavelengths,
they are all bright sources of infrared emission, chiefly from dust within
the nebulae.¹⁶

Planetary nebulae

Main article: Planetary nebula

Planetary nebulae form from the gaseous shells that are ejected from
low-mass asymptotic giant branch stars when they transform into white
dwarfs.¹⁶ They are emission nebulae with spectra similar to those of
emission nebulae found in star formation regions.¹⁶ Technically they are
HII regions, because most hydrogen will be ionized, but they are denser and
more compact than the nebulae in star formation regions.¹⁶ Planetary
nebulae were given their name by the first astronomical observers who
became able to distinguish them from planets, who tended to confuse them
with planets, of more interest to them. Our Sun is expected to spawn a
planetary nebula about 12 billion years after its formation.¹⁷

Protoplanetary nebula

Main article: Protoplanetary nebula

A protoplanetary nebula (PPN) is an astronomical object which is at the
short-lived episode during a star's rapid stellar evolution between the
late asymptotic giant branch (LAGB) phase and the following planetary
nebula (PN) phase.¹⁸ During the AGB phase, the star undergoes mass loss,
emitting a circumstellar shell of hydrogen gas. When this phase comes to an
end, the star enters the PPN phase.

The PPN is energized by the central star, causing it to emit strong
infrared radiation and become a reflection nebula. Collaminated stellar
winds from the central star shape and shock the shell into an axially
symmetric form, while producing a fast moving molecular wind.¹⁹ The exact
point when a PPN becomes a planetary nebula (PN) is defined by the
temperature of the central star. The PPN phase continues until the central
star reaches a temperature of 30,000 K, after which is it hot enough to
ionize the surrounding gas.²⁰

Supernova remnants

A supernova occurs when a high-mass star reaches the end of its life. When
nuclear fusion in the core of the star stops, the star collapses. The gas
falling inward either rebounds or gets so strongly heated that it expands
outwards from the core, thus causing the star to explode.¹⁶ The expanding
shell of gas forms a supernova remnant, a special diffuse nebula.¹⁶
Although much of the optical and X-ray emission from supernova remnants
originates from ionized gas, a great amount of the radio emission is a form
of non-thermal emission called synchrotron emission.¹⁶ This emission
originates from high-velocity electrons oscillating within magnetic fields.

Neutrino

For other uses, see Neutrino (disambiguation).

A neutrino (/nuːˈtriːnoʊ/ or /njuːˈtriːnoʊ/, in Italian [nɛuˈtrino]) is an
electrically neutral elementary particle⁴ with half-integer spin. The
neutrino (meaning "little neutral one" in Italian) is denoted by the Greek
letter ν (nu). All evidence suggests that neutrinos have mass but that
their masses are tiny, even compared to other subatomic particles. They are
the only identified candidate for dark matter, specifically hot dark
matter.⁵

Neutrinos are leptons, along with the charged electrons, muons, and taus,
and come in three flavors: electron neutrinos (ν
e), muon neutrinos (ν
μ), and tau neutrinos (ν
τ). Each flavor is also associated with an antiparticle, called an
"antineutrino", which also has no electric charge and half-integer spin.
Neutrinos are produced in a way that conserves lepton number; i.e., for
every electron neutrino produced, a positron (anti-electron) is produced,
and for every electron antineutrino produced, an electron is produced as
well.

Neutrinos do not carry any electric charge, which means that they are not
affected by the electromagnetic force that acts on charged particles, and
are leptons, so they are not affected by the strong force that acts on
particles inside atomic nuclei. Neutrinos are therefore affected only by
the weak subatomic force and by gravity. The weak force is a very
short-range interaction, and gravity is extremely weak on the subatomic
scale. Thus, neutrinos typically pass through normal matter unimpeded and
undetected.

Neutrinos can be created in several ways, including in certain types of
radioactive decay, in nuclear reactions such as those that take place in
the Sun, in nuclear reactors, when cosmic rays hit atoms and in supernovas.
The majority of neutrinos in the vicinity of the earth are from nuclear
reactions in the Sun. In fact, about 65 billion (6.5×10¹⁰) solar neutrinos
per second pass through every square centimeter perpendicular to the
direction of the Sun in the region of the Earth.⁶

Neutrinos are now understood to oscillate between different flavors in
flight. That is, an electron neutrino produced in a beta decay reaction may
arrive in a detector as a muon or tau neutrino. This oscillation requires
that the different neutrino flavors have different masses, although these
masses have been shown to be tiny. From cosmological measurements, we know
that the sum of the three neutrino masses must be less than one millionth
that of the electron.⁷

History

Pauli's proposal

The neutrino[nb 1] was postulated first by Wolfgang Pauli in 1930 to
explain how beta decay could conserve energy, momentum, and angular
momentum (spin). In contrast to Niels Bohr, who proposed a statistical
version of the conservation laws to explain the event, Pauli hypothesized
an undetected particle that he called a "neutron" in keeping with
convention employed for naming both the proton and the electron, which in
1930 were known to be respective products for alpha and beta decay. He
considered that the new particle was emitted from the nucleus together with
the electron or beta particle in the process of beta decay.⁸ [nb 2]

James Chadwick discovered a much more massive nuclear particle in 1932 and
also named it a neutron, leaving two kinds of particles with the same name.
Pauli earlier had used the term "neutron" for both the particle that
conserved energy in beta decay, and a presumed neutral particle in the
nucleus.[nb 3] The word "neutrino" entered the international vocabulary
through Enrico Fermi, who used it during a conference in Paris in July 1932
and at the Solvay Conference in October 1933, where also Pauli employed it.
The name (the Italian equivalent of "little neutral one") was jokingly
coined by Edoardo Amaldi during a conversation with Fermi at the Institute
of physics of via Panisperna in Rome, in order to distinguish this light
neutral particle from Chadwick's neutron. ⁹

In Fermi's theory of beta decay, Chadwick's large neutral particle could
decay to a proton, electron, and the smaller neutral particle (flavored as
an electron antineutrino):

  n0 → p+ + e− + ν
  e

Fermi's paper, written in 1934, unified Pauli's neutrino with Paul Dirac's
positron and Werner Heisenberg's neutron–proton model and gave a solid
theoretical basis for future experimental work. However, the journal Nature
rejected Fermi's paper, saying that the theory was "too remote from
reality". He submitted the paper to an Italian journal, which accepted it,
but the general lack of interest in his theory at that early date caused
him to switch to experimental physics.¹⁰ ¹¹

Nevertheless, even in 1934 there were hints that Bohr's idea that the
energy conservation laws were not followed, was incorrect. At the Solvay
conference of 1934, the first measurements of the energy spectra of beta
decay were reported, and these spectra were found to impose a strict limit
on the energy of electrons from each type of beta decay. Such a limit was
not expected if the conservation of energy was not upheld, in which case
any amount of energy would be expected to be statistically available in at
least a few decays. The natural explanation of the beta decay spectrum as
first measured in 1934 was that only a limited (and conserved) amount of
energy was available, and a new particle was sometimes taking a varying
fraction of this limited energy, leaving the rest for the beta particle.
Pauli made use of the occasion to publicly emphasize that the
still-undetected "neutrino" must be an actual particle.

Direct detection

In 1942 Wang Ganchang first proposed the use of beta capture to
experimentally detect neutrinos.¹² In the 20 July 1956 issue of Science,
Clyde Cowan, Frederick Reines, F. B. Harrison, H. W. Kruse, and A. D.
McGuire published confirmation that they had detected the neutrino,¹³ ¹⁴ a
result that was rewarded almost forty years later with the 1995 Nobel
Prize.¹⁵

In this experiment, now known as the Cowan–Reines neutrino experiment,
antineutrinos created in a nuclear reactor by beta decay reacted with
protons to produce neutrons and positrons:

  ν
  e + p+ → n0 + e+

The positron quickly finds an electron, and they annihilate each other. The
two resulting gamma rays (γ) are detectable. The neutron can be detected by
its capture on an appropriate nucleus, releasing a gamma ray. The
coincidence of both events – positron annihilation and neutron capture –
gives a unique signature of an antineutrino interaction.

Neutrino flavor

The antineutrino discovered by Cowan and Reines is the antiparticle of the
electron neutrino. In 1962, Leon M. Lederman, Melvin Schwartz and Jack
Steinberger showed that more than one type of neutrino exists by first
detecting interactions of the muon neutrino (already hypothesised with the
name neutretto),¹⁶ which earned them the 1988 Nobel Prize in Physics. When
the third type of lepton, the tau, was discovered in 1975 at the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center, it too was expected to have an associated
neutrino (the tau neutrino). First evidence for this third neutrino type
came from the observation of missing energy and momentum in tau decays
analogous to the beta decay leading to the discovery of the electron
neutrino. The first detection of tau neutrino interactions was announced in
summer of 2000 by the DONUT collaboration at Fermilab; its existence had
already been inferred by both theoretical consistency and experimental data
from the Large Electron–Positron Collider.

Solar neutrino problem

Main article: Solar neutrino problem

Starting in the late 1960s, several experiments found that the number of
electron neutrinos arriving from the Sun was between one third and one half
the number predicted by the Standard Solar Model. This discrepancy, which
became known as the solar neutrino problem, remained unresolved for some
thirty years. It was resolved by discovery of neutrino oscillation and
mass. (The Standard Model of particle physics had assumed that neutrinos
are massless and cannot change flavor. However, if neutrinos had mass, they
could change flavor, or oscillate between flavors).

Oscillation

A practical method for investigating neutrino oscillations was first
suggested by Bruno Pontecorvo in 1957 using an analogy with kaon
oscillations; over the subsequent 10 years he developed the mathematical
formalism and the modern formulation of vacuum oscillations. In 1985
Stanislav Mikheyev and Alexei Smirnov (expanding on 1978 work by Lincoln
Wolfenstein) noted that flavor oscillations can be modified when neutrinos
propagate through matter. This so-called Mikheyev–Smirnov–Wolfenstein
effect (MSW effect) is important to understand because many neutrinos
emitted by fusion in the Sun pass through the dense matter in the solar
core (where essentially all solar fusion takes place) on their way to
detectors on Earth.

Starting in 1998, experiments began to show that solar and atmospheric
neutrinos change flavors (see Super-Kamiokande and Sudbury Neutrino
Observatory). This resolved the solar neutrino problem: the electron
neutrinos produced in the Sun had partly changed into other flavors which
the experiments could not detect.

Although individual experiments, such as the set of solar neutrino
experiments, are consistent with non-oscillatory mechanisms of neutrino
flavor conversion, taken altogether, neutrino experiments imply the
existence of neutrino oscillations. Especially relevant in this context are
the reactor experiment KamLAND and the accelerator experiments such as
MINOS. The KamLAND experiment has indeed identified oscillations as the
neutrino flavor conversion mechanism involved in the solar electron
neutrinos. Similarly MINOS confirms the oscillation of atmospheric
neutrinos and gives a better determination of the mass squared splitting.¹⁷

Supernova neutrinos

See also: Supernova Early Warning System

Raymond Davis, Jr. and Masatoshi Koshiba were jointly awarded the 2002
Nobel Prize in Physics; Davis for his pioneer work on cosmic neutrinos and
Koshiba for the first real time observation of supernova neutrinos. The
detection of solar neutrinos, and of neutrinos of the SN 1987A supernova in
1987 marked the beginning of neutrino astronomy. In an average supernova,
approximately 10⁵⁷ (an Octodecillion) neutrinos are released.

Properties and reactions

The neutrino has half-integer spin (ħ⁄₂) and is therefore a fermion.
Neutrinos interact primarily through the weak force. The discovery of
neutrino flavor oscillations implies that neutrinos have mass. The
existence of a neutrino mass strongly suggests the existence of a tiny
neutrino magnetic moment¹⁸ of the order of 10−19 μB, allowing the
possibility that neutrinos may interact electromagnetically as well. An
experiment done by C. S. Wu at Columbia University showed that neutrinos
always have left-handed chirality.¹⁹ It is very hard to uniquely identify
neutrino interactions among the natural background of radioactivity. For
this reason, in early experiments a special reaction channel was chosen to
facilitate the identification: the interaction of an antineutrino with one
of the hydrogen nuclei in the water molecules. A hydrogen nucleus is a
single proton, so simultaneous nuclear interactions, which would occur
within a heavier nucleus, don't need to be considered for the detection
experiment. Within a cubic metre of water placed right outside a nuclear
reactor, only relatively few such interactions can be recorded, but the
setup is now used for measuring the reactor's plutonium production rate.

Mikheyev–Smirnov–Wolfenstein effect

Main article: Mikheyev–Smirnov–Wolfenstein effect

Neutrinos traveling through matter, in general, undergo a process analogous
to light traveling through a transparent material. This process is not
directly observable because it does not produce ionizing radiation, but
gives rise to the MSW effect. Only a small fraction of the neutrino's
energy is transferred to the material.

Nuclear reactions

Neutrinos can interact with a nucleus, changing it to another nucleus. This
process is used in radiochemical neutrino detectors. In this case, the
energy levels and spin states within the target nucleus have to be taken
into account to estimate the probability for an interaction. In general the
interaction probability increases with the number of neutrons and protons
within a nucleus.

Induced fission

Very much like neutrons do in nuclear reactors, neutrinos can induce
fission reactions within heavy nuclei.²⁰ So far, this reaction has not been
measured in a laboratory, but is predicted to happen within stars and
supernovae. The process affects the abundance of isotopes seen in the
universe.²¹ Neutrino fission of deuterium nuclei has been observed in the
Sudbury Neutrino Observatory, which uses a heavy water detector.

Types

There are three known types (flavors) of neutrinos: electron neutrino ν
e, muon neutrino ν
μ and tau neutrino ν
τ, named after their partner leptons in the Standard Model (see table at
right). The current best measurement of the number of neutrino types comes
from observing the decay of the Z boson. This particle can decay into any
light neutrino and its antineutrino, and the more types of light
neutrinos[nb 4] available, the shorter the lifetime of the Z boson.
Measurements of the Z lifetime have shown that the number of light neutrino
types is 3.¹⁸ The correspondence between the six quarks in the Standard
Model and the six leptons, among them the three neutrinos, suggests to
physicists' intuition that there should be exactly three types of neutrino.
However, actual proof that there are only three kinds of neutrinos remains
an elusive goal of particle physics.

The possibility of sterile neutrinos—relatively light neutrinos which do
not participate in the weak interaction but which could be created through
flavor oscillation (see below)—is unaffected by these Z-boson-based
measurements, and the existence of such particles is in fact hinted by
experimental data from the LSND experiment. However, the currently running
MiniBooNE experiment suggested, until recently, that sterile neutrinos are
not required to explain the experimental data,²² although the latest
research into this area is on-going and anomalies in the MiniBooNE data may
allow for exotic neutrino types, including sterile neutrinos.²³ A recent
re-analysis of reference electron spectra data from the Institut
Laue-Langevin²⁴ has also hinted at a fourth, sterile neutrino.²⁵

Recently analyzed data from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe of the
cosmic background radiation is compatible with either three or four types
of neutrinos. It is hoped that the addition of two more years of data from
the probe will resolve this uncertainty.²⁶

Antineutrinos

Antineutrinos, the antiparticles of neutrinos, are neutral particles
produced in nuclear beta decay. These are emitted during beta particle
emissions, in which a neutron decays into a proton, electron, and
antineutrino. They have a spin of ½, and are part of the lepton family of
particles. All antineutrinos observed thus far possess right-handed
helicity (i.e. only one of the two possible spin states has ever been
seen), while neutrinos are left-handed. Antineutrinos, like neutrinos,
interact with other matter only through the gravitational and weak forces,
making them very difficult to detect experimentally. Neutrino oscillation
experiments indicate that antineutrinos have mass, but beta decay
experiments constrain that mass to be very small. A neutrino–antineutrino
interaction has been suggested in attempts to form a composite photon with
the neutrino theory of light.

Because antineutrinos and neutrinos are neutral particles, it is possible
that they are actually the same particle. Particles that have this property
are known as Majorana particles. Majorana neutrinos have the property that
the neutrino and antineutrino could be distinguished only by chirality;
what experiments observe as a difference between the neutrino and
antineutrino could simply be due to one particle with two possible
chiralities. If neutrinos are indeed Majorana particles, neutrinoless
double beta decay, as well as a range of other lepton number violating
phenomena, would be allowed. Several experiments have been and are being
conducted to search for this process.

Researchers around the world have begun to investigate the possibility of
using antineutrinos for reactor monitoring in the context of preventing the
proliferation of nuclear weapons.²⁷ ²⁸ ²⁹

Antineutrinos were first detected as a result of their interaction with
protons in a large tank of water. This was installed next to a nuclear
reactor as a controllable source of the antineutrinos. (See: Cowan–Reines
neutrino experiment)

Only antineutrinos, not neutrinos, take part in the Glashow resonance.

Flavor oscillations

Main article: Neutrino oscillation

Neutrinos are most often created or detected with a well defined flavor
(electron, muon, tau). However, in a phenomenon known as neutrino flavor
oscillation, neutrinos are able to oscillate among the three available
flavors while they propagate through space. Specifically, this occurs
because the neutrino flavor eigenstates are not the same as the neutrino
mass eigenstates (simply called 1, 2, 3). This allows for a neutrino that
was produced as an electron neutrino at a given location to have a
calculable probability to be detected as either a muon or tau neutrino
after it has traveled to another location. This quantum mechanical effect
was first hinted by the discrepancy between the number of electron
neutrinos detected from the Sun's core failing to match the expected
numbers, dubbed as the "solar neutrino problem". In the Standard Model the
existence of flavor oscillations implies nonzero differences between the
neutrino masses, because the amount of mixing between neutrino flavors at a
given time depends on the differences between their squared masses. There
are other possibilities in which neutrino can oscillate even if they are
massless. If Lorentz invariance is not an exact symmetry, neutrinos can
experience Lorentz-violating oscillations.³⁰

It is possible that the neutrino and antineutrino are in fact the same
particle, a hypothesis first proposed by the Italian physicist Ettore
Majorana. The neutrino could transform into an antineutrino (and vice
versa) by flipping the orientation of its spin state.³¹

This change in spin would require the neutrino and antineutrino to have
nonzero mass, and therefore travel slower than light, because such a spin
flip, caused only by a change in point of view, can take place only if
inertial frames of reference exist that move faster than the particle: such
a particle has a spin of one orientation when seen from a frame which moves
slower than the particle, but the opposite spin when observed from a frame
that moves faster than the particle.

On July 19, 2013 the results from the T2K experiment presented at the
European Physical Society Conference on High Energy Physics in Stockholm,
Sweden, confirmed neutrino oscillation theory.³² ³³

Speed

Main article: Measurements of neutrino speed

Before neutrinos were found to oscillate, they were generally assumed to be
massless, propagating at the speed of light. According to the theory of
special relativity, the question of neutrino velocity is closely related to
their mass. If neutrinos are massless, they must travel at the speed of
light. However, if they have mass, they cannot reach the speed of light.

Also some Lorentz-violating variants of quantum gravity might allow
faster-than-light neutrinos. A comprehensive framework for Lorentz
violations is the Standard-Model Extension (SME).

In the early 1980s, first measurements of neutrino speed were done using
pulsed pion beams (produced by pulsed proton beams hitting a target). The
pions decayed producing neutrinos, and the neutrino interactions observed
within a time window in a detector at a distance were consistent with the
speed of light. This measurement was repeated in 2007 using the MINOS
detectors, which found the speed of 3 GeV neutrinos to be, at the 99%
confidence level, in the range between 0.999976 c and 1.000126 c. The
central value of 1.000051c is higher than the speed of light but is also
consistent with a velocity of exactly c or even slightly less. This
measurement set an upper bound on the mass of the muon neutrino of 50 MeV
at 99% confidence.³⁴ ³⁵ After the detectors for the project were upgraded
in 2012, MINOS refined their initial result and found agreement with the
speed of light, with the difference in the arrival time of neutrinos and
light of -0.0006% (±0.0012%).³⁶

A similar observation was made, on a much larger scale, with supernova
1987A (SN 1987A). 10-MeV antineutrinos from the supernova were detected
within a time window that was consistent with the speed of light for the
neutrinos. Currently, the question of whether or not neutrinos have mass
cannot be decided; their speed is (as yet) indistinguishable from the speed
of light.

In September 2011, the OPERA collaboration released calculations showing
velocities of 17-GeV and 28-GeV neutrinos exceeding the speed of light in
their experiments (see Faster-than-light neutrino anomaly). In November
2011, OPERA repeated its experiment with changes so that the speed could be
determined individually for each detected neutrino. The results showed the
same faster-than-light speed. However, in February 2012 reports came out
that the results may have been caused by a loose fiber optic cable attached
to one of the atomic clocks which measured the departure and arrival times
of the neutrinos. An independent recreation of the experiment in the same
laboratory by ICARUS found no discernible difference between the speed of a
neutrino and the speed of light.³⁷ In June 2012, CERN announced that new
measurements conducted by four Gran Sasso experiments (OPERA, ICARUS,
Borexino and LVD) found agreement between the speed of light and the speed
of neutrinos, finally refuting the initial OPERA result.³⁸

Mass

The Standard Model of particle physics assumed that neutrinos are massless.
However the experimentally established phenomenon of neutrino oscillation,
which mixes neutrino flavour states with neutrino mass states (analogously
to CKM mixing), requires neutrinos to have nonzero masses.²² Massive
neutrinos were originally conceived by Bruno Pontecorvo in the 1950s.
Enhancing the basic framework to accommodate their mass is straightforward
by adding a right-handed Lagrangian. This can be done in two ways. If, like
other fundamental Standard Model particles, mass is generated by the Dirac
mechanism, then the framework would require an SU(2) singlet. This particle
would have no other Standard Model interactions (apart from the Yukawa
interactions with the neutral component of the Higgs doublet), so is called
a sterile neutrino. Or, mass can be generated by the Majorana mechanism,
which would require the neutrino and antineutrino to be the same particle.

The strongest upper limit on the masses of neutrinos comes from cosmology:
the Big Bang model predicts that there is a fixed ratio between the number
of neutrinos and the number of photons in the cosmic microwave background.
If the total energy of all three types of neutrinos exceeded an average of
50 eV per neutrino, there would be so much mass in the universe that it
would collapse.³⁹ This limit can be circumvented by assuming that the
neutrino is unstable; however, there are limits within the Standard Model
that make this difficult. A much more stringent constraint comes from a
careful analysis of cosmological data, such as the cosmic microwave
background radiation, galaxy surveys, and the Lyman-alpha forest. These
indicate that the summed masses of the three neutrinos must be less than
0.3 eV.⁴⁰

In 1998, research results at the Super-Kamiokande neutrino detector
determined that neutrinos can oscillate from one flavor to another, which
requires that they must have a nonzero mass.⁴¹ While this shows that
neutrinos have mass, the absolute neutrino mass scale is still not known.
This is because neutrino oscillations are sensitive only to the difference
in the squares of the masses.⁴² The best estimate of the difference in the
squares of the masses of mass eigenstates 1 and 2 was published by KamLAND
in 2005: Δm2
21 = 0.000079 eV².⁴³ In 2006, the MINOS experiment measured oscillations
from an intense muon neutrino beam, determining the difference in the
squares of the masses between neutrino mass eigenstates 2 and 3. The
initial results indicate |Δm2
32| = 0.0027 eV², consistent with previous results from Super-Kamiokande.⁴⁴
Since |Δm2
32| is the difference of two squared masses, at least one of them has to
have a value which is at least the square root of this value. Thus, there
exists at least one neutrino mass eigenstate with a mass of at least 0.04
eV.⁴⁵

In 2009, lensing data of a galaxy cluster were analyzed to predict a
neutrino mass of about 1.5 eV.⁴⁶ This surprisingly high value requires that
the three neutrino masses be nearly equal, with neutrino oscillations of
order meV. The masses lie below the Mainz-Troitsk upper bound of 2.2 eV for
the electron antineutrino.⁴⁷ The latter will be tested in 2015 in the
KATRIN experiment, that searches for a mass between 0.2 eV and 2 eV.

A number of efforts are under way to directly determine the absolute
neutrino mass scale in laboratory experiments. The methods applied involve
nuclear beta decay (KATRIN and MARE).

On 31 May 2010, OPERA researchers observed the first tau neutrino candidate
event in a muon neutrino beam, the first time this transformation in
neutrinos had been observed, providing further evidence that they have
mass.⁴⁸

In July 2010 the 3-D MegaZ DR7 galaxy survey reported that they had
measured a limit of the combined mass of the three neutrino varieties to be
less than 0.28 eV.⁴⁹ A tighter upper bound yet for this sum of masses, 0.23
eV, was reported in March 2013 by the Planck collaboration,⁵⁰ whereas a
February 2014 result estimates the sum as 0.320 ± 0.081 eV based on
discrepancies between the cosmological consequences implied by Planck's
detailed measurements of the Cosmic Microwave Background and predictions
arising from observing other phenomena, combined with the assumption that
neutrinos are responsible for the observed weaker gravitational lensing
than would be expected from massless neutrinos.⁵¹

If the neutrino is a Majorana particle, the mass may be calculated by
finding the half life of neutrinoless double-beta decay of certain nuclei.
As of 2015, the lowest upper limit on the Majorana mass of the neutrino has
been set by KamLAND-Zen: 0.12–0.25 eV.⁵²

Size

Standard Model neutrinos are fundamental point-like particles. An effective
size can be defined using their electroweak cross section (apparent size in
electroweak interaction). The average electroweak characteristic size is r²
= n × 10−33 cm² (n × 1 nanobarn), where n = 3.2 for electron neutrino, n =
1.7 for muon neutrino and n = 1.0 for tau neutrino; it depends on no other
properties than mass.⁵³ However, this is best understood as being relevant
only to probability of scattering. Since the neutrino does not interact
electromagnetically, and is defined quantum mechanically by a wavefunction,
it does not have a size in the same sense as everyday objects.⁵⁴
Furthermore, processes that produce neutrinos impart such high energies to
them that they travel at almost the speed of light. Nevertheless, neutrinos
are fermions, and thus obey the Pauli exclusion principle, i.e. that
increasing their density forces them into progressively higher momentum
states.

Chirality

Experimental results show that (nearly) all produced and observed neutrinos
have left-handed helicities (spins antiparallel to momenta), and all
antineutrinos have right-handed helicities, within the margin of error. In
the massless limit, it means that only one of two possible chiralities is
observed for either particle. These are the only chiralities included in
the Standard Model of particle interactions.

It is possible that their counterparts (right-handed neutrinos and
left-handed antineutrinos) simply do not exist. If they do, their
properties are substantially different from observable neutrinos and
antineutrinos. It is theorized that they are either very heavy (on the
order of GUT scale—see Seesaw mechanism), do not participate in weak
interaction (so-called sterile neutrinos), or both.

The existence of nonzero neutrino masses somewhat complicates the
situation. Neutrinos are produced in weak interactions as chirality
eigenstates. However, chirality of a massive particle is not a constant of
motion; helicity is, but the chirality operator does not share eigenstates
with the helicity operator. Free neutrinos propagate as mixtures of left-
and right-handed helicity states, with mixing amplitudes on the order of
mν/E. This does not significantly affect the experiments, because neutrinos
involved are nearly always ultrarelativistic, and thus mixing amplitudes
are vanishingly small. For example, most solar neutrinos have energies on
the order of 100 keV–1 MeV, so the fraction of neutrinos with "wrong"
helicity among them cannot exceed 10−10.⁵⁵ ⁵⁶

Sources

Artificial

Reactor neutrinos

Nuclear reactors are the major source of human-generated neutrinos.
Antineutrinos are made in the beta-decay of neutron-rich daughter fragments
in the fission process. Generally, the four main isotopes contributing to
the antineutrino flux are 235U, 238U, 239Pu and 241Pu (i.e. via the
antineutrinos emitted during beta-minus decay of their respective fission
fragments). The average nuclear fission releases about 200 MeV of energy,
of which roughly 4.5% (or about 9 MeV)⁵⁷ is radiated away as antineutrinos.
For a typical nuclear reactor with a thermal power of 4000 MW, meaning that
the core produces this much heat, and an electrical power generation of
1300 MW, the total power production from fissioning atoms is actually 4185
MW, of which 185 MW is radiated away as antineutrino radiation and never
appears in the engineering. This is to say, 185 MW of fission energy is
lost from this reactor and does not appear as heat available to run
turbines, since antineutrinos penetrate all building materials practically
without interaction.[nb 5]

The antineutrino energy spectrum depends on the degree to which the fuel is
burned (plutonium-239 fission antineutrinos on average have slightly more
energy than those from uranium-235 fission), but in general, the detectable
antineutrinos from fission have a peak energy between about 3.5 and 4 MeV,
with a maximum energy of about 10 MeV.⁵⁸ There is no established
experimental method to measure the flux of low-energy antineutrinos. Only
antineutrinos with an energy above threshold of 1.8 MeV can be uniquely
identified (see neutrino detection below). An estimated 3% of all
antineutrinos from a nuclear reactor carry an energy above this threshold.
Thus, an average nuclear power plant may generate over 10²⁰ antineutrinos
per second above this threshold, but also a much larger number (97%/3% =
~30 times this number) below the energy threshold, which cannot be seen
with present detector technology.

Accelerator neutrinos

Some particle accelerators have been used to make neutrino beams. The
technique is to collide protons with a fixed target, producing charged
pions or kaons. These unstable particles are then magnetically focused into
a long tunnel where they decay while in flight. Because of the relativistic
boost of the decaying particle, the neutrinos are produced as a beam rather
than isotropically. Efforts to construct an accelerator facility where
neutrinos are produced through muon decays are ongoing.⁵⁹ Such a setup is
generally known as a neutrino factory.

Nuclear bombs

Nuclear bombs also produce very large quantities of neutrinos. Fred Reines
and Clyde Cowan considered the detection of neutrinos from a bomb prior to
their search for reactor neutrinos; a fission reactor was recommended as a
better alternative by Los Alamos physics division leader J.M.B. Kellogg.⁶⁰
Fission bombs produce antineutrinos (from the fission process), and fusion
bombs produce both neutrinos (from the fusion process) and antineutrinos
(from the initiating fission explosion).

Geologic

Main article: Geoneutrino

Neutrinos are part of the natural background radiation. In particular, the
decay chains of 238U and 232Th isotopes, as well as40K, include beta decays
which emit antineutrinos. These so-called geoneutrinos can provide valuable
information on the Earth's interior. A first indication for geoneutrinos
was found by the KamLAND experiment in 2005. KamLAND's main background in
the geoneutrino measurement are the antineutrinos coming from reactors.
Several future experiments aim at improving the geoneutrino measurement and
these will necessarily have to be far away from reactors.

Atmospheric

Atmospheric neutrinos result from the interaction of cosmic rays with
atomic nuclei in the Earth's atmosphere, creating showers of particles,
many of which are unstable and produce neutrinos when they decay. A
collaboration of particle physicists from Tata Institute of Fundamental
Research (India), Osaka City University (Japan) and Durham University (UK)
recorded the first cosmic ray neutrino interaction in an underground
laboratory in Kolar Gold Fields in India in 1965.

Solar

Solar neutrinos originate from the nuclear fusion powering the Sun and
other stars. The details of the operation of the Sun are explained by the
Standard Solar Model. In short: when four protons fuse to become one helium
nucleus, two of them have to convert into neutrons, and each such
conversion releases one electron neutrino.

The Sun sends enormous numbers of neutrinos in all directions. Each second,
about 65 billion (6.5×10¹⁰) solar neutrinos pass through every square
centimeter on the part of the Earth that faces the Sun.⁶ Since neutrinos
are insignificantly absorbed by the mass of the Earth, the surface area on
the side of the Earth opposite the Sun receives about the same number of
neutrinos as the side facing the Sun.

Supernovae

In 1966 Colgate and White⁶¹ calculated that neutrinos carry away most of
the gravitational energy released by the collapse of massive stars, events
now categorized as Type Ib and Ic and Type II supernovae. When such stars
collapse, matter densities at the core becomes so high (10¹⁷ kg/m³) that
the degeneracy of electrons is not enough to prevent protons and electrons
from combining to form a neutron and an electron neutrino. A second and
more important neutrino source is the thermal energy (100 billion kelvins)
of the newly formed neutron core, which is dissipated via the formation of
neutrino–antineutrino pairs of all flavors.⁶²

Colgate and White's theory of supernova neutrino production was confirmed
in 1987, when neutrinos from supernova 1987A were detected. The water-based
detectors Kamiokande II and IMB detected 11 and 8 antineutrinos of thermal
origin,⁶² respectively, while the scintillator-based Baksan detector found
5 neutrinos (lepton number = 1) of either thermal or electron-capture
origin, in a burst lasting less than 13 seconds. The neutrino signal from
the supernova arrived at earth several hours before the arrival of the
first electromagnetic radiation, as expected from the evident fact that the
latter emerges along with the shock wave. The exceptionally feeble
interaction with normal matter allowed the neutrinos to pass through the
churning mass of the exploding star, while the electromagnetic photons were
slowed.

Because neutrinos interact so little with matter, it is thought that a
supernova's neutrino emissions carry information about the innermost
regions of the explosion. Much of the visible light comes from the decay of
radioactive elements produced by the supernova shock wave, and even light
from the explosion itself is scattered by dense and turbulent gases, and
thus delayed. The neutrino burst is expected to reach Earth before any
electromagnetic waves, including visible light, gamma rays or radio waves.
The exact time delay depends on the velocity of the shock wave and on the
thickness of the outer layer of the star. For a Type II supernova,
astronomers expect the neutrino flood to be released seconds after the
stellar core collapse, while the first electromagnetic signal may emerge
hours later, after the explosion shock wave has had time to reach the
surface of the star. The SNEWS project uses a network of neutrino detectors
to monitor the sky for candidate supernova events; the neutrino signal will
provide a useful advance warning of a star exploding in the Milky Way.

Although neutrinos pass through the outer gases of a supernova without
scattering, they provide information about the deeper supernova core with
evidence that here, even neutrinos scatter to a significant extent. In a
supernova core the densities are those of a neutron star (which is expected
to be formed in this type of supernova),⁶³ becoming large enough to
influence the duration of the neutrino signal by delaying some neutrinos.
The length of the neutrino signal from SN 1987A, some 13 seconds, was far
longer than it would take in theory for neutrinos to pass directly through
the neutrino-generating core of a supernova, expected to be only 32
kilometers in diameter SN 1987A. The number of neutrinos counted was also
consistent with a total neutrino energy of 2.2 x 10⁴⁶ joules, which was
estimated to be nearly all of the total energy of the supernova.⁶⁴

Supernova remnants

The energy of supernova neutrinos ranges from a few to several tens of MeV.
However, the sites where cosmic rays are accelerated are expected to
produce neutrinos that are at least one million times more energetic,
produced from turbulent gaseous environments left over by supernova
explosions: the supernova remnants. The origin of the cosmic rays was
attributed to supernovas by Walter Baade and Fritz Zwicky; this hypothesis
was refined by Vitaly L. Ginzburg and Sergei I. Syrovatsky who attributed
the origin to supernova remnants, and supported their claim by the crucial
remark, that the cosmic ray losses of the Milky Way is compensated, if the
efficiency of acceleration in supernova remnants is about 10 percent.
Ginzburg and Syrovatskii's hypothesis is supported by the specific
mechanism of "shock wave acceleration" happening in supernova remnants,
which is consistent with the original theoretical picture drawn by Enrico
Fermi, and is receiving support from observational data. The
very-high-energy neutrinos are still to be seen, but this branch of
neutrino astronomy is just in its infancy. The main existing or forthcoming
experiments that aim at observing very-high-energy neutrinos from our
galaxy are Baikal, AMANDA, IceCube, ANTARES, NEMO and Nestor. Related
information is provided by very-high-energy gamma ray observatories, such
as VERITAS, HESS and MAGIC. Indeed, the collisions of cosmic rays are
supposed to produce charged pions, whose decay give the neutrinos, and also
neutral pions, whose decay give gamma rays: the environment of a supernova
remnant is transparent to both types of radiation.

Still-higher-energy neutrinos, resulting from the interactions of
extragalactic cosmic rays, could be observed with the Pierre Auger
Observatory or with the dedicated experiment named ANITA.

Big Bang

Main article: Cosmic neutrino background

It is thought that, just like the cosmic microwave background radiation
left over from the Big Bang, there is a background of low-energy neutrinos
in our Universe. In the 1980s it was proposed that these may be the
explanation for the dark matter thought to exist in the universe. Neutrinos
have one important advantage over most other dark matter candidates: it is
known that they exist. However, this idea also has serious problems.

From particle experiments, it is known that neutrinos are very light. This
means that they easily move at speeds close to the speed of light. For this
reason, dark matter made from neutrinos is termed "hot dark matter". The
problem is that being fast moving, the neutrinos would tend to have spread
out evenly in the universe before cosmological expansion made them cold
enough to congregate in clumps. This would cause the part of dark matter
made of neutrinos to be smeared out and unable to cause the large galactic
structures that we see.

Further, these same galaxies and groups of galaxies appear to be surrounded
by dark matter that is not fast enough to escape from those galaxies.
Presumably this matter provided the gravitational nucleus for formation.
This implies that neutrinos cannot make up a significant part of the total
amount of dark matter.

From cosmological arguments, relic background neutrinos are estimated to
have density of 56 of each type per cubic centimeter and temperature 1.9 K
(1.7×10−4 eV) if they are massless, much colder if their mass exceeds 0.001
eV. Although their density is quite high, they have not yet been observed
in the laboratory, as their energy is below thresholds of most detection
methods, and due to extremely low neutrino interaction cross-sections at
sub-eV energies. In contrast, boron-8 solar neutrinos—which are emitted
with a higher energy—have been detected definitively despite having a space
density that is lower than that of relic neutrinos by some 6 orders of
magnitude.

Detection

Main article: Neutrino detector

Neutrinos cannot be detected directly, because they do not ionize the
materials they are passing through (they do not carry electric charge and
other proposed effects, like the MSW effect, do not produce traceable
radiation). A unique reaction to identify antineutrinos, sometimes referred
to as inverse beta decay, as applied by Reines and Cowan (see below),
requires a very large detector in order to detect a significant number of
neutrinos. All detection methods require the neutrinos to carry a minimum
threshold energy. So far, there is no detection method for low-energy
neutrinos, in the sense that potential neutrino interactions (for example
by the MSW effect) cannot be uniquely distinguished from other causes.
Neutrino detectors are often built underground in order to isolate the
detector from cosmic rays and other background radiation.

Antineutrinos were first detected in the 1950s near a nuclear reactor.
Reines and Cowan used two targets containing a solution of cadmium chloride
in water. Two scintillation detectors were placed next to the cadmium
targets. Antineutrinos with an energy above the threshold of 1.8 MeV caused
charged current interactions with the protons in the water, producing
positrons and neutrons. This is very much like β+ decay, where energy is
used to convert a proton into a neutron, a positron (e+) and an electron
neutrino (ν
e) is emitted:

From known β+ decay:

  Energy + p → n + e+ + ν
  e

In the Cowan and Reines experiment, instead of an outgoing neutrino, you
have an incoming antineutrino (ν
e) from a nuclear reactor:

  Energy (>1.8 MeV) + p + ν
  e → n + e+

The resulting positron annihilation with electrons in the detector material
created photons with an energy of about 0.5 MeV. Pairs of photons in
coincidence could be detected by the two scintillation detectors above and
below the target. The neutrons were captured by cadmium nuclei resulting in
gamma rays of about 8 MeV that were detected a few microseconds after the
photons from a positron annihilation event.

Since then, various detection methods have been used. Super Kamiokande is a
large volume of water surrounded by photomultiplier tubes that watch for
the Cherenkov radiation emitted when an incoming neutrino creates an
electron or muon in the water. The Sudbury Neutrino Observatory is similar,
but uses heavy water as the detecting medium, which uses the same effects,
but also allows the additional reaction any-flavor neutrino
photo-dissociation of deuterium, resulting in a free neutron which is then
detected from gamma radiation after chlorine-capture. Other detectors have
consisted of large volumes of chlorine or gallium which are periodically
checked for excesses of argon or germanium, respectively, which are created
by electron-neutrinos interacting with the original substance. MINOS uses a
solid plastic scintillator coupled to photomultiplier tubes, while Borexino
uses a liquid pseudocumene scintillator also watched by photomultiplier
tubes and the proposed NOνA detector will use liquid scintillator watched
by avalanche photodiodes. The IceCube Neutrino Observatory uses 1 km³ of
the Antarctic ice sheet near the south pole with photomultiplier tubes
distributed throughout the volume.

Motivation for scientific interest

Neutrinos' low mass and neutral charge mean they interact exceedingly
weakly with other particles and fields. This feature of weak interaction
interests scientists because it means neutrinos can be used to probe
environments that other radiation (such as light or radio waves) cannot
penetrate.

Using neutrinos as a probe was first proposed in the mid-20th century as a
way to detect conditions at the core of the Sun. The solar core cannot be
imaged directly because electromagnetic radiation (such as light) is
diffused by the great amount and density of matter surrounding the core. On
the other hand, neutrinos pass through the Sun with few interactions.
Whereas photons emitted from the solar core may require 40,000 years to
diffuse to the outer layers of the Sun, neutrinos generated in stellar
fusion reactions at the core cross this distance practically unimpeded at
nearly the speed of light.⁶⁵ ⁶⁶

Neutrinos are also useful for probing astrophysical sources beyond the
Solar System because they are the only known particles that are not
significantly attenuated by their travel through the interstellar medium.
Optical photons can be obscured or diffused by dust, gas, and background
radiation. High-energy cosmic rays, in the form of swift protons and atomic
nuclei, are unable to travel more than about 100 megaparsecs due to the
Greisen–Zatsepin–Kuzmin limit (GZK cutoff). Neutrinos, in contrast, can
travel even greater distances barely attenuated.

The galactic core of the Milky Way is fully obscured by dense gas and
numerous bright objects. Neutrinos produced in the galactic core might be
measurable by Earth-based neutrino telescopes.

Another important use of the neutrino is in the observation of supernovae,
the explosions that end the lives of highly massive stars. The core
collapse phase of a supernova is an extremely dense and energetic event. It
is so dense that no known particles are able to escape the advancing core
front except for neutrinos. Consequently, supernovae are known to release
approximately 99% of their radiant energy in a short (10-second) burst of
neutrinos.⁶⁷ These neutrinos are a very useful probe for core collapse
studies.

The rest mass of the neutrino (see above) is an important test of
cosmological and astrophysical theories (see Dark matter). The neutrino's
significance in probing cosmological phenomena is as great as any other
method, and is thus a major focus of study in astrophysical communities.⁶⁸

The study of neutrinos is important in particle physics because neutrinos
typically have the lowest mass, and hence are examples of the lowest-energy
particles theorized in extensions of the Standard Model of particle
physics.

In November 2012 American scientists used a particle accelerator to send a
coherent neutrino message through 780 feet of rock. This marks the first
use of neutrinos for communication, and future research may permit binary
neutrino messages to be sent immense distances through even the densest
materials, such as the Earth's core.⁶⁹

Notes

[1] More specifically, the electron neutrino.
[2] Niels Bohr was notably opposed to this interpretation of beta decay and
  was ready to accept that energy, momentum and angular momentum were not
  conserved quantities.
[3] These events necessitated renaming Pauli's less massive,
  momentum-conserving particle.
[4] In this context, "light neutrino" means neutrinos with less than half
  the mass of the Z boson.
[5] Typically about one third of the heat which is deposited in a reactor
  core is available to be converted to electricity, and a 4000 MW reactor
  would produce only 2700 MW of actual heat, with the rest being converted
  to its 1300 MW of electric power production.

Neutron

This article is about the subatomic particle. For other uses, see Neutron
(disambiguation).

The neutron is a subatomic particle, symbol n or n0, with no net electric
charge and a mass slightly larger than that of a proton. Protons and
neutrons, each with mass approximately one atomic mass unit, constitute the
nucleus of an atom, and they are collectively referred to as nucleons.⁴
Their properties and interactions are described by nuclear physics.

The nucleus consists of Z protons, where Z is called the atomic number, and
N neutrons, where N is the neutron number. The atomic number defines the
chemical properties of the atom, and the neutron number determines the
isotope or nuclide.⁵ The terms isotope and nuclide are often used
synonymously, but they refer to chemical and nuclear properties,
respectively. The atomic mass number, symbol A, equals Z+N. For example,
carbon has atomic number 6, and its abundant carbon-12 isotope has 6
neutrons, whereas its rare carbon-13 isotope has 7 neutrons. Some elements
occur in nature with only one stable isotope, such as fluorine (see stable
nuclide). Other elements occur as many stable isotopes, such as tin with
ten stable isotopes. Even though it is not a chemical element, the neutron
is included in the table of nuclides.⁶

Within the nucleus, protons and neutrons are bound together through the
nuclear force, and neutrons are required for the stability of nuclei.
Neutrons are produced copiously in nuclear fission and fusion. They are a
primary contributor to the nucleosynthesis of chemical elements within
stars through fission, fusion, and neutron capture processes.

The neutron is essential to the production of nuclear power. In the decade
after the neutron was discovered in 1932,⁷ neutrons were used to effect
many different types of nuclear transmutations. With the discovery of
nuclear fission in 1938,⁸ it was quickly realized that, if a fission event
produced neutrons, each of these neutrons might cause further fission
events, etc., in a cascade known as a nuclear chain reaction.⁵ These events
and findings led to the first self-sustaining nuclear reactor (Chicago
Pile-1, 1942) and the first nuclear weapon (Trinity, 1945).

Free neutrons, or individual neutrons free of the nucleus, are effectively
a form of ionizing radiation, and as such, are a biological hazard,
depending upon dose.⁵ A small natural "neutron background" flux of free
neutrons exists on Earth, caused by cosmic ray muons, and by the natural
radioactivity of spontaneously fissionable elements in the Earth's crust.⁹
Dedicated neutron sources like neutron generators, research reactors and
spallation sources produce free neutrons for use in irradiation and in
neutron scattering experiments.

Description

Neutrons and protons are both nucleons, which are attracted and bound
together by the nuclear force to form atomic nuclei. The nucleus of the
most common isotope of the hydrogen atom (with the chemical symbol "H") is
a lone proton. The nuclei of the heavy hydrogen isotopes deuterium and
tritium contain one proton bound to one and two neutrons, respectively. All
other types of atomic nuclei are composed of two or more protons and
various numbers of neutrons. The most common nuclide of the common chemical
element lead, ²⁰⁸Pb has 82 protons and 126 neutrons, for example.

The free neutron has a mass of about 1.675×10−27 kg (equivalent to 939.6
MeV/c², or 1.0087 u).³ The neutron has a mean square radius of about
0.8×10−15 m, or 0.8 fm,¹⁰ and it is a spin-½ fermion.¹¹ The neutron has a
magnetic moment with a negative value, because its orientation is opposite
to the neutron's spin.¹² The neutron's magnetic moment causes its motion to
be influenced by magnetic fields. Although the neutron has no net electric
charge, it does have a slight distribution of charge within it. With its
positive electric charge, the proton is directly influenced by electric
fields, whereas the response of the neutron to this force is much weaker.

A free neutron is unstable, decaying to a proton, electron and antineutrino
with a mean lifetime of just under 15 minutes (881.5±1.5 s). This
radioactive decay, known as beta decay,¹³ is possible since the mass of the
neutron is slightly greater than the proton. The free proton is stable.
Neutrons or protons bound in a nucleus can be stable or unstable, however,
depending on the nuclide. Beta decay, in which neutrons decay to protons,
or vice versa, is governed by the weak force, and it requires the emission
or absorption of electrons and neutrinos, or their antiparticles.

Protons and neutrons behave almost identically under the influence of the
nuclear force within the nucleus. The concept of isospin, in which the
proton and neutron are viewed as two quantum states of the same particle,
is used to model the interactions of nucleons by the nuclear or weak
forces. Because of the strength of the nuclear force at short distances,
the binding energy of nucleons is more than seven orders of magnitude
larger than the electromagnetic energy binding electrons in atoms. Nuclear
reactions (such as nuclear fission) therefore have an energy density that
is more than ten million times that of chemical reactions. Because of the
mass–energy equivalence, nuclear binding energies add or subtract from the
mass of nuclei. Ultimately, the ability of the nuclear force to store
energy arising from the electromagnetic repulsion of nuclear components is
the basis for most of the energy that makes nuclear reactors or bombs
possible. In nuclear fission, the absorption of a neutron by a heavy
nuclide (e.g., uranium-235) causes the nuclide to become unstable and break
into light nuclides and additional neutrons. The positively charged light
nuclides then repel, releasing electromagnetic potential energy.

The neutron is classified as a hadron, since it is composed of quarks, and
as a baryon, since it is composed of three quarks.¹⁴ The finite size of the
neutron and its magnetic moment indicate the neutron is a composite, rather
than elementary, particle. The neutron consists of two down quarks with
charge −⅓  e and one up quark with charge +⅔ e, although this simple model
belies the complexities of the Standard Model for nuclei.¹⁵ The masses of
the three quarks sum to only about 12 MeV/c², whereas the neutron's mass is
about 940 MeV/c², for example.¹⁵ Like the proton, the quarks of the neutron
are held together by the strong force, mediated by gluons.¹⁶ The nuclear
force results from secondary effects of the more fundamental strong force.

Discovery

Main article: Discovery of the neutron

The story of the discovery of the neutron and its properties is central to
the extraordinary developments in atomic physics that occurred in the first
half of the 20th century, leading ultimately to the atomic bomb in 1945. In
the 1911 Rutherford model, the atom consisted of a small positively charged
massive nucleus surrounded by a much larger cloud of negatively charged
electrons. In 1920 Rutherford suggested the nucleus consisted of positive
protons and neutrally-charged particles, suggested to be a proton and an
electron bound in some way.¹⁷ Electrons were assumed to reside within the
nucleus because it was known that beta radiation consisted of electrons
emitted from the nucleus.¹⁷ Rutherford called these uncharged particles
neutrons, by the Latin root for neutralis (neuter) and the Greek suffix -on
(a suffix used in the names of subatomic particles, i.e. electron and
proton).¹⁸ ¹⁹ References to the word neutron in connection with the atom
can be found in the literature as early as 1899, however.²⁰

Throughout the 1920s, physicists assumed that the atomic nucleus was
composed of protons and "nuclear electrons"²¹ ²² but there were obvious
problems. It was difficult to reconcile the proton–electron model for
nuclei with the Heisenberg uncertainty relation of quantum mechanics.²³ ²⁴
The Klein paradox,²⁵ discovered by Oskar Klein in 1928, presented further
quantum mechanical objections to the notion of an electron confined within
a nucleus.²³ Observed properties of atoms and molecules were inconsistent
with the nuclear spin expected from proton–electron hypothesis. Since both
protons and electrons carry an intrinsic spin of ½ ħ, there is no way to
arrange an odd number of spins ±½ ħ to give a spin integer multiple of ħ.
Nuclei with integer spin are common, e.g., ¹⁴N.

In 1931, Walther Bothe and Herbert Becker found that if alpha particle
radiation from polonium fell on beryllium, boron, or lithium, an unusually
penetrating radiation was produced. The radiation was not influenced by an
electric field, so Bothe and Becker assumed it was gamma radiation.²⁶ ²⁷
The following year Irène Joliot-Curie and Frédéric Joliot in Paris showed
that if this "gamma" radiation fell on paraffin, or any other
hydrogen-containing compound, it ejected protons of very high energy.²⁸
Neither Rutherford nor James Chadwick at the Cavendish Laboratory in
Cambridge were convinced by the gamma ray interpretation.²¹ Chadwick
quickly performed a series of experiments that showed that the new
radiation consisted of uncharged particles with about the same mass as the
proton.⁷ ²⁹ ³⁰ These particles were neutrons. Chadwick won the Nobel Prize
in Physics for this discovery in 1935.²

Models for atomic nucleus consisting of protons and neutrons were quickly
developed by Werner Heisenberg³¹ ³² ³³ and others.³⁴ ³⁵ The proton–neutron
model explained the puzzle of nuclear spins. The origins of beta radiation
were explained by Enrico Fermi in 1934 by the process of beta decay, in
which the neutron decays to a proton by creating an electron and a (as yet
undiscovered) neutrino.³⁶ In 1935 Chadwick and his doctoral student Maurice
Goldhaber, reported the first accurate measurement of the mass of the
neutron.³⁷ ³⁸

By 1934, Fermi had bombarded heavier elements with neutrons to induce
radioactivity in elements of high atomic number. In 1938, Fermi received
the Nobel Prize in Physics "for his demonstrations of the existence of new
radioactive elements produced by neutron irradiation, and for his related
discovery of nuclear reactions brought about by slow neutrons".³⁹ In 1938
Otto Hahn, Lise Meitner, and Fritz Strassmann discovered nuclear fission,
or the fractionation of uranium nuclei into light elements, induced by
neutron bombardment.⁴⁰ ⁴¹ ⁴² In 1945 Hahn received the 1944 Nobel Prize in
Chemistry "for his discovery of the fission of heavy atomic nuclei." ⁴³ ⁴⁴
⁴⁵ The discovery of nuclear fission would lead to the development of
nuclear power and the atomic bomb by the end of World War II.

Beta decay and the stability of the nucleus

Under the Standard Model of particle physics, the only possible decay mode
for the neutron that conserves baryon number is for one of the neutron's
quarks to change flavour via the weak interaction. The decay of one of the
neutron's down quarks into a lighter up quark can be achieved by the
emission of a W boson. By this process, the Standard Model description of
beta decay, the neutron decays into a proton (which contains one down and
two up quarks), an electron, and an electron antineutrino.

Since interacting protons have a mutual electromagnetic repulsion that is
stronger than their attractive nuclear interaction, neutrons are a
necessary constituent of any atomic nucleus that contains more than one
proton (see diproton and neutron–proton ratio).⁴⁶ Neutrons bind with
protons and one another in the nucleus via the nuclear force, effectively
moderating the repulsive forces between the protons and stabilizing the
nucleus.

Free neutron decay

Outside the nucleus, free neutrons are unstable and have a mean lifetime of
881.5±1.5 s (about 14 minutes, 42 seconds); therefore the half-life for
this process (which differs from the mean lifetime by a factor of ln(2) =
0.693) is 611.0±1.0 s (about 10 minutes, 11 seconds).¹³ Beta decay of the
neutron, described above, can be denoted by the radioactive decay:⁴⁷

  n0 → p+ + e− + ν
  e

where p+, e−, and ν
e denote the proton, electron and electron antineutrino, respectively. For
the free neutron the decay energy for this process (based on the masses of
the neutron, proton, and electron) is 0.782343 MeV. The maximal energy of
the beta decay electron (in the process wherein the neutrino receives a
vanishingly small amount of kinetic energy) has been measured at 0.782 ±
.013 MeV.⁴⁸ The latter number is not well-enough measured to determine the
comparatively tiny rest mass of the neutrino (which must in theory be
subtracted from the maximal electron kinetic energy) as well as neutrino
mass is constrained by many other methods.

A small fraction (about one in 1000) of free neutrons decay with the same
products, but add an extra particle in the form of an emitted gamma ray:

  n0 → p+ + e− + ν
  e + γ

This gamma ray may be thought of as a sort of "internal bremsstrahlung"
that arises as the emitted beta particle interacts with the charge of the
proton in an electromagnetic way. Internal bremsstrahlung gamma ray
production is also a minor feature of beta decays of bound neutrons (as
discussed below).

A very small minority of neutron decays (about four per million) are
so-called "two-body (neutron) decays", in which a proton, electron and
antineutrino are produced as usual, but the electron fails to gain the 13.6
eV necessary energy to escape the proton, and therefore simply remains
bound to it, as a neutral hydrogen atom (one of the "two bodies"). In this
type of free neutron decay, in essence all of the neutron decay energy is
carried off by the antineutrino (the other "body").

The transformation of a free proton to a neutron (plus a positron and a
neutrino) is energetically impossible, since a free neutron has a greater
mass than a free proton.

Bound neutron decay

Main article: Atomic nucleus

While a free neutron has a half life of about 10.2 min, most neutrons
within nuclei are stable. According to the nuclear shell model, the protons
and neutrons of a nuclide are a quantum mechanical system organized into
discrete energy levels with unique quantum numbers. For a neutron to decay,
the resulting proton requires an available state at lower energy than the
initial neutron state. In stable nuclei the possible lower energy states
are all filled, meaning they are each occupied by two protons with spin up
and spin down. The Pauli exclusion principle therefore disallows the decay
of a neutron to a proton within stable nuclei. The situation is similar to
electrons of an atom, where electrons have distinct atomic orbitals and are
prevented from decaying to lower energy states, with the emission of a
photon, by the exclusion principle.

Neutrons in unstable nuclei can decay by beta decay as described above. In
this case, an energetically allowed quantum state is available for the
proton resulting from the decay. One example of this decay is carbon-14 (6
protons, 8 neutrons) that decays to nitrogen-14 (7 protons, 7 neutrons)
with a half-life of about 5,730 years.

Inside a nucleus, a proton can transform into a neutron via inverse beta
decay, if an energetically allowed quantum state is available for the
neutron. This transformation occurs by emission of an antielectron (also
called positron) and an electron neutrino:

  p+ → n0 + e+ + ν
  e

The transformation of a proton to a neutron inside of a nucleus is also
possible through electron capture:

  p+ + e− → n0 + ν
  e

Positron capture by neutrons in nuclei that contain an excess of neutrons
is also possible, but is hindered because positrons are repelled by the
positive nucleus, and quickly annihilate when they encounter electrons.

Competition of beta decay types

Three types of beta decay in competition are illustrated by the single
isotope copper-64 (29 protons, 35 neutrons), which has a half-life of about
12.7 hours. This isotope has one unpaired proton and one unpaired neutron,
so either the proton or the neutron can decay. This particular nuclide
(though not all nuclides in this situation) is almost equally likely to
decay through proton decay by positron emission (18%) or electron capture
(43%), as through neutron decay by electron emission (39%).

Intrinsic properties

Electric charge

The total electric charge of the neutron is 0 e. This zero value has been
tested experimentally, and the present experimental limit for the charge of
the neutron is−2(8)×10−22 e,⁴⁹   or −3(13)×10−41 C. This value is
consistent with zero, given the experimental uncertainties (indicated in
parentheses). By comparison, the charge of the proton is, of course, +1 e.

Electric dipole moment

Main article: Neutron electric dipole moment

The Standard Model of particle physics predicts a tiny separation of
positive and negative charge within the neutron leading to a permanent
electric dipole moment.⁵⁰ The predicted value is, however, well below the
current sensitivity of experiments. From several unsolved puzzles in
particle physics, it is clear that the Standard Model is not the final and
full description of all particles and their interactions. New theories
going beyond the Standard Model generally lead to much larger predictions
for the electric dipole moment of the neutron. Currently, there are at
least four experiments trying to measure for the first time a finite
neutron electric dipole moment, including:

- Cryogenic neutron EDM experiment being set up at the Institut
  Laue–Langevin⁵¹
- nEDM experiment under construction at the new UCN source at the Paul
  Scherrer Institute⁵²
- nEDM experiment being envisaged at the Spallation Neutron Source⁵³
- nEDM experiment being built at the Institut Laue–Langevin⁵⁴

Magnetic moment

Main article: Neutron magnetic moment

Even though the neutron is a neutral particle, the magnetic moment of a
neutron is not zero. Since the neutron is a neutral particle, it is not
affected by electric fields, but with its magnetic moment it is affected by
magnetic fields. The magnetic moment of the neutron is an indication of its
quark substructure and internal charge distribution.⁵⁵ The value for the
neutron's magnetic moment was first directly measured by Luis Alvarez and
Felix Bloch at Berkeley, California in 1940,⁵⁶ using an extension of the
magnetic resonance methods developed by Rabi. Alvarez and Bloch determined
the magnetic moment of the neutron to be μₙ = −1.93(2) μN, where μN is the
nuclear magneton.

Structure and geometry of charge distribution

An article published in 2007 featuring a model-independent analysis
concluded that the neutron has a negatively charged exterior, a positively
charged middle, and a negative core.⁵⁷ In a simplified classical view, the
negative "skin" of the neutron assists it to be attracted to the protons
with which it interacts in the nucleus. (However, the main attraction
between neutrons and protons is via the nuclear force, which does not
involve charge.)

The simplified classical view of the neutron's charge distribution also
"explains" the fact that the neutron magnetic dipole points in the opposite
direction from its spin angular momentum vector (as compared to the
proton). This gives the neutron, in effect, a magnetic moment which
resembles a negatively charged particle. This can be reconciled classically
with a neutral neutron composed of a charge distribution in which the
negative sub-parts of the neutron have a larger average radius of
distribution, and therefore contribute more to the particle's magnetic
dipole moment, than do the positive parts that are, on average, nearer the
core.

Mass

The mass of a neutron cannot be directly determined by mass spectrometry
due to lack of electric charge. However, since the mass of protons and
deuterons can be measured by mass spectrometry, the mass of a neutron can
be deduced by subtracting proton mass from deuteron mass, with the
difference being the mass of the neutron plus the binding energy of
deuterium (expressed as a positive emitted energy). The latter can be
directly measured by measuring the energy (B_d) of the single 0.7822 MeV
gamma photon emitted when neutrons are captured by protons (this is
exothermic and happens with zero-energy neutrons), plus the small recoil
kinetic energy (E_{rd}) of the deuteron (about 0.06% of the total energy).

mₙ ₌ ₘ_d - mₚ ₊ B_d - E_{rd}

The energy of the gamma ray can be measured to high precision by X-ray
diffraction techniques, as was first done by Bell and Elliot in 1948. The
best modern (1986) values for neutron mass by this technique are provided
by Greene, et al.⁵⁸ These give a neutron mass of:

  mneutron = 1.008644904(14) u

The value for the neutron mass in MeV is less accurately known, due to less
accuracy in the known conversion of u to MeV:⁵⁹

  mneutron = 939.56563(28) MeV/c².

Another method to determine the mass of a neutron starts from the beta
decay of the neutron, when the momenta of the resulting proton and electron
are measured.

Anti-neutron

Main article: Antineutron

The antineutron is the antiparticle of the neutron. It was discovered by
Bruce Cork in the year 1956, a year after the antiproton was discovered.
CPT-symmetry puts strong constraints on the relative properties of
particles and antiparticles, so studying antineutrons yields provide
stringent tests on CPT-symmetry. The fractional difference in the masses of
the neutron and antineutron is (9±6)×10−5. Since the difference is only
about two standard deviations away from zero, this does not give any
convincing evidence of CPT-violation.¹³

Neutron compounds

Dineutrons and tetraneutrons

Main articles: Dineutron and Tetraneutron

The existence of stable clusters of 4 neutrons, or tetraneutrons, has been
hypothesised by a team led by Francisco-Miguel Marqués at the CNRS
Laboratory for Nuclear Physics based on observations of the disintegration
of beryllium-14 nuclei. This is particularly interesting because current
theory suggests that these clusters should not be stable.

The dineutron is another hypothetical particle. In 2012, Artemis Spyrou
from Michigan State University and coworkers reported that they observed,
for the first time, the dineutron emission in the decay of ¹⁶Be. The
dineutron character is evidenced by a small emission angle between the two
neutrons. The authors measured the two-neutron separation energy to be
1.35(10) MeV, in good agreement with shell model calculations, using
standard interactions for this mass region.⁶⁰

Neutronium and neutron stars

Main articles: Neutronium and Neutron star

At extremely high pressures and temperatures, nucleons and electrons are
believed to collapse into bulk neutronic matter, called neutronium. This is
presumed to happen in neutron stars.

The extreme pressure inside a neutron star may deform the neutrons into a
cubic symmetry, allowing tighter packing of neutrons.⁶¹

Detection

Main article: Neutron detection

The common means of detecting a charged particle by looking for a track of
ionization (such as in a cloud chamber) does not work for neutrons
directly. Neutrons that elastically scatter off atoms can create an
ionization track that is detectable, but the experiments are not as simple
to carry out; other means for detecting neutrons, consisting of allowing
them to interact with atomic nuclei, are more commonly used. The commonly
used methods to detect neutrons can therefore be categorized according to
the nuclear processes relied upon, mainly neutron capture or elastic
scattering. A good discussion on neutron detection is found in chapter 14
of the book Radiation Detection and Measurement by Glenn F. Knoll (John
Wiley & Sons, 1979).

Neutron detection by neutron capture

A common method for detecting neutrons involves converting the energy
released from neutron capture reactions into electrical signals. Certain
nuclides have a high neutron capture cross section, which is the
probability of absorbing a neutron. Upon neutron capture, the compound
nucleus emits more easily detectable radiation, for example an alpha
particle, which is then detected. The nuclides 3He, 6Li, 10B, 233U, 235U,
237Np and 239Pu are useful for this purpose.

Neutron detection by elastic scattering

Neutrons can elastically scatter off nuclei, causing the struck nucleus to
recoil. Kinematically, a neutron can transfer more energy to light nuclei
such as hydrogen or helium than to heavier nuclei. Detectors relying on
elastic scattering are called fast neutron detectors. Recoiling nuclei can
ionize and excite further atoms through collisions. Charge and/or
scintillation light produced in this way can be collected to produce a
detected signal. A major challenge in fast neutron detection is discerning
such signals from erroneous signals produced by gamma radiation in the same
detector.

Fast neutron detectors have the advantage of not requiring a moderator, and
therefore being capable of measuring the neutron's energy, time of arrival,
and in certain cases direction of incidence.

Sources and production

Main articles: Neutron source, neutron generator and research reactor

Free neutrons are unstable, although they have the longest half-life of any
unstable sub-atomic particle by several orders of magnitude. Their
half-life is still only about 10 minutes, however, so they can be obtained
only from sources that produce them freshly.

Natural neutron background. A small natural background flux of free
neutrons exists everywhere on Earth. In the atmosphere and deep into the
ocean, the "neutron background" is caused by muons produced by cosmic ray
interaction with the atmosphere. These high energy muons are capable of
penetration to considerable depths in water and soil. There, in striking
atomic nuclei, among other reactions they induce spallation reactions in
which a neutron is liberated from the nucleus. Within the Earth's crust a
second source is neutrons produced primarily by spontaneous fission of
uranium and thorium present in crustal minerals. The neutron background is
not strong enough to be a biological hazard, but it is of importance to
very high resolution particle detectors that are looking for very rare
events, such as (hypothesized) interactions that might be caused by
particles of dark matter.⁹ Recent research has shown that even
thunderstorms can produce neutrons with energies of up to several tens of
MeV.⁶²

Even stronger neutron background radiation is produced at the surface of
Mars, where the atmosphere is thick enough to generate neutrons from cosmic
ray muon production and neutron-spallation, but not thick enough to provide
significant protection from the neutrons produced. These neutrons not only
produce a Martian surface neutron radiation hazard from direct
downward-going neutron radiation but may also produce a significant hazard
from reflection of neutrons from the Martian surface, which will produce
reflected neutron radiation penetrating upward into a Martian craft or
habitat from the floor.⁶³

Sources of neutrons for research. These include certain types of
radioactive decay (spontaneous fission and neutron emission), and from
certain nuclear reactions. Convenient nuclear reactions include tabletop
reactions such as natural alpha and gamma bombardment of certain nuclides,
often beryllium or deuterium, and induced nuclear fission, such as occurs
in nuclear reactors. In addition, high-energy nuclear reactions (such as
occur in cosmic radiation showers or accelerator collisions) also produce
neutrons from disintigration of target nuclei. Small (tabletop) particle
accelerators optimized to produce free neutrons in this way, are called
neutron generators.

In practice, the most commonly used small laboratory sources of neutrons
use radioactive decay to power neutron production. One noted
neutron-producing radioisotope, californium-252 decays (half-life 2.65
years) by spontaneous fission 3% of the time with production of 3.7
neutrons per fission, and is used alone as a neutron source from this
process. Nuclear reaction sources (that involve two materials) powered by
radioisotopes use an alpha decay source plus a beryllium target, or else a
source of high-energy gamma radiation from a source that undergoes beta
decay followed by gamma decay, which produces photoneutrons on interaction
of the high energy gamma ray with ordinary stable beryllium, or else with
the deuterium in heavy water. A popular source of the latter type is
radioactive antimony-124 plus beryllium, a system with a half-life of 60.9
days, which can be constructed from natural antimony (which is 42.8% stable
antimony-123) by activating it with neutrons in a nuclear reactor, then
transported to where the neutron source is needed.⁶⁴

Nuclear fission reactors naturally produce free neutrons; their role is to
sustain the energy-producing chain reaction. The intense neutron radiation
can also be used to produce various radioisotopes through the process of
neutron activation, which is a type of neutron capture.

Experimental nuclear fusion reactors produce free neutrons as a waste
product. However, it is these neutrons that possess most of the energy, and
converting that energy to a useful form has proved a difficult engineering
challenge. Fusion reactors that generate neutrons are likely to create
radioactive waste, but the waste is composed of neutron-activated lighter
isotopes, which have relatively short (50–100 years) decay periods as
compared to typical half-lives of 10,000 years for fission waste, which is
long due primarily to the long half-life of alpha-emitting transuranic
actinides.⁶⁵

Neutron beams and modification of beams after production

Free neutron beams are obtained from neutron sources by neutron transport.
For access to intense neutron sources, researchers must go to a specialist
neutron facility that operates a research reactor or a spallation source.

The neutron's lack of total electric charge makes it difficult to steer or
accelerate them. Charged particles can be accelerated, decelerated, or
deflected by electric or magnetic fields. These methods have little effect
on neutrons. However, some effects may be attained by use of inhomogeneous
magnetic fields because of the neutron's magnetic moment. Neutrons can be
controlled by methods that include moderation, reflection, and velocity
selection. Thermal neutrons can be polarized by transmission through
magnetic materials in a method analogous to the Faraday effect for photons.
Cold neutrons of wavelengths of 6–7 angstroms can be produced in beams of a
high degree of polarization, by use of magnetic mirrors and magnetized
interference filters.⁶⁶

Applications

The neutron plays an important role in many nuclear reactions. For example,
neutron capture often results in neutron activation, inducing
radioactivity. In particular, knowledge of neutrons and their behavior has
been important in the development of nuclear reactors and nuclear weapons.
The fissioning of elements like uranium-235 and plutonium-239 is caused by
their absorption of neutrons.

Cold, thermal and hot neutron radiation is commonly employed in neutron
scattering facilities, where the radiation is used in a similar way one
uses X-rays for the analysis of condensed matter. Neutrons are
complementary to the latter in terms of atomic contrasts by different
scattering cross sections; sensitivity to magnetism; energy range for
inelastic neutron spectroscopy; and deep penetration into matter.

The development of "neutron lenses" based on total internal reflection
within hollow glass capillary tubes or by reflection from dimpled aluminum
plates has driven ongoing research into neutron microscopy and
neutron/gamma ray tomography.⁶⁷ ⁶⁸ ⁶⁹

A major use of neutrons is to excite delayed and prompt gamma rays from
elements in materials. This forms the basis of neutron activation analysis
(NAA) and prompt gamma neutron activation analysis (PGNAA). NAA is most
often used to analyze small samples of materials in a nuclear reactor
whilst PGNAA is most often used to analyze subterranean rocks around bore
holes and industrial bulk materials on conveyor belts.

Another use of neutron emitters is the detection of light nuclei, in
particular the hydrogen found in water molecules. When a fast neutron
collides with a light nucleus, it loses a large fraction of its energy. By
measuring the rate at which slow neutrons return to the probe after
reflecting off of hydrogen nuclei, a neutron probe may determine the water
content in soil.

Medical therapies

Main articles: Fast neutron therapy and Neutron capture therapy of cancer

Because neutron radiation is both penetrating and ionizing, it can be
exploited for medical treatments. Neutron radiation can have the
unfortunate side-effect of leaving the affected area radioactive, however.
Neutron tomography is therefore not a viable medical application.

Fast neutron therapy utilizes high energy neutrons typically greater than
20 MeV to treat cancer. Radiation therapy of cancers is based upon the
biological response of cells to ionizing radiation. If radiation is
delivered in small sessions to damage cancerous areas, normal tissue will
have time to repair itself, while tumor cells often cannot.⁷⁰ Neutron
radiation can deliver energy to a cancerous region at a rate an order of
magnitude larger than gamma radiation⁷¹

Beams of low energy neutrons are used in boron capture therapy to treat
cancer. In boron capture therapy, the patient is given a drug that contains
boron and that preferentially accumulates in the tumor to be targeted. The
tumor is then bombarded with very low energy neutrons (although often
higher than thermal energy) which are captured by the boron-10 isotope in
the boron, which produces an excited state of boron-11 that then decays to
produce lithium-7 and an alpha particle that have sufficient energy to kill
the malignant cell, but insufficient range to damage nearby cells. For such
a therapy to be applied to the treatment of cancer, a neutron source having
an intensity of the order of billion (10⁹) neutrons per second per cm² is
preferred. Such fluxes require a research nuclear reactor.

Protection

Exposure to free neutrons can be hazardous, since the interaction of
neutrons with molecules in the body can cause disruption to molecules and
atoms, and can also cause reactions that give rise to other forms of
radiation (such as protons). The normal precautions of radiation protection
apply: Avoid exposure, stay as far from the source as possible, and keep
exposure time to a minimum. Some particular thought must be given to how to
protect from neutron exposure, however. For other types of radiation, e.g.
alpha particles, beta particles, or gamma rays, material of a high atomic
number and with high density make for good shielding; frequently, lead is
used. However, this approach will not work with neutrons, since the
absorption of neutrons does not increase straightforwardly with atomic
number, as it does with alpha, beta, and gamma radiation. Instead one needs
to look at the particular interactions neutrons have with matter (see the
section on detection above). For example, hydrogen-rich materials are often
used to shield against neutrons, since ordinary hydrogen both scatters and
slows neutrons. This often means that simple concrete blocks or even
paraffin-loaded plastic blocks afford better protection from neutrons than
do far more dense materials. After slowing, neutrons may then be absorbed
with an isotope that has high affinity for slow neutrons without causing
secondary capture radiation, such as lithium-6.

Hydrogen-rich ordinary water affects neutron absorption in nuclear fission
reactors: Usually, neutrons are so strongly absorbed by normal water that
fuel enrichment with fissionable isotope is required. The deuterium in
heavy water has a very much lower absorption affinity for neutrons than
does protium (normal light hydrogen). Deuterium is, therefore, used in
CANDU-type reactors, in order to slow (moderate) neutron velocity, to
increase the probability of nuclear fission compared to neutron capture.

Neutron temperature

Main article: Neutron temperature

Thermal neutrons

A thermal neutron is a free neutron that is Boltzmann distributed with kT =
0.0253 eV (4.0×10−21 J) at room temperature. This gives characteristic (not
average, or median) speed of 2.2 km/s. The name 'thermal' comes from their
energy being that of the room temperature gas or material they are
permeating. (see kinetic theory for energies and speeds of molecules).
After a number of collisions (often in the range of 10–20) with nuclei,
neutrons arrive at this energy level, provided that they are not absorbed.

In many substances, thermal neutron reactions show a much larger effective
cross-section than reactions involving faster neutrons, and thermal
neutrons can therefore be absorbed more readily (i.e., with higher
probability) by any atomic nuclei that they collide with, creating a
heavier — and often unstable — isotope of the chemical element as a result.

Most fission reactors use a neutron moderator to slow down, or thermalize
the neutrons that are emitted by nuclear fission so that they are more
easily captured, causing further fission. Others, called fast breeder
reactors, use fission energy neutrons directly.

Cold neutrons

Cold neutrons are thermal neutrons that have been equilibrated in a very
cold substance such as liquid deuterium. Such a cold source is placed in
the moderator of a research reactor or spallation source. Cold neutrons are
particularly valuable for neutron scattering experiments.

Ultracold neutrons

Ultracold neutrons are produced by inelastically scattering cold neutrons
in substances with a temperature of a few kelvins, such as solid deuterium
or superfluid helium. An alternative production method is the mechanical
deceleration of cold neutrons.

Fission energy neutrons

Main article: nuclear fission

A fast neutron is a free neutron with a kinetic energy level close to 1 MeV
(1.6×10−13 J), hence a speed of ~14000 km/s (~ 5% of the speed of light).
They are named fission energy or fast neutrons to distinguish them from
lower-energy thermal neutrons, and high-energy neutrons produced in cosmic
showers or accelerators. Fast neutrons are produced by nuclear processes
such as nuclear fission. Neutrons produced in fission, as noted above, have
a Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution of kinetic energies from 0 to ~14 MeV, a
mean energy of 2 MeV (for U-235 fission neutrons), and a mode of only 0.75
MeV, which means that more than half of them do not qualify as fast (and
thus have almost no chance of initiating fission in fertile materials, such
as U-238 and Th-232).

Fast neutrons can be made into thermal neutrons via a process called
moderation. This is done with a neutron moderator. In reactors, typically
heavy water, light water, or graphite are used to moderate neutrons.

Fusion neutrons

For more details on this topic, see Nuclear fusion § Criteria and
candidates for terrestrial reactions.

D–T (deuterium–tritium) fusion is the fusion reaction that produces the
most energetic neutrons, with 14.1 MeV of kinetic energy and traveling at
17% of the speed of light. D–T fusion is also the easiest fusion reaction
to ignite, reaching near-peak rates even when the deuterium and tritium
nuclei have only a thousandth as much kinetic energy as the 14.1 MeV that
will be produced.

14.1 MeV neutrons have about 10 times as much energy as fission neutrons,
and are very effective at fissioning even non-fissile heavy nuclei, and
these high-energy fissions produce more neutrons on average than fissions
by lower-energy neutrons. This makes D–T fusion neutron sources such as
proposed tokamak power reactors useful for transmutation of transuranic
waste. 14.1 MeV neutrons can also produce neutrons by knocking them loose
from nuclei.

On the other hand, these very high energy neutrons are less likely to
simply be captured without causing fission or spallation. For these
reasons, nuclear weapon design extensively utilizes D–T fusion 14.1 MeV
neutrons to cause more fission. Fusion neutrons are able to cause fission
in ordinarily non-fissile materials, such as depleted uranium
(uranium-238), and these materials have been used in the jackets of
thermonuclear weapons. Fusion neutrons also can cause fission in substances
that are unsuitable or difficult to make into primary fission bombs, such
as reactor grade plutonium. This physical fact thus causes ordinary
non-weapons grade materials to become of concern in certain nuclear
proliferation discussions and treaties.

Other fusion reactions produce much less energetic neutrons. D–D fusion
produces a 2.45 MeV neutron and helium-3 half of the time, and produces
tritium and a proton but no neutron the other half of the time. D–³He
fusion produces no neutron.

Intermediate-energy neutrons

A fission energy neutron that has slowed down but not yet reached thermal
energies is called an epithermal neutron.

Cross sections for both capture and fission reactions often have multiple
resonance peaks at specific energies in the epithermal energy range. These
are of less significance in a fast neutron reactor, where most neutrons are
absorbed before slowing down to this range, or in a well-moderated thermal
reactor, where epithermal neutrons interact mostly with moderator nuclei,
not with either fissile or fertile actinide nuclides. However, in a
partially moderated reactor with more interactions of epithermal neutrons
with heavy metal nuclei, there are greater possibilities for transient
changes in reactivity that might make reactor control more difficult.

Ratios of capture reactions to fission reactions are also worse (more
captures without fission) in most nuclear fuels such as plutonium-239,
making epithermal-spectrum reactors using these fuels less desirable, as
captures not only waste the one neutron captured but also usually result in
a nuclide that is not fissile with thermal or epithermal neutrons, though
still fissionable with fast neutrons. The exception is uranium-233 of the
thorium cycle, which has good capture-fission ratios at all neutron
energies.

High-energy neutrons

These neutrons have much more energy than fission energy neutrons and are
generated as secondary particles by particle accelerators or in the
atmosphere from cosmic rays. They can have energies as high as tens of
joules per neutron. These neutrons are extremely efficient at ionization
and far more likely to cause cell death than X-rays or protons.⁷² ⁷³

  2011 partial update for the 2012 editionThe exact value of the mean
  lifetime is still uncertain, due to conflicting results from experiments.
  The Particle Data Group reports values up to six seconds apart (more than
  four standard deviations), commenting that "our 2006, 2008, and 2010
  Reviews stayed with 885.7±0.8 s; but we noted that in light of SEREBROV
  05 our value should be regarded as suspect until further experiments
  clarified matters. Since our 2010 Review, PICHLMAIER 10 has obtained a
  mean life of 880.7±1.8 s, closer to the value of SEREBROV 05 than to our
  average. And SEREBROV 10B[...] claims their values should be lowered by
  about 6 s, which would bring them into line with the two lower values.
  However, those reevaluations have not received an enthusiastic response
  from the experimenters in question; and in any case the Particle Data
  Group would have to await published changes (by those experimenters) of
  published values. At this point, we can think of nothing better to do
  than to average the seven best but discordant measurements, getting
  881.5±1.5s. Note that the error includes a scale factor of 2.7. This is a
  jump of 4.2 old (and 2.8 new) standard deviations. This state of affairs
  is a particularly unhappy one, because the value is so important. We
  again call upon the experimenters to clear this up."

Nuclear fusion

In nuclear physics, nuclear fusion is a nuclear reaction in which two or
more atomic nuclei come very close and then collide at a very high speed
and join to form a new nucleus. During this process, matter is not
conserved because some of the matter of the fusing nuclei is converted to
photons (energy). Fusion is the process that powers active or "main
sequence" stars.

The fusion of two nuclei with lower masses than Iron-56 (which, along with
Nickel-62, has the largest binding energy per nucleon) generally releases
energy, while the fusion of nuclei heavier than iron absorbs energy. The
opposite is true for the reverse process, nuclear fission. This means that
fusion generally occurs for lighter elements only, and likewise, that
fission normally occurs only for heavier elements. There are extreme
astrophysical events that can lead to short periods of fusion with heavier
nuclei. This is the process that gives rise to nucleosynthesis, the
creation of the heavy elements during events such as supernova.

Following the discovery of quantum tunneling by Friedrich Hund, in 1929
Robert Atkinson and Fritz Houtermans used the measured masses of light
elements to predict that large amounts of energy could be released by
fusing small nuclei. Building upon the nuclear transmutation experiments by
Ernest Rutherford, carried out several years earlier, the laboratory fusion
of hydrogen isotopes was first accomplished by Mark Oliphant in 1932.
During the remainder of that decade the steps of the main cycle of nuclear
fusion in stars were worked out by Hans Bethe. Research into fusion for
military purposes began in the early 1940s as part of the Manhattan
Project. Fusion was accomplished in 1951 with the Greenhouse Item nuclear
test. Nuclear fusion on a large scale in an explosion was first carried out
on November 1, 1952, in the Ivy Mike hydrogen bomb test.

Research into developing controlled thermonuclear fusion for civil purposes
also began in earnest in the 1950s, and it continues to this day. The
present article is about the theory of fusion. For details of the quest for
controlled fusion and its history, see the article Fusion power.

Process

The origin of the energy released in fusion of light elements is due to
interplay of two opposing forces, the nuclear force which combines together
protons and neutrons, and the Coulomb force which causes protons to repel
each other. The protons are positively charged and repel each other but
they nonetheless stick together, demonstrating the existence of another
force referred to as nuclear attraction. This force, called the strong
nuclear force, overcomes electric repulsion in a very close range. The
effect of this force is not observed outside the nucleus, hence the force
has a strong dependence on distance, making it a short-range force. The
same force also pulls the nucleons together, or neutrons and protons
together.² Because the nuclear force is stronger than the Coulomb force for
atomic nuclei smaller than iron and nickel, building up these nuclei from
lighter nuclei by fusion releases the extra energy from the net attraction
of these particles. For larger nuclei, however, no energy is released,
since the nuclear force is short-range and cannot continue to act across
still larger atomic nuclei. Thus, energy is no longer released when such
nuclei are made by fusion; instead, energy is absorbed in such processes.

Fusion reactions of light elements power the stars and produce virtually
all elements in a process called nucleosynthesis. The fusion of lighter
elements in stars releases energy (and the mass that always accompanies
it). For example, in the fusion of two hydrogen nuclei to form helium, 0.7%
of the mass is carried away from the system in the form of kinetic energy
or other forms of energy (such as electromagnetic radiation).³

Research into controlled fusion, with the aim of producing fusion power for
the production of electricity, has been conducted for over 60 years. It has
been accompanied by extreme scientific and technological difficulties, but
has resulted in progress. At present, controlled fusion reactions have been
unable to produce break-even (self-sustaining) controlled fusion
reactions.⁴ Workable designs for a reactor that theoretically will deliver
ten times more fusion energy than the amount needed to heat up plasma to
required temperatures are in development (see ITER). The ITER facility is
expected to finish its construction phase in 2019. It will start
commissioning the reactor that same year and initiate plasma experiments in
2020, but is not expected to begin full deuterium-tritium fusion until
2027.⁵

It takes considerable energy to force nuclei to fuse, even those of the
lightest element, hydrogen. This is because all nuclei have a positive
charge due to their protons, and as like charges repel, nuclei strongly
resist being put close together. Accelerated to high speeds, they can
overcome this electrostatic repulsion and be forced close enough for the
attractive nuclear force to be sufficiently strong to achieve fusion. The
fusion of lighter nuclei, which creates a heavier nucleus and often a free
neutron or proton, generally releases more energy than it takes to force
the nuclei together; this is an exothermic process that can produce
self-sustaining reactions. The US National Ignition Facility, which uses
laser-driven inertial confinement fusion, is thought to be capable of
break-even fusion.

The first large-scale laser target experiments were performed in June 2009
and ignition experiments began in early 2011.⁶ ⁷

Energy released in most nuclear reactions is much larger than in chemical
reactions, because the binding energy that holds a nucleus together is far
greater than the energy that holds electrons to a nucleus. For example, the
ionization energy gained by adding an electron to a hydrogen nucleus is
13.6 eV—less than one-millionth of the 17.6 MeV released in the
deuterium–tritium (D–T) reaction shown in the diagram to the right (one
gram of matter would release 339 GJ of energy). Fusion reactions have an
energy density many times greater than nuclear fission; the reactions
produce far greater energy per unit of mass even though individual fission
reactions are generally much more energetic than individual fusion ones,
which are themselves millions of times more energetic than chemical
reactions. Only direct conversion of mass into energy, such as that caused
by the annihilatory collision of matter and antimatter, is more energetic
per unit of mass than nuclear fusion.

Nuclear fusion in stars

The most important fusion process in nature is the one that powers stars.
In the 20th century, it was realized that the energy released from nuclear
fusion reactions accounted for the longevity of the Sun and other stars as
a source of heat and light. The fusion of nuclei in a star, starting from
its initial hydrogen and helium abundance, provides that energy and
synthesizes new nuclei as a byproduct of that fusion process. The prime
energy producer in the Sun is the fusion of hydrogen to form helium, which
occurs at a solar-core temperature of 14 million kelvin. The net result is
the fusion of four protons into one alpha particle, with the release of two
positrons, two neutrinos (which changes two of the protons into neutrons),
and energy. Different reaction chains are involved, depending on the mass
of the star. For stars the size of the sun or smaller, the proton-proton
chain dominates. In heavier stars, the CNO cycle is more important.

As a star uses up a substantial fraction of its hydrogen, it begins to
synthesize heavier elements, as part of stellar nucleosynthesis. However
the heaviest elements are synthesized by fusion that occurs as a more
massive star undergoes a violent supernova at the end of its life, a
process known as supernova nucleosynthesis.

Requirements

Details and supporting references on the material in this section can be
found in textbooks on nuclear physics or nuclear fusion.⁸

A substantial energy barrier of electrostatic forces must be overcome
before fusion can occur. At large distances, two naked nuclei repel one
another because of the repulsive electrostatic force between their
positively charged protons. If two nuclei can be brought close enough
together, however, the electrostatic repulsion can be overcome by the
attractive nuclear force, which is stronger at close distances.

When a nucleon such as a proton or neutron is added to a nucleus, the
nuclear force attracts it to other nucleons, but primarily to its immediate
neighbours due to the short range of the force. The nucleons in the
interior of a nucleus have more neighboring nucleons than those on the
surface. Since smaller nuclei have a larger surface area-to-volume ratio,
the binding energy per nucleon due to the nuclear force generally increases
with the size of the nucleus but approaches a limiting value corresponding
to that of a nucleus with a diameter of about four nucleons. It is
important to keep in mind that the above picture is a toy model because
nucleons are quantum objects, and so, for example, since two neutrons in a
nucleus are identical to each other, distinguishing one from the other,
such as which one is in the interior and which is on the surface, is in
fact meaningless, and the inclusion of quantum mechanics is necessary for
proper calculations.

The electrostatic force, on the other hand, is an inverse-square force, so
a proton added to a nucleus will feel an electrostatic repulsion from all
the other protons in the nucleus. The electrostatic energy per nucleon due
to the electrostatic force thus increases without limit as nuclei get
larger.

The net result of these opposing forces is that the binding energy per
nucleon generally increases with increasing size, up to the elements iron
and nickel, and then decreases for heavier nuclei. Eventually, the binding
energy becomes negative and very heavy nuclei (all with more than 208
nucleons, corresponding to a diameter of about 6 nucleons) are not stable.
The four most tightly bound nuclei, in decreasing order of binding energy
per nucleon, are 62Ni, 58Fe, 56Fe, and 60Ni.⁹ Even though the nickel
isotope, 62Ni, is more stable, the iron isotope 56Fe is an order of
magnitude more common. This is due to the fact that there is no easy way
for stars to create 62Ni through the alpha process.

An exception to this general trend is the helium-4 nucleus, whose binding
energy is higher than that of lithium, the next heaviest element. This is
because protons and neutrons are fermions, which according to the Pauli
exclusion principle cannot exist in the same nucleus in exactly the same
state. Each proton or neutron energy state in a nucleus can accommodate
both a spin up particle and a spin down particle. Helium-4 has an
anomalously large binding energy because its nucleus consists of two
protons and two neutrons, so all four of its nucleons can be in the ground
state. Any additional nucleons would have to go into higher energy states.
Indeed, the helium-4 nucleus is so tightly bound that it is commonly
treated as a single particle in nuclear physics, namely, the alpha
particle.

The situation is similar if two nuclei are brought together. As they
approach each other, all the protons in one nucleus repel all the protons
in the other. Not until the two nuclei actually come in contact can the
strong nuclear force take over. Consequently, even when the final energy
state is lower, there is a large energy barrier that must first be
overcome. It is called the Coulomb barrier.

The Coulomb barrier is smallest for isotopes of hydrogen, as their nuclei
contain only a single positive charge. A diproton is not stable, so
neutrons must also be involved, ideally in such a way that a helium
nucleus, with its extremely tight binding, is one of the products.

Using deuterium-tritium fuel, the resulting energy barrier is about 0.1
MeV. In comparison, the energy needed to remove an electron from hydrogen
is 13.6 eV, about 7500 times less energy. The (intermediate) result of the
fusion is an unstable ⁵He nucleus, which immediately ejects a neutron with
14.1 MeV. The recoil energy of the remaining ⁴He nucleus is 3.5 MeV, so the
total energy liberated is 17.6 MeV. This is many times more than what was
needed to overcome the energy barrier.

The reaction cross section σ is a measure of the probability of a fusion
reaction as a function of the relative velocity of the two reactant nuclei.
If the reactants have a distribution of velocities, e.g. a thermal
distribution, then it is useful to perform an average over the
distributions of the product of cross section and velocity. This average is
called the 'reactivity', denoted <σv>. The reaction rate (fusions per
volume per time) is <σv> times the product of the reactant number
densities:

f = n_1 n_2 \langle σv \rangle .

If a species of nuclei is reacting with itself, such as the DD reaction,
then the product n₁ₙ₂ must be replaced by (1/2)n².

\langle σv \rangle increases from virtually zero at room temperatures up to
meaningful magnitudes at temperatures of 10–100 keV. At these temperatures,
well above typical ionization energies (13.6 eV in the hydrogen case), the
fusion reactants exist in a plasma state.

The significance of \langle σv \rangle as a function of temperature in a
device with a particular energy confinement time is found by considering
the Lawson criterion. This is an extremely challenging barrier to overcome
on Earth, which explains why fusion research has taken many years to reach
the current high state of technical prowess.¹⁰

Methods for achieving fusion

Main article: Fusion power

Thermonuclear fusion

Main article: Thermonuclear fusion

If the matter is sufficiently heated (hence being plasma), the fusion
reaction may occur due to collisions with extreme thermal kinetic energies
of the particles. In the form of thermonuclear weapons, thermonuclear
fusion is the only fusion technique so far to yield undeniably large
amounts of useful fusion energy. Usable amounts of thermonuclear fusion
energy released in a controlled manner have yet to be achieved. In nature,
this is what produces energy in stars through stellar nucleosynthesis.

Inertial confinement fusion

Main article: Inertial confinement fusion

Inertial confinement fusion (ICF) is a type of fusion energy research that
attempts to initiate nuclear fusion reactions by heating and compressing a
fuel target, typically in the form of a pellet that most often contains a
mixture of deuterium and tritium.

Inertial electrostatic confinement

Main article: Inertial electrostatic confinement

Inertial electrostatic confinement is a set of devices that use an electric
field to heat ions to fusion conditions. The most well known is the fusor.
Starting in 1999, a number of amateurs have been able to do amateur fusion
using these homemade devices.¹¹ ¹² ¹³ ¹⁴ ¹⁵ Other IEC devices include: the
Polywell, MIX POPS¹⁶ and Marble ¹⁷ concepts.

Beam-beam or beam-target fusion

If the energy to initiate the reaction comes from accelerating one of the
nuclei, the process is called beam-target fusion; if both nuclei are
accelerated, it is beam-beam fusion.

Accelerator-based light-ion fusion is a technique using particle
accelerators to achieve particle kinetic energies sufficient to induce
light-ion fusion reactions. Accelerating light ions is relatively easy, and
can be done in an efficient manner—all it takes is a vacuum tube, a pair of
electrodes, and a high-voltage transformer; fusion can be observed with as
little as 10 kV between electrodes. The key problem with accelerator-based
fusion (and with cold targets in general) is that fusion cross sections are
many orders of magnitude lower than Coulomb interaction cross sections.
Therefore, the vast majority of ions end up expending their energy on
bremsstrahlung and ionization of atoms of the target. Devices referred to
as sealed-tube neutron generators are particularly relevant to this
discussion. These small devices are miniature particle accelerators filled
with deuterium and tritium gas in an arrangement that allows ions of these
nuclei to be accelerated against hydride targets, also containing deuterium
and tritium, where fusion takes place. Hundreds of neutron generators are
produced annually for use in the petroleum industry where they are used in
measurement equipment for locating and mapping oil reserves.

Muon-catalyzed fusion

Muon-catalyzed fusion is a well-established and reproducible fusion process
that occurs at ordinary temperatures. It was studied in detail by Steven
Jones in the early 1980s. Net energy production from this reaction cannot
occur because of the high energy required to create muons, their short 2.2
µs half-life, and the high chance that a muon will bind to the new alpha
particle and thus stop catalyzing fusion.¹⁸

Other principles

Some other confinement principles have been investigated.

Antimatter-initialized fusion uses small amounts of antimatter to trigger a
tiny fusion explosion. This has been studied primarily in the context of
making nuclear pulse propulsion, and pure fusion bombs feasible. This is
not near becoming a practical power source, due to the cost of
manufacturing antimatter alone.

Pyroelectric fusion was reported in April 2005 by a team at UCLA. The
scientists used a pyroelectric crystal heated from −34 to 7 °C (−29 to 45
°F), combined with a tungsten needle to produce an electric field of about
25 gigavolts per meter to ionize and accelerate deuterium nuclei into an
erbium deuteride target. At the estimated energy levels,¹⁹ the D-D fusion
reaction may occur, producing helium-3 and a 2.45 MeV neutron. Although it
makes a useful neutron generator, the apparatus is not intended for power
generation since it requires far more energy than it produces.²⁰ ²¹ ²² ²³

Hybrid nuclear fusion-fission (hybrid nuclear power) is a proposed means of
generating power by use of a combination of nuclear fusion and fission
processes. The concept dates to the 1950s, and was briefly advocated by
Hans Bethe during the 1970s, but largely remained unexplored until a
revival of interest in 2009, due to the delays in the realization of pure
fusion.²⁴ Project PACER, carried out at Los Alamos National Laboratory
(LANL) in the mid-1970s, explored the possibility of a fusion power system
that would involve exploding small hydrogen bombs (fusion bombs) inside an
underground cavity. As an energy source, the system is the only fusion
power system that could be demonstrated to work using existing technology.
However it would also require a large, continuous supply of nuclear bombs,
making the economics of such a system rather questionable.

Important reactions

Astrophysical reaction chains

At the temperatures and densities in stellar cores the rates of fusion
reactions are notoriously slow. For example, at solar core temperature (T ≈
15 MK) and density (160 g/cm³), the energy release rate is only 276
μW/cm³—about a quarter of the volumetric rate at which a resting human body
generates heat.²⁵ Thus, reproduction of stellar core conditions in a lab
for nuclear fusion power production is completely impractical. Because
nuclear reaction rates strongly depend on temperature (exp(−E/kT)),
achieving reasonable power levels in terrestrial fusion reactors requires
10–100 times higher temperatures (compared to stellar interiors): T ≈
0.1–1.0 GK.

Criteria and candidates for terrestrial reactions

Main article: Fusion power § Fuels

In artificial fusion, the primary fuel is not constrained to be protons and
higher temperatures can be used, so reactions with larger cross-sections
are chosen. Another concern is the production of neutrons, which activate
the reactor structure radiologically, but also have the advantages of
allowing volumetric extraction of the fusion energy and tritium breeding.
Reactions that release no neutrons are referred to as aneutronic.

To be a useful energy source, a fusion reaction must satisfy several
criteria. It must:

- Be exothermic: This limits the reactants to the low Z (number of protons)
  side of the curve of binding energy. It also makes helium 4He the most
  common product because of its extraordinarily tight binding, although 3He
  and 3H also show up.
- Involve low Z nuclei: This is because the electrostatic repulsion must be
  overcome before the nuclei are close enough to fuse.
- Have two reactants: At anything less than stellar densities, three body
  collisions are too improbable. In inertial confinement, both stellar
  densities and temperatures are exceeded to compensate for the
  shortcomings of the third parameter of the Lawson criterion, ICF's very
  short confinement time.
- Have two or more products: This allows simultaneous conservation of
  energy and momentum without relying on the electromagnetic force.
- Conserve both protons and neutrons: The cross sections for the weak
  interaction are too small.

Few reactions meet these criteria. The following are those with the largest
cross sections:

For reactions with two products, the energy is divided between them in
inverse proportion to their masses, as shown. In most reactions with three
products, the distribution of energy varies. For reactions that can result
in more than one set of products, the branching ratios are given.

Some reaction candidates can be eliminated at once.²⁶ The D-⁶Li reaction
has no advantage compared to p⁺-11
5B because it is roughly as difficult to burn but produces substantially
more neutrons through 2
1D-2
1D side reactions. There is also a p⁺-7
3Li reaction, but the cross section is far too low, except possibly when Ti
> 1 MeV, but at such high temperatures an endothermic, direct
neutron-producing reaction also becomes very significant. Finally there is
also a p⁺-9
4Be reaction, which is not only difficult to burn, but 9
4Be can be easily induced to split into two alpha particles and a neutron.

In addition to the fusion reactions, the following reactions with neutrons
are important in order to "breed" tritium in "dry" fusion bombs and some
proposed fusion reactors:

The latter of the two equations was unknown when the U.S. conducted the
Castle Bravo fusion bomb test in 1954. Being just the second fusion bomb
ever tested (and the first to use lithium), the designers of the Castle
Bravo "Shrimp" had understood the usefulness of Lithium-6 in tritium
production, but had failed to recognize that Lithium-7 fission would
greatly increase the yield of the bomb. While Li-7 has a small neutron
cross-section for low neutron energies, it has a higher cross section above
5 MeV.²⁷ Li-7 also undergoes a chain reaction due to its release of a
neutron after fissioning. The 15 Mt yield was 150% greater than the
predicted 6 Mt and caused casualties from the fallout generated.

To evaluate the usefulness of these reactions, in addition to the
reactants, the products, and the energy released, one needs to know
something about the cross section. Any given fusion device has a maximum
plasma pressure it can sustain, and an economical device would always
operate near this maximum. Given this pressure, the largest fusion output
is obtained when the temperature is chosen so that <σv>/T² is a maximum.
This is also the temperature at which the value of the triple product nTτ
required for ignition is a minimum, since that required value is inversely
proportional to <σv>/T² (see Lawson criterion). (A plasma is "ignited" if
the fusion reactions produce enough power to maintain the temperature
without external heating.) This optimum temperature and the value of
<σv>/T² at that temperature is given for a few of these reactions in the
following table.

Note that many of the reactions form chains. For instance, a reactor fueled
with 3
1T and 3
2He creates some 2
1D, which is then possible to use in the 2
1D-3
2He reaction if the energies are "right". An elegant idea is to combine the
reactions (8) and (9). The 3
2He from reaction (8) can react with 6
3Li in reaction (9) before completely thermalizing. This produces an
energetic proton, which in turn undergoes reaction (8) before thermalizing.
Detailed analysis shows that this idea would not work well, but it is a
good example of a case where the usual assumption of a Maxwellian plasma is
not appropriate.

Neutronicity, confinement requirement, and power density

Any of the reactions above can in principle be the basis of fusion power
production. In addition to the temperature and cross section discussed
above, we must consider the total energy of the fusion products Efus, the
energy of the charged fusion products Ech, and the atomic number Z of the
non-hydrogenic reactant.

Specification of the 2
1D-2
1D reaction entails some difficulties, though. To begin with, one must
average over the two branches (2i) and (2ii). More difficult is to decide
how to treat the 3
1T and 3
2He products. 3
1T burns so well in a deuterium plasma that it is almost impossible to
extract from the plasma. The 2
1D-3
2He reaction is optimized at a much higher temperature, so the burnup at
the optimum 2
1D-2
1D temperature may be low, so it seems reasonable to assume the 3
1T but not the 3
2He gets burned up and adds its energy to the net reaction. Thus the total
reaction would be the sum of (2i), (2ii), and (1):

  5 2
  1D → 4
  2He + 2 n⁰ + 3
  2He + p⁺, Efus = 4.03+17.6+3.27 = 24.9 MeV, Ech = 4.03+3.5+0.82 = 8.35
  MeV.

We count the 2
1D-2
1D fusion energy per D-D reaction (not per pair of deuterium atoms) as Efus
= (4.03 MeV + 17.6 MeV)×50% + (3.27 MeV)×50% = 12.5 MeV and the energy in
charged particles as Ech = (4.03 MeV + 3.5 MeV)×50% + (0.82 MeV)×50% = 4.2
MeV. (Note: if the tritium ion reacts with a deuteron while it still has a
large kinetic energy, then the kinetic energy of the helium-4 produced may
be quite different from 3.5 MeV, so this calculation of energy in charged
particles is only approximate.)

Another unique aspect of the 2
1D-2
1D reaction is that there is only one reactant, which must be taken into
account when calculating the reaction rate.

With this choice, we tabulate parameters for four of the most important
reactions

The last column is the neutronicity of the reaction, the fraction of the
fusion energy released as neutrons. This is an important indicator of the
magnitude of the problems associated with neutrons like radiation damage,
biological shielding, remote handling, and safety. For the first two
reactions it is calculated as (Efus-Ech)/Efus. For the last two reactions,
where this calculation would give zero, the values quoted are rough
estimates based on side reactions that produce neutrons in a plasma in
thermal equilibrium.

Of course, the reactants should also be mixed in the optimal proportions.
This is the case when each reactant ion plus its associated electrons
accounts for half the pressure. Assuming that the total pressure is fixed,
this means that density of the non-hydrogenic ion is smaller than that of
the hydrogenic ion by a factor 2/(Z+1). Therefore, the rate for these
reactions is reduced by the same factor, on top of any differences in the
values of <σv>/T². On the other hand, because the 2
1D-2
1D reaction has only one reactant, its rate is twice as high as when the
fuel is divided between two different hydrogenic species, thus creating a
more efficient reaction.

Thus there is a "penalty" of (2/(Z+1)) for non-hydrogenic fuels arising
from the fact that they require more electrons, which take up pressure
without participating in the fusion reaction. (It is usually a good
assumption that the electron temperature will be nearly equal to the ion
temperature. Some authors, however discuss the possibility that the
electrons could be maintained substantially colder than the ions. In such a
case, known as a "hot ion mode", the "penalty" would not apply.) There is
at the same time a "bonus" of a factor 2 for 2
1D-2
1D because each ion can react with any of the other ions, not just a
fraction of them.

We can now compare these reactions in the following table.

The maximum value of <σv>/T² is taken from a previous table. The
"penalty/bonus" factor is that related to a non-hydrogenic reactant or a
single-species reaction. The values in the column "reactivity" are found by
dividing 1.24×10−24 by the product of the second and third columns. It
indicates the factor by which the other reactions occur more slowly than
the 2
1D-3
1T reaction under comparable conditions. The column "Lawson criterion"
weights these results with Ech and gives an indication of how much more
difficult it is to achieve ignition with these reactions, relative to the
difficulty for the 2
1D-3
1T reaction. The last column is labeled "power density" and weights the
practical reactivity with Efus. It indicates how much lower the fusion
power density of the other reactions is compared to the 2
1D-3
1T reaction and can be considered a measure of the economic potential.

Bremsstrahlung losses in quasineutral, isotropic plasmas

The ions undergoing fusion in many systems will essentially never occur
alone but will be mixed with electrons that in aggregate neutralize the
ions' bulk electrical charge and form a plasma. The electrons will
generally have a temperature comparable to or greater than that of the
ions, so they will collide with the ions and emit x-ray radiation of 10–30
keV energy, a process known as Bremsstrahlung.

The huge size of the Sun and stars means that the x-rays produced in this
process will not escape and will deposit their energy back into the plasma.
They are said to are opaque to x-rays. But any terrestrial fusion reactor
will be optically thin for x-rays of this energy range. X-rays are
difficult to reflect but they are effectively absorbed (and converted into
heat) in less than mm thickness of stainless steel (which is part of a
reactor's shield). This means the bremsstrahlung process is carrying energy
out of the plasma, cooling it.

The ratio of fusion power produced to x-ray radiation lost to walls is an
important figure of merit. This ratio is generally maximized at a much
higher temperature than that which maximizes the power density (see the
previous subsection). The following table shows estimates of the optimum
temperature and the power ratio at that temperature for several
reactions.²⁶

The actual ratios of fusion to Bremsstrahlung power will likely be
significantly lower for several reasons. For one, the calculation assumes
that the energy of the fusion products is transmitted completely to the
fuel ions, which then lose energy to the electrons by collisions, which in
turn lose energy by Bremsstrahlung. However, because the fusion products
move much faster than the fuel ions, they will give up a significant
fraction of their energy directly to the electrons. Secondly, the ions in
the plasma are assumed to be purely fuel ions. In practice, there will be a
significant proportion of impurity ions, which will then lower the ratio.
In particular, the fusion products themselves must remain in the plasma
until they have given up their energy, and will remain some time after that
in any proposed confinement scheme. Finally, all channels of energy loss
other than Bremsstrahlung have been neglected. The last two factors are
related. On theoretical and experimental grounds, particle and energy
confinement seem to be closely related. In a confinement scheme that does a
good job of retaining energy, fusion products will build up. If the fusion
products are efficiently ejected, then energy confinement will be poor,
too.

The temperatures maximizing the fusion power compared to the Bremsstrahlung
are in every case higher than the temperature that maximizes the power
density and minimizes the required value of the fusion triple product. This
will not change the optimum operating point for 2
1D-3
1T very much because the Bremsstrahlung fraction is low, but it will push
the other fuels into regimes where the power density relative to 2
1D-3
1T is even lower and the required confinement even more difficult to
achieve. For 2
1D-2
1D and 2
1D-3
2He, Bremsstrahlung losses will be a serious, possibly prohibitive problem.
For 3
2He-3
2He, p⁺-6
3Li and p⁺-11
5B the Bremsstrahlung losses appear to make a fusion reactor using these
fuels with a quasineutral, isotropic plasma impossible. Some ways out of
this dilemma are considered—and rejected—in Fundamental limitations on
plasma fusion systems not in thermodynamic equilibrium by Todd Rider.²⁸
This limitation does not apply to non-neutral and anisotropic plasmas;
however, these have their own challenges to contend with.

Nucleosynthesis

For the song by Vangelis, see Albedo 0.39.

Nucleosynthesis is the process that creates new atomic nuclei from
pre-existing nucleons, primarily protons and neutrons. The first nuclei
were formed about three minutes after the Big Bang, through the process
called Big Bang nucleosynthesis. It was then that hydrogen and helium
formed to become the content of the first stars, and this primeval process
is responsible for the present hydrogen/helium ratio of the cosmos.

With the formation of stars, heavier nuclei were created from hydrogen and
helium by stellar nucleosynthesis, a process that continues today. Some of
these elements, particularly those lighter than iron, continue to be
delivered to the interstellar medium when low mass stars eject their outer
envelope before they collapse to form white dwarfs. The remains of their
ejected mass form the planetary nebulae observable throughout our galaxy.

Supernova nucleosynthesis within exploding stars by fusing carbon and
oxygen is responsible for the abundances of elements between magnesium
(atomic number 12) and nickel (atomic number 28).¹ Supernova
nucleosynthesis is also thought to be responsible for the creation of rarer
elements heavier than iron and nickel, in the last few seconds of a type II
supernova event. The synthesis of these heavier elements absorbs energy
(endothermic) as they are created, from the energy produced during the
supernova explosion. Some of those elements are created from the absorption
of multiple neutrons (the R process) in the period of a few seconds during
the explosion. The elements formed in supernovas include the heaviest
elements known, such as the long-lived elements uranium and thorium.

Cosmic ray spallation, caused when cosmic rays impact the interstellar
medium and fragment larger atomic species, is a significant source of the
lighter nuclei, particularly ³He, ⁹Be and 10,11B, that are not created by
stellar nucleosynthesis.

In addition to the fusion processes responsible for the growing abundances
of elements in the universe, a few minor natural processes continue to
produce very small numbers of new nuclides on Earth. These nuclides
contribute little to their abundances, but may account for the presence of
specific new nuclei. These nuclides are produced via radiogenesis (decay)
of long-lived, heavy, primordial radionuclides such as uranium and thorium.
Cosmic ray bombardment of elements on Earth also contribute to the presence
of rare, short-lived atomic species called cosmogenic nuclides.

Timeline

It is thought that the primordial nucleons themselves were formed from the
quark–gluon plasma during the Big Bang as it cooled below two trillion
degrees. A few minutes afterward, starting with only protons and neutrons,
nuclei up to lithium and beryllium (both with mass number 7) were formed,
but the abundances of other elements dropped sharply with growing atomic
mass. Some boron may have been formed at this time, but the process stopped
before significant carbon could be formed, as this element requires a far
higher product of helium density and time than were present in the short
nucleosynthesis period of the Big Bang. That fusion process essentially
shut down at about 20 minutes, due to drops in temperature and density as
the universe continued to expand. This first process, Big Bang
nucleosynthesis, was the first type of nucleogenesis to occur in the
universe.

The subsequent nucleosynthesis of the heavier elements requires the extreme
temperatures and pressures found within stars and supernovas. These
processes began as hydrogen and helium from the Big Bang collapsed into the
first stars at 500 million years. Star formation has occurred continuously
in the galaxy since that time. The elements found on Earth, the so-called
primordial elements, were created prior to Earth's formation by stellar
nucleosynthesis and by supernova nucleosynthesis. They range in atomic
numbers from Z=6 (carbon) to Z=94 (plutonium). Synthesis of these elements
occurred either by nuclear fusion (including both rapid and slow multiple
neutron capture) or to a lesser degree by nuclear fission followed by beta
decay.

A star gains heavier elements by combining its lighter nuclei, hydrogen,
deuterium, beryllium, lithium, and boron, which were found in the initial
composition of the interstellar medium and hence the star. Interstellar gas
therefore contains declining abundances of these light elements, which are
present only by virtue of their nucleosynthesis during the Big Bang. Larger
quantities of these lighter elements in the present universe are therefore
thought to have been restored through billions of years of cosmic ray
(mostly high-energy proton) mediated breakup of heavier elements in
interstellar gas and dust. The fragments of these cosmic-ray collisions
include the light elements Li, Be and B.

History of nucleosynthesis theory

The first ideas on nucleosynthesis were simply that the chemical elements
were created at the beginning of the universe, but no rational physical
scenario for this could be identified. Gradually it became clear that
hydrogen and helium are much more abundant than any of the other elements.
All the rest constitute less than 2% of the mass of the Solar System, and
of other star systems as well. At the same time it was clear that oxygen
and carbon were the next two most common elements, and also that there was
a general trend toward high abundance of the light elements, especially
those composed of whole numbers of helium-4 nuclei.

Arthur Stanley Eddington first suggested in 1920, that stars obtain their
energy by fusing hydrogen into helium and raised the possibility that the
heavier elements may also form in stars.² ³ This idea was not generally
accepted, as the nuclear mechanism was not understood. In the years
immediately before World War II, Hans Bethe first elucidated those nuclear
mechanisms by which hydrogen is fused into helium.

Fred Hoyle's original work on nucleosynthesis of heavier elements in stars,
occurred just after World War II.⁴ His work explained the production of all
heavier elements, starting from hydrogen. Hoyle proposed that hydrogen is
continuously created in the universe from vacuum and energy, without need
for universal beginning.

Hoyle's work explained how the abundances of the elements increased with
time as the galaxy aged. Subsequently, Hoyle's picture was expanded during
the 1960s by contributions from William A. Fowler, Alastair G. W. Cameron,
and Donald D. Clayton, followed by many others. In the seminal 1957 review
paper by E. M. Burbidge, G. R. Burbidge, Fowler and Hoyle (see Ref. list)
is a well-known summary of the state of the field in 1957. That paper
defined new processes for the transformation of one heavy nucleus into
others within stars, processes that could be documented by astronomers.

The Big Bang itself had been proposed in 1931, long before this period, by
Georges Lemaître, a Belgian physicist, who suggested that the evident
expansion of the Universe in time required that the Universe, if contracted
backwards in time, would continue to do so until it could contract no
further. This would bring all the mass of the Universe to a single point, a
"primeval atom", to a state before which time and space did not exist.
Hoyle later gave Lemaître's model the derisive term of Big Bang, not
realizing that Lemaître's model was needed to explain the existence of
deuterium and nuclides between helium and carbon, as well as the
fundamentally high amount of helium present, not only in stars but also in
interstellar space. As it happened, both Lemaître and Hoyle's models of
nucleosynthesis would be needed to explain the elemental abundances in the
universe.

The goal of the theory of nucleosynthesis is to explain the vastly
differing abundances of the chemical elements and their several isotopes
from the perspective of natural processes. The primary stimulus to the
development of this theory was the shape of a plot of the abundances versus
the atomic number of the elements. Those abundances, when plotted on a
graph as a function of atomic number, have a jagged sawtooth structure that
varies by factors up to ten million. A very influential stimulus to
nucleosynthesis research was an abundance table created by Hans Suess and
Harold Urey that was based on the unfractionated abundances of the
non-volatile elements found within unevolved meteorites.⁵ Such a graph of
the abundances is displayed on a logarithmic scale below, where the
dramatically jagged structure is visually suppressed by the many powers of
ten spanned in the vertical scale of this graph. See Handbook of Isotopes
in the Cosmos for more data and discussion of abundances of the isotopes.⁶

Processes

There are a number of astrophysical processes which are believed to be
responsible for nucleosynthesis. The majority of these occur in shells
within stars, and the chain of those nuclear fusion processes are known as
hydrogen burning (via the proton-proton chain or the CNO cycle), helium
burning, carbon burning, neon burning, oxygen burning and silicon burning.
These processes are able to create elements up to and including iron and
nickel. This is the region of nucleosynthesis within which the isotopes
with the highest binding energy per nucleon are created. Heavier elements
can be assembled within stars by a neutron capture process known as the
s-process or in explosive environments, such as supernovae, by a number of
other processes. Some of those others include the r-process, which involves
rapid neutron captures, the rp-process, and the p-process (sometimes known
as the gamma process), which results in the photodisintegration of existing
nuclei.

The major types of nucleosynthesis

Big Bang nucleosynthesis

Main article: Big Bang nucleosynthesis

Big Bang nucleosynthesis occurred within the first three minutes of the
beginning of the universe and is responsible for much of the abundance of
¹H (protium), ²H (D, deuterium), ³He (helium-3), and ⁴He (helium-4).
Although ⁴He continues to be produced by stellar fusion and alpha decays
and trace amounts of ¹H continue to be produced by spallation and certain
types of radioactive decay, most of the mass of the isotopes in the
universe are thought to have been produced in the Big Bang. The nuclei of
these elements, along with some ⁷Li and ⁷Be are considered to have been
formed between 100 and 300 seconds after the Big Bang when the primordial
quark–gluon plasma froze out to form protons and neutrons. Because of the
very short period in which nucleosynthesis occurred before it was stopped
by expansion and cooling (about 20 minutes), no elements heavier than
beryllium (or possibly boron) could be formed. Elements formed during this
time were in the plasma state, and did not cool to the state of neutral
atoms until much later.

Stellar nucleosynthesis

Main articles: Stellar nucleosynthesis, Proton-proton chain, Triple-alpha
process, CNO cycle, s-process, p-process and photodisintegration

Stellar nucleosynthesis is the nuclear process by which new nuclei are
produced. It occurs in stars during stellar evolution. It is responsible
for the galactic abundances of elements from carbon to iron. Stars are
thermonuclear furnaces in which H and He are fused into heavier nuclei by
increasingly high temperatures as the composition of the core evolves.⁸ Of
particular importance is carbon, because its formation from He is a
bottleneck in the entire process. Carbon is produced by the triple-alpha
process in all stars. Carbon is also the main element that causes the
release of free neutrons within stars, giving rise to the s-process, in
which the slow absorption of neutrons converts iron into elements heavier
than iron and nickel.⁹

The products of stellar nucleosynthesis are generally dispersed into the
interstellar gas through mass loss episodes and the stellar winds of low
mass stars. The mass loss events can be witnessed today in the planetary
nebulae phase of low-mass star evolution, and the explosive ending of
stars, called supernovae, of those with more than eight times the mass of
the Sun.

The first direct proof that nucleosynthesis occurs in stars was the
astronomical observation that interstellar gas has become enriched with
heavy elements as time passed. As a result, stars that were born from it
late in the galaxy, formed with much higher initial heavy element
abundances than those that had formed earlier. The detection of technetium
in the atmosphere of a red giant star in 1952,¹⁰ by spectroscopy, provided
the first evidence of nuclear activity within stars. Because technetium is
radioactive, with a half-life much less than the age of the star, its
abundance must reflect its recent creation within that star. Equally
convincing evidence of the stellar origin of heavy elements, is the large
overabundances of specific stable elements found in stellar atmospheres of
asymptotic giant branch stars. Observation of barium abundances some 20-50
times greater than found in unevolved stars is evidence of the operation of
the s-process within such stars. Many modern proofs of stellar
nucleosynthesis are provided by the isotopic compositions of stardust,
solid grains that have condensed from the gases of individual stars and
which have been extracted from meteorites. Stardust is one component of
cosmic dust, and is frequently called presolar grains. The measured
isotopic compositions in stardust grains demonstrate many aspects of
nucleosynthesis within the stars from which the grains condensed during the
star's late-life mass-loss episodes.¹¹

Explosive nucleosynthesis

Main articles: r-process, rp-process and Supernova nucleosynthesis

Supernova nucleosynthesis occurs in the energetic environment in
supernovae, in which the elements between silicon and nickel are
synthesized in quasiequilibrium¹² established during fast fusion that
attaches by reciprocating balanced nuclear reactions to ²⁸Si.
Quasiequilibrium can be thought of as almost equilibrium except for a high
abundance of the ²⁸Si nuclei in the feverishly burning mix. This concept¹³
was the most important discovery in nucleosynthesis theory of the
intermediate-mass elements since Hoyle's 1954 paper because it provided an
overarching understanding of the abundant and chemically important elements
between silicon (A=28) and nickel (A=60). It replaced the incorrect
although much cited alpha process of the B2FH paper, which inadvertently
obscured Hoyle's better 1954 theory.¹⁴ Further nucleosynthesis processes
can occur, in particular the r-process (rapid process) described by the
B2FH paper and first calculated by Seeger, Fowler and Clayton,¹⁵ in which
the most neutron-rich isotopes of elements heavier than nickel are produced
by rapid absorption of free neutrons. The creation of free neutrons by
electron capture during the rapid compression of the supernova core along
with assembly of some neutron-rich seed nuclei makes the r-process a
primary process, and one that can occur even in a star of pure H and He.
This is in contrast to the B2FH designation of the process as a secondary
process. This promising scenario, though generally supported by supernova
experts, has yet to achieve a totally satisfactory calculation of r-process
abundances. The primary r-process has been confirmed by astronomers who
have observed old stars born when galactic metallicity was still small,
that nonetheless contain their complement of r-process nuclei; thereby
demonstrating that the metallicity is a product of an internal process. The
r-process is responsible for our natural cohort of radioactive elements,
such as uranium and thorium, as well as the most neutron-rich isotopes of
each heavy element.

The rp-process (rapid proton) involves the rapid absorption of free protons
as well as neutrons, but its role and its existence are less certain.

Explosive nucleosynthesis occurs too rapidly for radioactive decay to
decrease the number of neutrons, so that many abundant isotopes with equal
and even numbers of protons and neutrons are synthesized by the silicon
quasiequilibrium process.¹⁶ During this process, the burning of oxygen and
silicon fuses nuclei that themselves have equal numbers of protons and
neutrons to produce nuclides which consist of whole numbers of helium
nuclei, up to 15 (representing ⁶⁰Ni). Such multiple-alpha-particle nuclides
are totally stable up to ⁴⁰Ca (made of 10 helium nuclei), but heavier
nuclei with equal and even numbers of protons and neutrons are tightly
bound but unstable. The quasiequilibrium produces radioactive isobars ⁴⁴Ti,
⁴⁸Cr, ⁵²Fe, and ⁵⁶Ni, which (except ⁴⁴Ti) are created in abundance but
decay after the explosion and leave the most stable isotope of the
corresponding element at the same atomic weight. The most abundant and
extant isotopes of elements produced in this way are ⁴⁸Ti, ⁵²Cr, and ⁵⁶Fe.
These decays are accompanied by the emission of gamma-rays (radiation from
the nucleus), whose spectroscopic lines can be used to identify the isotope
created by the decay. The detection of these emission lines were an
important early product of gamma-ray astronomy.¹⁷

The most convincing proof of explosive nucleosynthesis in supernovae
occurred in 1987 when those gamma-ray lines were detected emerging from
supernova 1987A. Gamma ray lines identifying ⁵⁶Co and ⁵⁷Co nuclei, whose
radioactive half-lives limit their age to about a year, proved that they
were created by their radioactive cobalt parents. This nuclear astronomy
observation was predicted in 1969¹⁸ as a way to confirm explosive
nucleosynthesis of the elements, and that prediction played an important
role in the planning for NASA's Compton Gamma-Ray Observatory.

Other proofs of explosive nucleosynthesis are found within the stardust
grains that condensed within the interiors of supernovae as they expanded
and cooled. Stardust grains are one component of cosmic dust. In
particular, radioactive ⁴⁴Ti was measured to be very abundant within
supernova stardust grains at the time they condensed during the supernova
expansion.¹⁹ This confirmed a 1975 prediction of the identification of
supernova stardust (SUNOCONs), which became part of the pantheon of
presolar grains. Other unusual isotopic ratios within these grains reveal
many specific aspects of explosive nucleosynthesis.

Cosmic ray spallation

Main article: Cosmic ray spallation

Cosmic ray spallation process reduces the atomic weight of interstellar
matter by the impact with cosmic rays, to produce some of the lightest
elements present in the universe (though not a significant amount of
deuterium). Most notably spallation is believed to be responsible for the
generation of almost all of ³He and the elements lithium, beryllium, and
boron, although some 7Li and 7Be are thought to have been produced in the
Big Bang. The spallation process results from the impact of cosmic rays
(mostly fast protons) against the interstellar medium. These impacts
fragment carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen nuclei present. The process results
in the light elements beryllium, boron, and lithium in cosmos at much
greater abundances than they are within solar atmospheres. The light
elements ¹H and ⁴He nuclei are not a product of spallation and are
represented in the cosmos with approximately primordial abundance.

Beryllium and boron are not significantly produced by stellar fusion
processes, due to the instability of any ⁸Be formed from two ⁴He nuclei.

Empirical evidence

Theories of nucleosynthesis are tested by calculating isotope abundances
and comparing those results with observed results. Isotope abundances are
typically calculated from the transition rates between isotopes in a
network. Often these calculations can be simplified as a few key reactions
control the rate of other reactions.

Minor mechanisms and processes

Very small amounts of certain nuclides are produced on Earth by artificial
means. Those are our primary source, for example, of technetium. However,
some nuclides are also produced by a number of natural means that have
continued after primordial elements were in place. These often act to
produce new elements in ways that can be used to date rocks or to trace the
source of geological processes. Although these processes do not produce the
nuclides in abundance, they are assumed to be the entire source of the
existing natural supply of those nuclides.

These mechanisms include:

- Radioactive decay may lead to radiogenic daughter nuclides. The nuclear
  decay of many long-lived primordial isotopes, especially uranium-235,
  uranium-238, and thorium-232 produce many intermediate daughter nuclides,
  before they too finally decay to isotopes of lead. The Earth's natural
  supply of elements like radon and polonium is via this mechanism. The
  atmosphere's supply of argon-40 is due mostly to the radioactive decay of
  potassium-40 in the time since the formation of the Earth. Little of the
  atmospheric argon is primordial. Helium-4 is produced by alpha-decay, and
  the helium trapped in Earth's crust is also mostly non-primordial. In
  other types of radioactive decay, such as cluster decay, larger species
  of nuclei are ejected (for example, neon-20), and these eventually become
  newly formed stable atoms.
- Radioactive decay may lead to spontaneous fission. This is not cluster
  decay, as the fission products may be split among nearly any type of
  atom. Thorium-232, uranium-235, and uranium-238 are primordial isotopes
  that undergo spontaneous fission. Natural technetium and promethium are
  produced in this manner.
- Nuclear reactions. Naturally-occurring nuclear reactions powered by
  radioactive decay give rise to so-called nucleogenic nuclides. This
  process happens when an energetic particle from a radioactive decay,
  often an alpha particle, reacts with a nucleus of another atom to change
  the nucleus into another nuclide. This process may also cause the
  production of further subatomic particles, such as neutrons. Neutrons can
  also be produced in spontaneous fission and by neutron emission. These
  neutrons can then go on to produce other nuclides via neutron-induced
  fission, or by neutron capture. For example, some stable isotopes such as
  neon-21 and neon-22 are produced by several routes of nucleogenic
  synthesis, and thus only part of their abundance is primordial.
- Nuclear reactions due to cosmic rays. By convention, these
  reaction-products are not termed "nucleogenic" nuclides, but rather
  cosmogenic nuclides. Cosmic rays continue to produce new elements on
  Earth by the same cosmogenic processes discussed above that produce
  primordial beryllium and boron. One important example is carbon-14,
  produced from nitrogen-14 in the atmosphere by cosmic rays. Iodine-129 is
  another example.

In addition to artificial processes, it is postulated that neutron star
collision is the main source of elements heavier than iron.²⁰

Photon

This article is about the elementary particle of light. For other uses, see
Photon (disambiguation).

A photon is an elementary particle, the quantum of light and all other
forms of electromagnetic radiation. It is the force carrier for the
electromagnetic force, even when static via virtual photons. The effects of
this force are easily observable at the microscopic and at the macroscopic
level, because the photon has zero rest mass; this allows long distance
interactions. Like all elementary particles, photons are currently best
explained by quantum mechanics and exhibit wave–particle duality,
exhibiting properties of waves and of particles. For example, a single
photon may be refracted by a lens or exhibit wave interference with itself,
but also act as a particle giving a definite result when its position is
measured. Waves and quanta, being two observable aspects of a single
phenomenon cannot have their true nature described in terms of any
mechanical model. ² A representation of this dual property of light, which
assumes certain points on the wave front to be the seat of the energy is
also impossible. Thus, the quanta in a light wave cannot be spatially
localized. Some defined physical parameters of a photon are listed.

The modern photon concept was developed gradually by Albert Einstein in the
first years of the 20th century to explain experimental observations that
did not fit the classical wave model of light. In particular, the photon
model accounted for the frequency dependence of light's energy, and
explained the ability of matter and radiation to be in thermal equilibrium.
It also accounted for anomalous observations, including the properties of
black-body radiation, that other physicists, most notably Max Planck, had
sought to explain using semiclassical models, in which light is still
described by Maxwell's equations, but the material objects that emit and
absorb light do so in amounts of energy that are quantized (i.e., they
change energy only by certain particular discrete amounts and cannot change
energy in any arbitrary way). Although these semiclassical models
contributed to the development of quantum mechanics, many further
experiments³ ⁴ starting with Compton scattering of single photons by
electrons, first observed in 1923, validated Einstein's hypothesis that
light itself is quantized. In 1926 the optical physicist Frithiof Wolfers
and the chemist Gilbert N. Lewis coined the name photon for these
particles, and after 1927, when Arthur H. Compton won the Nobel Prize for
his scattering studies, most scientists accepted the validity that quanta
of light have an independent existence, and the term photon for light
quanta was accepted.

In the Standard Model of particle physics, photons and other elementary
particles are described as a necessary consequence of physical laws having
a certain symmetry at every point in spacetime. The intrinsic properties of
particles, such as charge, mass and spin, are determined by the properties
of this gauge symmetry. The photon concept has led to momentous advances in
experimental and theoretical physics, such as lasers, Bose–Einstein
condensation, quantum field theory, and the probabilistic interpretation of
quantum mechanics. It has been applied to photochemistry, high-resolution
microscopy, and measurements of molecular distances. Recently, photons have
been studied as elements of quantum computers and for applications in
optical imaging and optical communication such as quantum cryptography.

Nomenclature

In 1900, the German physicist Max Planck was working on black-body
radiation and suggested that the energy in electromagnetic waves could only
be released in "packets" of energy. In his 1901 article ⁵ in Annalen der
Physik he called these packets "energy elements". The word quanta (singular
quantum) was used even before 1900 to mean particles or amounts of
different quantities, including electricity. Later, in 1905, Albert
Einstein went further by suggesting that electromagnetic waves could only
exist in these discrete wave-packets.⁶ He called such a wave-packet the
light quantum (German: das Lichtquant).[Note 1] The name photon derives
from the Greek word for light, φῶς (transliterated phôs). Arthur Compton
used photon in 1928, referring to Gilbert N. Lewis.⁷ The same name was used
earlier, by the American physicist and psychologist Leonard T. Troland, who
coined the word in 1916, in 1921 by the Irish physicist John Joly, in 1924
by the French physiologist René Wurmser (1890-1993) and in 1926 by the
French physicist Frithiof Wolfers (1891-1971).⁸ The name was suggested
initially as a unit related to the illumination of the eye and the
resulting sensation of light and was used later on in a physiological
context. Although Wolfers's and Lewis's theories were never accepted, as
they were contradicted by many experiments, the new name was adopted very
soon by most physicists after Compton used it.⁸ [Note 2]

In physics, a photon is usually denoted by the symbol γ (the Greek letter
gamma). This symbol for the photon probably derives from gamma rays, which
were discovered in 1900 by Paul Villard,⁹ ¹⁰ named by Ernest Rutherford in
1903, and shown to be a form of electromagnetic radiation in 1914 by
Rutherford and Edward Andrade.¹¹ In chemistry and optical engineering,
photons are usually symbolized by hν, the energy of a photon, where h is
Planck's constant and the Greek letter ν (nu) is the photon's frequency.
Much less commonly, the photon can be symbolized by hf, where its frequency
is denoted by f.

Physical properties

See also: Special relativity and Photonic molecule

A photon is massless,[Note 3] has no electric charge,¹² and is stable. A
photon has two possible polarization states. In the momentum
representation, which is preferred in quantum field theory, a photon is
described by its wave vector, which determines its wavelength λ and its
direction of propagation. A photon's wave vector may not be zero and can be
represented either as a spatial 3-vector or as a (relativistic)
four-vector; in the latter case it belongs to the light cone (pictured).
Different signs of the four-vector denote different circular polarizations,
but in the 3-vector representation one should account for the polarization
state separately; it actually is a spin quantum number. In both cases the
space of possible wave vectors is three-dimensional.

The photon is the gauge boson for electromagnetism,¹³ :29-30 and therefore
all other quantum numbers of the photon (such as lepton number, baryon
number, and flavour quantum numbers) are zero.¹⁴ Also, the photon does not
obey the Pauli exclusion principle.¹⁵ :1221

Photons are emitted in many natural processes. For example, when a charge
is accelerated it emits synchrotron radiation. During a molecular, atomic
or nuclear transition to a lower energy level, photons of various energy
will be emitted, from radio waves to gamma rays. A photon can also be
emitted when a particle and its corresponding antiparticle are annihilated
(for example, electron–positron annihilation).¹⁵ :572, 1114, 1172

In empty space, the photon moves at c (the speed of light) and its energy
and momentum are related by E = pc, where p is the magnitude of the
momentum vector p. This derives from the following relativistic relation,
with m = 0:¹⁶

E^{2}=p^{2} c^{2} + m^{2} c^{4}.

The energy and momentum of a photon depend only on its frequency (ν) or
inversely, its wavelength (λ):

E=\hbar ω=hν=\frac{hc}{λ}
\boldsymbol{p} =\hbar \boldsymbol{k} ,

where k is the wave vector (where the wave number k = |k| = 2π/λ), ω = 2πν
is the angular frequency, and ħ = h/2π is the reduced Planck constant.¹⁷

Since p points in the direction of the photon's propagation, the magnitude
of the momentum is

p=\hbar k=\frac{hν}{c} =\frac{h}{λ} .

The photon also carries spin angular momentum that does not depend on its
frequency.¹⁸ The magnitude of its spin is √(2) \hbar and the component
measured along its direction of motion, its helicity, must be ±ħ. These two
possible helicities, called right-handed and left-handed, correspond to the
two possible circular polarization states of the photon.¹⁹

To illustrate the significance of these formulae, the annihilation of a
particle with its antiparticle in free space must result in the creation of
at least two photons for the following reason. In the center of momentum
frame, the colliding antiparticles have no net momentum, whereas a single
photon always has momentum (since, as we have seen, it is determined by the
photon's frequency or wavelength, which cannot be zero). Hence,
conservation of momentum (or equivalently, translational invariance)
requires that at least two photons are created, with zero net momentum.
(However, it is possible if the system interacts with another particle or
field for annihilation to produce one photon, as when a positron
annihilates with a bound atomic electron, it is possible for only one
photon to be emitted, as the nuclear Coulomb field breaks translational
symmetry.)²⁰ :64-65 The energy of the two photons, or, equivalently, their
frequency, may be determined from conservation of four-momentum. Seen
another way, the photon can be considered as its own antiparticle. The
reverse process, pair production, is the dominant mechanism by which
high-energy photons such as gamma rays lose energy while passing through
matter.²¹ That process is the reverse of "annihilation to one photon"
allowed in the electric field of an atomic nucleus.

The classical formulae for the energy and momentum of electromagnetic
radiation can be re-expressed in terms of photon events. For example, the
pressure of electromagnetic radiation on an object derives from the
transfer of photon momentum per unit time and unit area to that object,
since pressure is force per unit area and force is the change in momentum
per unit time.²²

Experimental checks on photon mass

Current commonly accepted physical theories imply or assume the photon to
be strictly massless. If the photon is not a strictly massless particle, it
would not move at the exact speed of light in vacuum, c. Its speed would be
lower and depend on its frequency. Relativity would be unaffected by this;
the so-called speed of light, c, would then not be the actual speed at
which light moves, but a constant of nature which is the maximum speed that
any object could theoretically attain in space-time.²³ Thus, it would still
be the speed of space-time ripples (gravitational waves and gravitons), but
it would not be the speed of photons.

If a photon did have non-zero mass, there would be other effects as well.
Coulomb's law would be modified and the electromagnetic field would have an
extra physical degree of freedom. These effects yield more sensitive
experimental probes of the photon mass than the frequency dependence of the
speed of light. If Coulomb's law is not exactly valid, then that would
cause the presence of an electric field inside a hollow conductor when it
is subjected to an external electric field. This thus allows one to test
Coulomb's law to very high precision.²⁴ A null result of such an experiment
has set a limit of m ≲ 10−14 eV/c².²⁵

Sharper upper limits have been obtained in experiments designed to detect
effects caused by the galactic vector potential. Although the galactic
vector potential is very large because the galactic magnetic field exists
on very long length scales, only the magnetic field is observable if the
photon is massless. In case of a massive photon, the mass term \frac{1}{2}
m^2 A_{μ}A^{μ} would affect the galactic plasma. The fact that no such
effects are seen implies an upper bound on the photon mass of m < 3×10−27
eV/c².²⁶ The galactic vector potential can also be probed directly by
measuring the torque exerted on a magnetized ring.²⁷ Such methods were used
to obtain the sharper upper limit of 10−18eV/c² (the equivalent of
1.07×10−27 atomic mass units) given by the Particle Data Group.²⁸

These sharp limits from the non-observation of the effects caused by the
galactic vector potential have been shown to be model dependent.²⁹ If the
photon mass is generated via the Higgs mechanism then the upper limit of
m≲10−14 eV/c² from the test of Coulomb's law is valid.

Photons inside superconductors do develop a nonzero effective rest mass; as
a result, electromagnetic forces become short-range inside
superconductors.³⁰

Historical development

Main article: Light

In most theories up to the eighteenth century, light was pictured as being
made up of particles. Since particle models cannot easily account for the
refraction, diffraction and birefringence of light, wave theories of light
were proposed by René Descartes (1637),³¹ Robert Hooke (1665),³² and
Christiaan Huygens (1678);³³ however, particle models remained dominant,
chiefly due to the influence of Isaac Newton.³⁴ In the early nineteenth
century, Thomas Young and August Fresnel clearly demonstrated the
interference and diffraction of light and by 1850 wave models were
generally accepted.³⁵ In 1865, James Clerk Maxwell's prediction³⁶ that
light was an electromagnetic wave—which was confirmed experimentally in
1888 by Heinrich Hertz's detection of radio waves³⁷ —seemed to be the final
blow to particle models of light.

The Maxwell wave theory, however, does not account for all properties of
light. The Maxwell theory predicts that the energy of a light wave depends
only on its intensity, not on its frequency; nevertheless, several
independent types of experiments show that the energy imparted by light to
atoms depends only on the light's frequency, not on its intensity. For
example, some chemical reactions are provoked only by light of frequency
higher than a certain threshold; light of frequency lower than the
threshold, no matter how intense, does not initiate the reaction.
Similarly, electrons can be ejected from a metal plate by shining light of
sufficiently high frequency on it (the photoelectric effect); the energy of
the ejected electron is related only to the light's frequency, not to its
intensity.³⁸ [Note 4]

At the same time, investigations of blackbody radiation carried out over
four decades (1860–1900) by various researchers³⁹ culminated in Max
Planck's hypothesis⁵ ⁴⁰ that the energy of any system that absorbs or emits
electromagnetic radiation of frequency ν is an integer multiple of an
energy quantum E = hν. As shown by Albert Einstein,⁶ ⁴¹ some form of energy
quantization must be assumed to account for the thermal equilibrium
observed between matter and electromagnetic radiation; for this explanation
of the photoelectric effect, Einstein received the 1921 Nobel Prize in
physics.⁴²

Since the Maxwell theory of light allows for all possible energies of
electromagnetic radiation, most physicists assumed initially that the
energy quantization resulted from some unknown constraint on the matter
that absorbs or emits the radiation. In 1905, Einstein was the first to
propose that energy quantization was a property of electromagnetic
radiation itself.⁶ Although he accepted the validity of Maxwell's theory,
Einstein pointed out that many anomalous experiments could be explained if
the energy of a Maxwellian light wave were localized into point-like quanta
that move independently of one another, even if the wave itself is spread
continuously over space.⁶ In 1909⁴¹ and 1916,⁴³ Einstein showed that, if
Planck's law of black-body radiation is accepted, the energy quanta must
also carry momentum p = h/λ, making them full-fledged particles. This
photon momentum was observed experimentally⁴⁴ by Arthur Compton, for which
he received the Nobel Prize in 1927. The pivotal question was then: how to
unify Maxwell's wave theory of light with its experimentally observed
particle nature? The answer to this question occupied Albert Einstein for
the rest of his life,⁴⁵ and was solved in quantum electrodynamics and its
successor, the Standard Model (see Second quantization and The photon as a
gauge boson, below).

Einstein's light quantum

Unlike Planck, Einstein entertained the possibility that there might be
actual physical quanta of light—what we now call photons. He noticed that a
light quantum with energy proportional to its frequency would explain a
number of troubling puzzles and paradoxes, including an unpublished law by
Stokes, the ultraviolet catastrophe, and of course the photoelectric
effect. Stokes's law said simply that the frequency of fluorescent light
cannot be greater than the frequency of the light (usually ultraviolet)
inducing it. Einstein eliminated the ultraviolet catastrophe by imagining a
gas of photons behaving like a gas of electrons that he had previously
considered. He was advised by a colleague to be careful how he wrote up
this paper, in order to not challenge Planck too directly, as he was a
powerful figure, and indeed the warning was justified, as Planck never
forgave him for writing it.⁴⁶

Early objections

Einstein's 1905 predictions were verified experimentally in several ways in
the first two decades of the 20th century, as recounted in Robert
Millikan's Nobel lecture.⁴⁷ However, before Compton's experiment⁴⁴ showing
that photons carried momentum proportional to their wave number (or
frequency) (1922), most physicists were reluctant to believe that
electromagnetic radiation itself might be particulate. (See, for example,
the Nobel lectures of Wien,³⁹ Planck⁴⁰ and Millikan.⁴⁷ ) Instead, there was
a widespread belief that energy quantization resulted from some unknown
constraint on the matter that absorbs or emits radiation. Attitudes changed
over time. In part, the change can be traced to experiments such as Compton
scattering, where it was much more difficult not to ascribe quantization to
light itself to explain the observed results.⁴⁸

Even after Compton's experiment, Niels Bohr, Hendrik Kramers and John
Slater made one last attempt to preserve the Maxwellian continuous
electromagnetic field model of light, the so-called BKS model.⁴⁹ To account
for the data then available, two drastic hypotheses had to be made:

- Energy and momentum are conserved only on the average in interactions
  between matter and radiation, not in elementary processes such as
  absorption and emission. This allows one to reconcile the discontinuously
  changing energy of the atom (jump between energy states) with the
  continuous release of energy into radiation.
- Causality is abandoned. For example, spontaneous emissions are merely
  emissions induced by a "virtual" electromagnetic field.

However, refined Compton experiments showed that energy–momentum is
conserved extraordinarily well in elementary processes; and also that the
jolting of the electron and the generation of a new photon in Compton
scattering obey causality to within 10 ps. Accordingly, Bohr and his
co-workers gave their model "as honorable a funeral as possible".⁴⁵
Nevertheless, the failures of the BKS model inspired Werner Heisenberg in
his development of matrix mechanics.⁵⁰

A few physicists persisted⁵¹ in developing semiclassical models in which
electromagnetic radiation is not quantized, but matter appears to obey the
laws of quantum mechanics. Although the evidence for photons from chemical
and physical experiments was overwhelming by the 1970s, this evidence could
not be considered as absolutely definitive; since it relied on the
interaction of light with matter, a sufficiently complicated theory of
matter could in principle account for the evidence. Nevertheless, all
semiclassical theories were refuted definitively in the 1970s and 1980s by
photon-correlation experiments.[Note 5] Hence, Einstein's hypothesis that
quantization is a property of light itself is considered to be proven.

Wave–particle duality and uncertainty principles

See also: Wave–particle duality, Squeezed coherent state, Uncertainty
principle and De Broglie–Bohm theory

Photons, like all quantum objects, exhibit wave-like and particle-like
properties. Their dual wave–particle nature can be difficult to visualize.
The photon displays clearly wave-like phenomena such as diffraction and
interference on the length scale of its wavelength. For example, a single
photon passing through a double-slit experiment lands on the screen
exhibiting interference phenomena but only if no measure was made on the
actual slit being run across. To account for the particle interpretation
that phenomenon is called probability distribution but behaves according to
Maxwell's equations.⁵² However, experiments confirm that the photon is not
a short pulse of electromagnetic radiation; it does not spread out as it
propagates, nor does it divide when it encounters a beam splitter.⁵³
Rather, the photon seems to be a point-like particle since it is absorbed
or emitted as a whole by arbitrarily small systems, systems much smaller
than its wavelength, such as an atomic nucleus (≈10−15 m across) or even
the point-like electron. Nevertheless, the photon is not a point-like
particle whose trajectory is shaped probabilistically by the
electromagnetic field, as conceived by Einstein and others; that hypothesis
was also refuted by the photon-correlation experiments cited above.
According to our present understanding, the electromagnetic field itself is
produced by photons, which in turn result from a local gauge symmetry and
the laws of quantum field theory (see the Second quantization and Gauge
boson sections below).

A key element of quantum mechanics is Heisenberg's uncertainty principle,
which forbids the simultaneous measurement of the position and momentum of
a particle along the same direction. Remarkably, the uncertainty principle
for charged, material particles requires the quantization of light into
photons, and even the frequency dependence of the photon's energy and
momentum. An elegant illustration is Heisenberg's thought experiment for
locating an electron with an ideal microscope.⁵⁴ The position of the
electron can be determined to within the resolving power of the microscope,
which is given by a formula from classical optics

Δx \sim \frac{λ}{\sin θ}

where θ is the aperture angle of the microscope. Thus, the position
uncertainty Δx can be made arbitrarily small by reducing the wavelength λ.
The momentum of the electron is uncertain, since it received a "kick" Δp
from the light scattering from it into the microscope. If light were not
quantized into photons, the uncertainty Δp could be made arbitrarily small
by reducing the light's intensity. In that case, since the wavelength and
intensity of light can be varied independently, one could simultaneously
determine the position and momentum to arbitrarily high accuracy, violating
the uncertainty principle. By contrast, Einstein's formula for photon
momentum preserves the uncertainty principle; since the photon is scattered
anywhere within the aperture, the uncertainty of momentum transferred
equals

Δp \sim p_{photon} \sin θ=\frac{h}{λ} \sin θ

giving the product Δx Δp \sim h, which is Heisenberg's uncertainty
principle. Thus, the entire world is quantized; both matter and fields must
obey a consistent set of quantum laws, if either one is to be quantized.⁵⁵

The analogous uncertainty principle for photons forbids the simultaneous
measurement of the number n of photons (see Fock state and the Second
quantization section below) in an electromagnetic wave and the phase ϕ of
that wave

Δn Δϕ> 1

See coherent state and squeezed coherent state for more details.

Both (photons and material) particles such as electrons create analogous
interference patterns when passing through a double-slit experiment. For
photons, this corresponds to the interference of a Maxwell light wave
whereas, for material particles, this corresponds to the interference of
the Schrödinger wave equation. Although this similarity might suggest that
Maxwell's equations are simply Schrödinger's equation for photons, most
physicists do not agree.⁵⁶ ⁵⁷ For one thing, they are mathematically
different; most obviously, Schrödinger's one equation solves for a complex
field, whereas Maxwell's four equations solve for real fields. More
generally, the normal concept of a Schrödinger probability wave function
cannot be applied to photons.⁵⁸ Being massless, they cannot be localized
without being destroyed; technically, photons cannot have a position
eigenstate |r \rangle , and, thus, the normal Heisenberg uncertainty
principle Δx Δp > h/2 does not pertain to photons. A few substitute wave
functions have been suggested for the photon,⁵⁹ ⁶⁰ ⁶¹ ⁶² but they have not
come into general use. Instead, physicists generally accept the
second-quantized theory of photons described below, quantum
electrodynamics, in which photons are quantized excitations of
electromagnetic modes.

Another interpretation, that avoids duality, is the De Broglie–Bohm theory:
known also as the pilot-wave model, the photon in this theory is both, wave
and particle.⁶³ "This idea seems to me so natural and simple, to resolve
the wave-particle dilemma in such a clear and ordinary way, that it is a
great mystery to me that it was so generally ignored",⁶⁴ J.S.Bell.

Bose–Einstein model of a photon gas

Main articles: Bose gas, Bose–Einstein statistics, Spin-statistics theorem
and Gas in a box

In 1924, Satyendra Nath Bose derived Planck's law of black-body radiation
without using any electromagnetism, but rather a modification of
coarse-grained counting of phase space.⁶⁵ Einstein showed that this
modification is equivalent to assuming that photons are rigorously
identical and that it implied a "mysterious non-local interaction",⁶⁶ ⁶⁷
now understood as the requirement for a symmetric quantum mechanical state.
This work led to the concept of coherent states and the development of the
laser. In the same papers, Einstein extended Bose's formalism to material
particles (bosons) and predicted that they would condense into their lowest
quantum state at low enough temperatures; this Bose–Einstein condensation
was observed experimentally in 1995.⁶⁸ It was later used by Lene Hau to
slow, and then completely stop, light in 1999⁶⁹ and 2001.⁷⁰

The modern view on this is that photons are, by virtue of their integer
spin, bosons (as opposed to fermions with half-integer spin). By the
spin-statistics theorem, all bosons obey Bose–Einstein statistics (whereas
all fermions obey Fermi–Dirac statistics).⁷¹

Stimulated and spontaneous emission

Main articles: Stimulated emission and Laser

In 1916, Einstein showed that Planck's radiation law could be derived from
a semi-classical, statistical treatment of photons and atoms, which implies
a relation between the rates at which atoms emit and absorb photons. The
condition follows from the assumption that light is emitted and absorbed by
atoms independently, and that the thermal equilibrium is preserved by
interaction with atoms. Consider a cavity in thermal equilibrium and filled
with electromagnetic radiation and atoms that can emit and absorb that
radiation. Thermal equilibrium requires that the energy density ρ(ν) of
photons with frequency ν (which is proportional to their number density)
is, on average, constant in time; hence, the rate at which photons of any
particular frequency are emitted must equal the rate of absorbing them.⁷²

Einstein began by postulating simple proportionality relations for the
different reaction rates involved. In his model, the rate R_{ji} for a
system to absorb a photon of frequency ν and transition from a lower energy
E_{j} to a higher energy E_{i} is proportional to the number N_{j} of atoms
with energy E_{j} and to the energy density ρ(ν) of ambient photons with
that frequency,

R_{ji}=N_{j} B_{ji} ρ(ν)

where B_{ji} is the rate constant for absorption. For the reverse process,
there are two possibilities: spontaneous emission of a photon, and a return
to the lower-energy state that is initiated by the interaction with a
passing photon. Following Einstein's approach, the corresponding rate
R_{ij} for the emission of photons of frequency ν and transition from a
higher energy E_{i} to a lower energy E_{j} is

R_{ij}=N_{i} A_{ij} + N_{i} B_{ij} ρ(ν)

where A_{ij} is the rate constant for emitting a photon spontaneously, and
B_{ij} is the rate constant for emitting it in response to ambient photons
(induced or stimulated emission). In thermodynamic equilibrium, the number
of atoms in state i and that of atoms in state j must, on average, be
constant; hence, the rates R_{ji} and R_{ij} must be equal. Also, by
arguments analogous to the derivation of Boltzmann statistics, the ratio of
N_{i} and N_{j} is g_i/g_j\exp{(E_j-E_i)/kT)} , where g_{i,j} are the
degeneracy of the state i and that of j, respectively, E_{i,j} their
energies, k the Boltzmann constant and T the system's temperature. From
this, it is readily derived thatg_iB_{ij}=g_jB_{ji} and

A_{ij}=\frac{8 πh ν^{3}}{c^{3}} B_{ij}.

The A and Bs are collectively known as the Einstein coefficients.⁷³

Einstein could not fully justify his rate equations, but claimed that it
should be possible to calculate the coefficients A_{ij}, B_{ji} and B_{ij}
once physicists had obtained "mechanics and electrodynamics modified to
accommodate the quantum hypothesis".⁷⁴ In fact, in 1926, Paul Dirac derived
the B_{ij} rate constants in using a semiclassical approach,⁷⁵ and, in
1927, succeeded in deriving all the rate constants from first principles
within the framework of quantum theory.⁷⁶ ⁷⁷ Dirac's work was the
foundation of quantum electrodynamics, i.e., the quantization of the
electromagnetic field itself. Dirac's approach is also called second
quantization or quantum field theory;⁷⁸ ⁷⁹ ⁸⁰ earlier quantum mechanical
treatments only treat material particles as quantum mechanical, not the
electromagnetic field.

Einstein was troubled by the fact that his theory seemed incomplete, since
it did not determine the direction of a spontaneously emitted photon. A
probabilistic nature of light-particle motion was first considered by
Newton in his treatment of birefringence and, more generally, of the
splitting of light beams at interfaces into a transmitted beam and a
reflected beam. Newton hypothesized that hidden variables in the light
particle determined which path it would follow.³⁴ Similarly, Einstein hoped
for a more complete theory that would leave nothing to chance, beginning
his separation⁴⁵ from quantum mechanics. Ironically, Max Born's
probabilistic interpretation of the wave function⁸¹ ⁸² was inspired by
Einstein's later work searching for a more complete theory.⁸³

Second quantization and high energy photon interactions

Main article: Quantum field theory

In 1910, Peter Debye derived Planck's law of black-body radiation from a
relatively simple assumption.⁸⁴ He correctly decomposed the electromagnetic
field in a cavity into its Fourier modes, and assumed that the energy in
any mode was an integer multiple of hν, where ν is the frequency of the
electromagnetic mode. Planck's law of black-body radiation follows
immediately as a geometric sum. However, Debye's approach failed to give
the correct formula for the energy fluctuations of blackbody radiation,
which were derived by Einstein in 1909.⁴¹

In 1925, Born, Heisenberg and Jordan reinterpreted Debye's concept in a key
way.⁸⁵ As may be shown classically, the Fourier modes of the
electromagnetic field—a complete set of electromagnetic plane waves indexed
by their wave vector k and polarization state—are equivalent to a set of
uncoupled simple harmonic oscillators. Treated quantum mechanically, the
energy levels of such oscillators are known to be E=nhν, where ν is the
oscillator frequency. The key new step was to identify an electromagnetic
mode with energy E=nhν as a state with n photons, each of energy hν. This
approach gives the correct energy fluctuation formula.

Dirac took this one step further.⁷⁶ ⁷⁷ He treated the interaction between a
charge and an electromagnetic field as a small perturbation that induces
transitions in the photon states, changing the numbers of photons in the
modes, while conserving energy and momentum overall. Dirac was able to
derive Einstein's A_{ij} and B_{ij} coefficients from first principles, and
showed that the Bose–Einstein statistics of photons is a natural
consequence of quantizing the electromagnetic field correctly (Bose's
reasoning went in the opposite direction; he derived Planck's law of
black-body radiation by assuming B–E statistics). In Dirac's time, it was
not yet known that all bosons, including photons, must obey Bose–Einstein
statistics.

Dirac's second-order perturbation theory can involve virtual photons,
transient intermediate states of the electromagnetic field; the static
electric and magnetic interactions are mediated by such virtual photons. In
such quantum field theories, the probability amplitude of observable events
is calculated by summing over all possible intermediate steps, even ones
that are unphysical; hence, virtual photons are not constrained to satisfy
E=pc, and may have extra polarization states; depending on the gauge used,
virtual photons may have three or four polarization states, instead of the
two states of real photons. Although these transient virtual photons can
never be observed, they contribute measurably to the probabilities of
observable events. Indeed, such second-order and higher-order perturbation
calculations can give apparently infinite contributions to the sum. Such
unphysical results are corrected for using the technique of
renormalization.

Other virtual particles may contribute to the summation as well; for
example, two photons may interact indirectly through virtual
electron–positron pairs.⁸⁶ In fact, such photon-photon scattering (see
two-photon physics), as well as electron-photon scattering, is meant to be
one of the modes of operations of the planned particle accelerator, the
International Linear Collider.⁸⁷

In modern physics notation, the quantum state of the electromagnetic field
is written as a Fock state, a tensor product of the states for each
electromagnetic mode

|n_{k_0}\rangle \otimes |n_{k_1}\rangle \otimes …\otimes |n_{k_n}\rangle …

where |n_{k_i}\rangle represents the state in which n_{k_i} photons are in
the mode k_i. In this notation, the creation of a new photon in mode k_i
(e.g., emitted from an atomic transition) is written as |n_{k_i}\rangle
→|n_{k_i}+1\rangle . This notation merely expresses the concept of Born,
Heisenberg and Jordan described above, and does not add any physics.

The hadronic properties of the photon

Measurements of the interaction between energetic photons and hadrons show
that the interaction is much more intense than expected by the interaction
of merely photons with the hadron's electric charge. Furthermore, the
interaction of energetic photons with protons is similar to the interaction
of photons with neutrons⁸⁸ in spite of the fact that the electric charge
structures of protons and neutrons are substantially different.

A theory called Vector Meson Dominance (VMD) was developed to explain this
effect. According to VMD, the photon is a superposition of the pure
electromagnetic photon (which interacts only with electric charges) and
vector meson.⁸⁹

However, if experimentally probed at very short distances, the intrinsic
structure of the photon is recognized as a flux of quark and gluon
components, quasi-free according to asymptotic freedom in QCD and described
by the photon structure function.⁹⁰ ⁹¹ A comprehensive comparison of data
with theoretical predictions is presented in a recent review.⁹²

The photon as a gauge boson

Main article: Gauge theory

The electromagnetic field can be understood as a gauge field, i.e., as a
field that results from requiring that a gauge symmetry holds independently
at every position in spacetime.⁹³ For the electromagnetic field, this gauge
symmetry is the Abelian U(1) symmetry of complex numbers of absolute value
1, which reflects the ability to vary the phase of a complex number without
affecting observables or real valued functions made from it, such as the
energy or the Lagrangian.

The quanta of an Abelian gauge field must be massless, uncharged bosons, as
long as the symmetry is not broken; hence, the photon is predicted to be
massless, and to have zero electric charge and integer spin. The particular
form of the electromagnetic interaction specifies that the photon must have
spin ±1; thus, its helicity must be \pm \hbar . These two spin components
correspond to the classical concepts of right-handed and left-handed
circularly polarized light. However, the transient virtual photons of
quantum electrodynamics may also adopt unphysical polarization states.⁹³

In the prevailing Standard Model of physics, the photon is one of four
gauge bosons in the electroweak interaction; the other three are denoted
W⁺, W− and Z⁰ and are responsible for the weak interaction. Unlike the
photon, these gauge bosons have mass, owing to a mechanism that breaks
their SU(2) gauge symmetry. The unification of the photon with W and Z
gauge bosons in the electroweak interaction was accomplished by Sheldon
Glashow, Abdus Salam and Steven Weinberg, for which they were awarded the
1979 Nobel Prize in physics.⁹⁴ ⁹⁵ ⁹⁶ Physicists continue to hypothesize
grand unified theories that connect these four gauge bosons with the eight
gluon gauge bosons of quantum chromodynamics; however, key predictions of
these theories, such as proton decay, have not been observed
experimentally.⁹⁷

Contributions to the mass of a system

See also: Mass in special relativity and General relativity

The energy of a system that emits a photon is decreased by the energy E of
the photon as measured in the rest frame of the emitting system, which may
result in a reduction in mass in the amount {E}/{c²}. Similarly, the mass
of a system that absorbs a photon is increased by a corresponding amount.
As an application, the energy balance of nuclear reactions involving
photons is commonly written in terms of the masses of the nuclei involved,
and terms of the form {E}/{c²} for the gamma photons (and for other
relevant energies, such as the recoil energy of nuclei).⁹⁸

This concept is applied in key predictions of quantum electrodynamics (QED,
see above). In that theory, the mass of electrons (or, more generally,
leptons) is modified by including the mass contributions of virtual
photons, in a technique known as renormalization. Such "radiative
corrections" contribute to a number of predictions of QED, such as the
magnetic dipole moment of leptons, the Lamb shift, and the hyperfine
structure of bound lepton pairs, such as muonium and positronium.⁹⁹

Since photons contribute to the stress–energy tensor, they exert a
gravitational attraction on other objects, according to the theory of
general relativity. Conversely, photons are themselves affected by gravity;
their normally straight trajectories may be bent by warped spacetime, as in
gravitational lensing, and their frequencies may be lowered by moving to a
higher gravitational potential, as in the Pound–Rebka experiment. However,
these effects are not specific to photons; exactly the same effects would
be predicted for classical electromagnetic waves.¹⁰⁰

Photons in matter

See also: Group velocity and Photochemistry

Any 'explanation' of how photons travel through matter has to explain why
different arrangements of matter are transparent or opaque at different
wavelengths (light through carbon as diamond or not, as graphite) and why
individual photons behave in the same way as large groups. Explanations
that invoke 'absorption' and 're-emission' have to provide an explanation
for the directionality of the photons (diffraction, reflection) and further
explain how entangled photon pairs can travel through matter without their
quantum state collapsing.

The simplest explanation is that light that travels through transparent
matter does so at a lower speed than c, the speed of light in a vacuum. In
addition, light can also undergo scattering and absorption. There are
circumstances in which heat transfer through a material is mostly
radiative, involving emission and absorption of photons within it. An
example would be in the core of the Sun. Energy can take about a million
years to reach the surface.¹⁰¹ However, this phenomenon is distinct from
scattered radiation passing diffusely through matter, as it involves local
equilibrium between the radiation and the temperature. Thus, the time is
how long it takes the energy to be transferred, not the photons themselves.
Once in open space, a photon from the Sun takes only 8.3 minutes to reach
Earth. The factor by which the speed of light is decreased in a material is
called the refractive index of the material. In a classical wave picture,
the slowing can be explained by the light inducing electric polarization in
the matter, the polarized matter radiating new light, and the new light
interfering with the original light wave to form a delayed wave. In a
particle picture, the slowing can instead be described as a blending of the
photon with quantum excitation of the matter (quasi-particles such as
phonons and excitons) to form a polariton; this polariton has a nonzero
effective mass, which means that it cannot travel at c.

Alternatively, photons may be viewed as always traveling at c, even in
matter, but they have their phase shifted (delayed or advanced) upon
interaction with atomic scatters: this modifies their wavelength and
momentum, but not speed.¹⁰² A light wave made up of these photons does
travel slower than the speed of light. In this view the photons are "bare",
and are scattered and phase shifted, while in the view of the preceding
paragraph the photons are "dressed" by their interaction with matter, and
move without scattering or phase shifting, but at a lower speed.

Light of different frequencies may travel through matter at different
speeds; this is called dispersion. In some cases, it can result in
extremely slow speeds of light in matter. The effects of photon
interactions with other quasi-particles may be observed directly in Raman
scattering and Brillouin scattering.¹⁰³

Photons can also be absorbed by nuclei, atoms or molecules, provoking
transitions between their energy levels. A classic example is the molecular
transition of retinal C₂₀H₂₈O, which is responsible for vision, as
discovered in 1958 by Nobel laureate biochemist George Wald and co-workers.
The absorption provokes a cis-trans isomerization that, in combination with
other such transitions, is transduced into nerve impulses. The absorption
of photons can even break chemical bonds, as in the photodissociation of
chlorine; this is the subject of photochemistry.¹⁰⁴ ¹⁰⁵ Analogously, gamma
rays can in some circumstances dissociate atomic nuclei in a process called
photodisintegration.

Technological applications

Photons have many applications in technology. These examples are chosen to
illustrate applications of photons per se, rather than general optical
devices such as lenses, etc. that could operate under a classical theory of
light. The laser is an extremely important application and is discussed
above under stimulated emission.

Individual photons can be detected by several methods. The classic
photomultiplier tube exploits the photoelectric effect: a photon landing on
a metal plate ejects an electron, initiating an ever-amplifying avalanche
of electrons. Charge-coupled device chips use a similar effect in
semiconductors: an incident photon generates a charge on a microscopic
capacitor that can be detected. Other detectors such as Geiger counters use
the ability of photons to ionize gas molecules, causing a detectable change
in conductivity.¹⁰⁶

Planck's energy formula E=hν is often used by engineers and chemists in
design, both to compute the change in energy resulting from a photon
absorption and to predict the frequency of the light emitted for a given
energy transition. For example, the emission spectrum of a fluorescent
light bulb can be designed using gas molecules with different electronic
energy levels and adjusting the typical energy with which an electron hits
the gas molecules within the bulb.[Note 6]

Under some conditions, an energy transition can be excited by "two" photons
that individually would be insufficient. This allows for higher resolution
microscopy, because the sample absorbs energy only in the region where two
beams of different colors overlap significantly, which can be made much
smaller than the excitation volume of a single beam (see two-photon
excitation microscopy). Moreover, these photons cause less damage to the
sample, since they are of lower energy.¹⁰⁷

In some cases, two energy transitions can be coupled so that, as one system
absorbs a photon, another nearby system "steals" its energy and re-emits a
photon of a different frequency. This is the basis of fluorescence
resonance energy transfer, a technique that is used in molecular biology to
study the interaction of suitable proteins.¹⁰⁸

Several different kinds of hardware random number generator involve the
detection of single photons. In one example, for each bit in the random
sequence that is to be produced, a photon is sent to a beam-splitter. In
such a situation, there are two possible outcomes of equal probability. The
actual outcome is used to determine whether the next bit in the sequence is
"0" or "1".¹⁰⁹ ¹¹⁰

Recent research

See also: Quantum optics

Much research has been devoted to applications of photons in the field of
quantum optics. Photons seem well-suited to be elements of an extremely
fast quantum computer, and the quantum entanglement of photons is a focus
of research. Nonlinear optical processes are another active research area,
with topics such as two-photon absorption, self-phase modulation,
modulational instability and optical parametric oscillators. However, such
processes generally do not require the assumption of photons per se; they
may often be modeled by treating atoms as nonlinear oscillators. The
nonlinear process of spontaneous parametric down conversion is often used
to produce single-photon states. Finally, photons are essential in some
aspects of optical communication, especially for quantum cryptography.[Note

Notes

[1] Although the 1967 Elsevier translation of Planck's Nobel Lecture
  interprets Planck's Lichtquant as "photon", the more literal 1922
  translation by Hans Thacher Clarke and Ludwik Silberstein The origin and
  development of the quantum theory, The Clarendon Press, 1922 (here ) uses
  "light-quantum". No evidence is known that Planck himself used the term
  "photon" by 1926 (see also this note).

[3] The mass of the photon is believed to be exactly zero, based on
  experiment and theoretical considerations described in the article. Some
  sources also refer to the relativistic mass concept, which is just the
  energy scaled to units of mass. For a photon with wavelength λ or energy
  E, this is h/λc or E/c². This usage for the term "mass" is no longer
  common in scientific literature. Further info: What is the mass of a
  photon?

[4] The phrase "no matter how intense" refers to intensities below
  approximately 10¹³ W/cm² at which point perturbation theory begins to
  break down. In contrast, in the intense regime, which for visible light
  is above approximately 10¹⁴ W/cm², the classical wave description
  correctly predicts the energy acquired by electrons, called ponderomotive
  energy. (See also: Boreham et al. (1996). "Photon density and the
  correspondence principle of electromagnetic interaction".) By comparison,
  sunlight is only about 0.1 W/cm².
[5] These experiments produce results that cannot be explained by any
  classical theory of light, since they involve anticorrelations that
  result from the quantum measurement process. In 1974, the first such
  experiment was carried out by Clauser, who reported a violation of a
  classical Cauchy–Schwarz inequality. In 1977, Kimble et al. demonstrated
  an analogous anti-bunching effect of photons interacting with a beam
  splitter; this approach was simplified and sources of error eliminated in
  the photon-anticorrelation experiment of Grangier et al. (1986). This
  work is reviewed and simplified further in Thorn et al. (2004). (These
  references are listed below under #Additional references.)

Planet

This article is about the astronomical object. For other uses, see Planet
(disambiguation).

A planet (from Ancient Greek ἀστήρ πλανήτης (astēr planētēs), or πλάνης
ἀστήρ (plánēs astēr), meaning "wandering star")¹ is an astronomical object
orbiting a star, brown dwarf, or stellar remnant that

- is massive enough to be rounded by its own gravity,
- is not massive enough to cause thermonuclear fusion, and
- has cleared its neighbouring region of planetesimals.[lower-alpha 1]² ³

The term planet is ancient, with ties to history, science, mythology, and
religion. Several planets in the Solar System can be seen with the naked
eye. These were regarded by many early cultures as divine, or as emissaries
of deities. As scientific knowledge advanced, human perception of the
planets changed, incorporating a number of disparate objects. In 2006, the
International Astronomical Union (IAU) officially adopted a resolution
defining planets within the Solar System. This definition is controversial
because it excludes many objects of planetary mass based on where or what
they orbit. Although eight of the planetary bodies discovered before 1950
remain "planets" under the modern definition, some celestial bodies, such
as Ceres, Pallas, Juno, Vesta (each an object in the solar asteroid belt),
and Pluto (the first trans-Neptunian object discovered), that were once
considered planets by the scientific community are no longer viewed as
such.

The planets were thought by Ptolemy to orbit Earth in deferent and epicycle
motions. Although the idea that the planets orbited the Sun had been
suggested many times, it was not until the 17th century that this view was
supported by evidence from the first telescopic astronomical observations,
performed by Galileo Galilei. By careful analysis of the observation data,
Johannes Kepler found the planets' orbits were not circular but elliptical.
As observational tools improved, astronomers saw that, like Earth, the
planets rotated around tilted axes, and some shared such features as ice
caps and seasons. Since the dawn of the Space Age, close observation by
space probes has found that Earth and the other planets share
characteristics such as volcanism, hurricanes, tectonics, and even
hydrology.

Planets are generally divided into two main types: large low-density giant
planets, and smaller rocky terrestrials. Under IAU definitions, there are
eight planets in the Solar System. In order of increasing distance from the
Sun, they are the four terrestrials, Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars, then
the four giant planets, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Six of the
planets are orbited by one or more natural satellites.

More than a thousand planets around other stars ("extrasolar planets" or
"exoplanets") have been discovered in the Milky Way: as of 1 October 2015,
1968 known extrasolar planets in 1248 planetary systems (including 490
multiple planetary systems), ranging in size from just above the size of
the Moon to gas giants about twice as large as Jupiter.⁴ On December 20,
2011, the Kepler Space Telescope team reported the discovery of the first
Earth-sized extrasolar planets, Kepler-20e⁵ and Kepler-20f,⁶ orbiting a
Sun-like star, Kepler-20.⁷ ⁸ ⁹ A 2012 study, analyzing gravitational
microlensing data, estimates an average of at least 1.6 bound planets for
every star in the Milky Way.¹⁰ Around one in five Sun-like[lower-alpha 2]
stars is thought to have an Earth-sized[lower-alpha 3] planet in its
habitable[lower-alpha 4] zone.

History

Further information: History of astronomy, Definition of planet and
Timeline of Solar System astronomy

The idea of planets has evolved over its history, from the divine wandering
stars of antiquity to the earthly objects of the scientific age. The
concept has expanded to include worlds not only in the Solar System, but in
hundreds of other extrasolar systems. The ambiguities inherent in defining
planets have led to much scientific controversy.

The five classical planets, being visible to the naked eye, have been known
since ancient times and have had a significant impact on mythology,
religious cosmology, and ancient astronomy. In ancient times, astronomers
noted how certain lights moved across the sky in relation to the other
stars. Ancient Greeks called these lights πλάνητες ἀστέρες (planētes
asteres, "wandering stars") or simply πλανῆται (planētai, "wanderers"),¹¹
from which today's word "planet" was derived.¹² ¹³ In ancient Greece,
China, Babylon, and indeed all pre-modern civilizations,¹⁴ ¹⁵ it was almost
universally believed that Earth was the center of the Universe and that all
the "planets" circled Earth. The reasons for this perception were that
stars and planets appeared to revolve around Earth each day¹⁶ and the
apparently common-sense perceptions that Earth was solid and stable and
that it was not moving but at rest.

Babylon

Main article: Babylonian astronomy

The first civilization known to have a functional theory of the planets
were the Babylonians, who lived in Mesopotamia in the first and second
millennia BC. The oldest surviving planetary astronomical text is the
Babylonian Venus tablet of Ammisaduqa, a 7th-century BC copy of a list of
observations of the motions of the planet Venus, that probably dates as
early as the second millennium BC.¹⁷ The MUL.APIN is a pair of cuneiform
tablets dating from the 7th century BC that lays out the motions of the
Sun, Moon and planets over the course of the year.¹⁸ The Babylonian
astrologers also laid the foundations of what would eventually become
Western astrology.¹⁹ The Enuma anu enlil, written during the Neo-Assyrian
period in the 7th century BC,²⁰ comprises a list of omens and their
relationships with various celestial phenomena including the motions of the
planets.²¹ ²² Venus, Mercury and the outer planets Mars, Jupiter and Saturn
were all identified by Babylonian astronomers. These would remain the only
known planets until the invention of the telescope in early modern times.²³

Greco-Roman astronomy

See also: Greek astronomy

The ancient Greeks initially did not attach as much significance to the
planets as the Babylonians. The Pythagoreans, in the 6th and 5th centuries
BC appear to have developed their own independent planetary theory, which
consisted of the Earth, Sun, Moon, and planets revolving around a "Central
Fire" at the center of the Universe. Pythagoras or Parmenides is said to
have been the first to identify the evening star (Hesperos) and morning
star (Phosphoros) as one and the same (Aphrodite, Greek corresponding to
Latin Venus).²⁴ In the 3rd century BC, Aristarchus of Samos proposed a
heliocentric system, according to which Earth and the planets revolved
around the Sun. The geocentric system remained dominant until the
Scientific Revolution.

By the 1st century BC, during the Hellenistic period, the Greeks had begun
to develop their own mathematical schemes for predicting the positions of
the planets. These schemes, which were based on geometry rather than the
arithmetic of the Babylonians, would eventually eclipse the Babylonians'
theories in complexity and comprehensiveness, and account for most of the
astronomical movements observed from Earth with the naked eye. These
theories would reach their fullest expression in the Almagest written by
Ptolemy in the 2nd century CE. So complete was the domination of Ptolemy's
model that it superseded all previous works on astronomy and remained the
definitive astronomical text in the Western world for 13 centuries.¹⁷ ²⁵ To
the Greeks and Romans there were seven known planets, each presumed to be
circling Earth according to the complex laws laid out by Ptolemy. They
were, in increasing order from Earth (in Ptolemy's order): the Moon,
Mercury, Venus, the Sun, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn.¹³ ²⁵ ²⁶

India

Main articles: Indian astronomy and Hindu cosmology

In 499 CE, the Indian astronomer Aryabhata propounded a planetary model
that explicitly incorporated Earth's rotation about its axis, which he
explains as the cause of what appears to be an apparent westward motion of
the stars. He also believed that the orbits of planets are elliptical.²⁷
Aryabhata's followers were particularly strong in South India, where his
principles of the diurnal rotation of Earth, among others, were followed
and a number of secondary works were based on them.²⁸

In 1500, Nilakantha Somayaji of the Kerala school of astronomy and
mathematics, in his Tantrasangraha, revised Aryabhata's model.²⁹ In his
Aryabhatiyabhasya, a commentary on Aryabhata's Aryabhatiya, he developed a
planetary model where Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn orbit the
Sun, which in turn orbits Earth, similar to the Tychonic system later
proposed by Tycho Brahe in the late 16th century. Most astronomers of the
Kerala school who followed him accepted his planetary model.²⁹ ³⁰

Medieval Muslim astronomy

Main articles: Astronomy in medieval Islam and Islamic cosmology

In the 11th century, the transit of Venus was observed by Avicenna, who
established that Venus was, at least sometimes, below the Sun.³¹ In the
12th century, Ibn Bajjah observed "two planets as black spots on the face
of the Sun", which was later identified as a transit of Mercury and Venus
by the Maragha astronomer Qotb al-Din Shirazi in the 13th century.³² Ibn
Bajjah could not have observed a transit of Venus, because none occurred in
his lifetime.³³

European Renaissance

See also: Heliocentrism

With the advent of the Scientific Revolution, use of the term "planet"
changed from something that moved across the sky (in relation to the star
field); to a body that orbited Earth (or that were believed to do so at the
time); and by the 18th century to something that directly orbited the Sun
when the heliocentric model of Copernicus, Galileo and Kepler gained sway.

Thus, Earth became included in the list of planets,³⁴ whereas the Sun and
Moon were excluded. At first, when the first satellites of Jupiter and
Saturn were discovered in the 17th century, the terms "planet" and
"satellite" were used interchangeably – although the latter would gradually
become more prevalent in the following century.³⁵ Until the mid-19th
century, the number of "planets" rose rapidly because any newly discovered
object directly orbiting the Sun was listed as a planet by the scientific
community.

19th century

In the 19th century astronomers began to realize that recently discovered
bodies that had been classified as planets for almost half a century (such
as Ceres, Pallas, and Vesta) were very different from the traditional ones.
These bodies shared the same region of space between Mars and Jupiter (the
asteroid belt), and had a much smaller mass; as a result they were
reclassified as "asteroids". In the absence of any formal definition, a
"planet" came to be understood as any "large" body that orbited the Sun.
Because there was a dramatic size gap between the asteroids and the
planets, and the spate of new discoveries seemed to have ended after the
discovery of Neptune in 1846, there was no apparent need to have a formal
definition.³⁶

20th century

In the 20th century, Pluto was discovered. After initial observations led
to the belief it was larger than Earth,³⁷ the object was immediately
accepted as the ninth planet. Further monitoring found the body was
actually much smaller: in 1936, Raymond Lyttleton suggested that Pluto may
be an escaped satellite of Neptune,³⁸ and Fred Whipple suggested in 1964
that Pluto may be a comet.³⁹ As it was still larger than all known
asteroids and seemingly did not exist within a larger population,⁴⁰ it kept
its status until 2006.

In 1992, astronomers Aleksander Wolszczan and Dale Frail announced the
discovery of planets around a pulsar, PSR B1257+12.⁴¹ This discovery is
generally considered to be the first definitive detection of a planetary
system around another star. Then, on October 6, 1995, Michel Mayor and
Didier Queloz of the Geneva Observatory announced the first definitive
detection of an exoplanet orbiting an ordinary main-sequence star (51
Pegasi).⁴²

The discovery of extrasolar planets led to another ambiguity in defining a
planet: the point at which a planet becomes a star. Many known extrasolar
planets are many times the mass of Jupiter, approaching that of stellar
objects known as brown dwarfs.⁴³ Brown dwarfs are generally considered
stars due to their ability to fuse deuterium, a heavier isotope of
hydrogen. Although objects more massive than 75 times that of Jupiter fuse
hydrogen, objects of only 13 Jupiter masses can fuse deuterium. Deuterium
is quite rare, and most brown dwarfs would have ceased fusing deuterium
long before their discovery, making them effectively indistinguishable from
supermassive planets.⁴⁴

21st century

With the discovery during the latter half of the 20th century of more
objects within the Solar System and large objects around other stars,
disputes arose over what should constitute a planet. There were particular
disagreements over whether an object should be considered a planet if it
was part of a distinct population such as a belt, or if it was large enough
to generate energy by the thermonuclear fusion of deuterium.

A growing number of astronomers argued for Pluto to be declassified as a
planet, because many similar objects approaching its size had been found in
the same region of the Solar System (the Kuiper belt) during the 1990s and
early 2000s. Pluto was found to be just one small body in a population of
thousands.

Some of them, such as Quaoar, Sedna, and Eris, were heralded in the popular
press as the tenth planet, failing to receive widespread scientific
recognition. The announcement of Eris in 2005, an object 27% more massive
than Pluto, created the necessity and public desire for an official
definition of a planet.

Acknowledging the problem, the IAU set about creating the definition of
planet, and produced one in August 2006. The number of planets dropped to
the eight significantly larger bodies that had cleared their orbit
(Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune), and a
new class of dwarf planets was created, initially containing three objects
(Ceres, Pluto and Eris).⁴⁵

Extrasolar planet definition

In 2003, The International Astronomical Union (IAU) Working Group on
Extrasolar Planets made a position statement on the definition of a planet
that incorporated the following working definition, mostly focused upon the
boundary between planets and brown dwarfs:³

- Objects with true masses below the limiting mass for thermonuclear fusion
  of deuterium (currently calculated to be 13 times the mass of Jupiter for
  objects with the same isotopic abundance as the Sun⁴⁶ ) that orbit stars
  or stellar remnants are "planets" (no matter how they formed). The
  minimum mass and size required for an extrasolar object to be considered
  a planet should be the same as that used in the Solar System.
- Substellar objects with true masses above the limiting mass for
  thermonuclear fusion of deuterium are "brown dwarfs", no matter how they
  formed or where they are located.
- Free-floating objects in young star clusters with masses below the
  limiting mass for thermonuclear fusion of deuterium are not "planets",
  but are "sub-brown dwarfs" (or whatever name is most appropriate).

This definition has since been widely used by astronomers when publishing
discoveries of exoplanets in academic journals.⁴⁷ Although temporary, it
remains an effective working definition until a more permanent one is
formally adopted. It does not address the dispute over the lower mass
limit,⁴⁸ and so it steered clear of the controversy regarding objects
within the Solar System. This definition also makes no comment on the
planetary status of objects orbiting brown dwarfs, such as 2M1207b.

One definition of a sub-brown dwarf is a planet-mass object that formed
through cloud collapse rather than accretion. This formation distinction
between a sub-brown dwarf and a planet is not universally agreed upon;
astronomers are divided into two camps as whether to consider the formation
process of a planet as part of its division in classification.⁴⁹ One reason
for the dissent is that often it may not be possible to determine the
formation process. For example, a planet formed by accretion around a star
may get ejected from the system to become free-floating, and likewise a
sub-brown dwarf that formed on its own in a star cluster through cloud
collapse may get captured into orbit around a star.

The 13 Jupiter-mass cutoff is a rule of thumb rather than something of
precise physical significance. The question arises: what is meant by
deuterium burning? This question arises because large objects will burn
most of their deuterium and smaller ones will burn only a little, and the
13 MJ value is somewhere in between. The amount of deuterium burnt depends
not only on mass but also on the composition of the planet, on the amount
of helium and deuterium present.⁵⁰ The Extrasolar Planets Encyclopaedia
includes objects up to 25 Jupiter masses, saying, "The fact that there is
no special feature around 13 MJ in the observed mass spectrum reinforces
the choice to forget this mass limit."⁵¹ The Exoplanet Data Explorer
includes objects up to 24 Jupiter masses with the advisory: "The 13
Jupiter-mass distinction by the IAU Working Group is physically unmotivated
for planets with rocky cores, and observationally problematic due to the
sin i ambiguity."⁵² The NASA Exoplanet Archive includes objects with a mass
(or minimum mass) equal to or less than 30 Jupiter masses.⁵³

Another criterion for separating planets and brown dwarfs, rather than
deuterium burning, formation process or location, is whether the core
pressure is dominated by coulomb pressure or electron degeneracy
pressure.⁵⁴ ⁵⁵

2006 definition

Main article: IAU definition of planet

The matter of the lower limit was addressed during the 2006 meeting of the
IAU's General Assembly. After much debate and one failed proposal, 232
members of the 10,000 member assembly, who nevertheless constituted a large
majority of those remaining at the meeting, voted to pass a resolution. The
2006 resolution redefines planets within the Solar System as:²

  A celestial body that (a) is in orbit around the Sun, (b) has sufficient
  mass for its self-gravity to overcome rigid body forces so that it
  assumes a hydrostatic equilibrium (nearly round) shape, and (c) has
  cleared the neighbourhood around its orbit.

Under this definition, the Solar System is considered to have eight
planets. Bodies that fulfill the first two conditions but not the third
(such as Ceres, Pluto, and Eris) are classified as dwarf planets, provided
they are not also natural satellites of other planets. Originally an IAU
committee had proposed a definition that would have included a much larger
number of planets as it did not include (c) as a criterion.⁵⁶ After much
discussion, it was decided via a vote that those bodies should instead be
classified as dwarf planets.⁵⁷

This definition is based in theories of planetary formation, in which
planetary embryos initially clear their orbital neighborhood of other
smaller objects. As described by astronomer Steven Soter:⁵⁸

  The end product of secondary disk accretion is a small number of
  relatively large bodies (planets) in either non-intersecting or resonant
  orbits, which prevent collisions between them. Minor planets and comets,
  including KBOs [Kuiper belt objects], differ from planets in that they
  can collide with each other and with planets.

Beyond the scientific community, Pluto still holds cultural significance
for many in the general public due to its historical classification as a
planet from 1930 to 2006.⁵⁹

Objects formerly considered planets

The table below lists Solar System bodies once considered to be planets.

A few astronomers, such as Alan Stern, consider dwarf planets and the
larger moons to be planets, based on a purely geophysical definition of
planet.⁶⁵

Mythology and naming

See also: Weekday names and Naked-eye planet

The names for the planets in the Western world are derived from the naming
practices of the Romans, which ultimately derive from those of the Greeks
and the Babylonians. In ancient Greece, the two great luminaries the Sun
and the Moon were called Helios and Selene; the farthest planet (Saturn)
was called Phainon, the shiner; followed by Phaethon (Jupiter), "bright";
the red planet (Mars) was known as Pyroeis, the "fiery"; the brightest
(Venus) was known as Phosphoros, the light bringer; and the fleeting final
planet (Mercury) was called Stilbon, the gleamer. The Greeks also made each
planet sacred to one among their pantheon of gods, the Olympians: Helios
and Selene were the names of both planets and gods; Phainon was sacred to
Cronus, the Titan who fathered the Olympians; Phaethon was sacred to Zeus,
Cronus's son who deposed him as king; Pyroeis was given to Ares, son of
Zeus and god of war; Phosphoros was ruled by Aphrodite, the goddess of
love; and Hermes, messenger of the gods and god of learning and wit, ruled
over Stilbon.¹⁷

The Greek practice of grafting of their gods' names onto the planets was
almost certainly borrowed from the Babylonians. The Babylonians named
Phosphoros after their goddess of love, Ishtar; Pyroeis after their god of
war, Nergal, Stilbon after their god of wisdom Nabu, and Phaethon after
their chief god, Marduk.⁶⁶ There are too many concordances between Greek
and Babylonian naming conventions for them to have arisen separately.¹⁷ The
translation was not perfect. For instance, the Babylonian Nergal was a god
of war, and thus the Greeks identified him with Ares. Unlike Ares, Nergal
was also god of pestilence and the underworld.⁶⁷

Today, most people in the western world know the planets by names derived
from the Olympian pantheon of gods. Although modern Greeks still use their
ancient names for the planets, other European languages, because of the
influence of the Roman Empire and, later, the Catholic Church, use the
Roman (Latin) names rather than the Greek ones. The Romans, who, like the
Greeks, were Indo-Europeans, shared with them a common pantheon under
different names but lacked the rich narrative traditions that Greek poetic
culture had given their gods. During the later period of the Roman
Republic, Roman writers borrowed much of the Greek narratives and applied
them to their own pantheon, to the point where they became virtually
indistinguishable.⁶⁸ When the Romans studied Greek astronomy, they gave the
planets their own gods' names: Mercurius (for Hermes), Venus (Aphrodite),
Mars (Ares), Iuppiter (Zeus) and Saturnus (Cronus). When subsequent planets
were discovered in the 18th and 19th centuries, the naming practice was
retained with Neptūnus (Poseidon). Uranus is unique in that it is named for
a Greek deity rather than his Roman counterpart.

Some Romans, following a belief possibly originating in Mesopotamia but
developed in Hellenistic Egypt, believed that the seven gods after whom the
planets were named took hourly shifts in looking after affairs on Earth.
The order of shifts went Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Sun, Venus, Mercury, Moon
(from the farthest to the closest planet).⁶⁹ Therefore, the first day was
started by Saturn (1st hour), second day by Sun (25th hour), followed by
Moon (49th hour), Mars, Mercury, Jupiter and Venus. Because each day was
named by the god that started it, this is also the order of the days of the
week in the Roman calendar after the Nundinal cycle was rejected – and
still preserved in many modern languages.⁷⁰ In English, Saturday, Sunday,
and Monday are straightforward translations of these Roman names. The other
days were renamed after Tiw, (Tuesday) Wóden (Wednesday), Thunor
(Thursday), and Fríge (Friday), the Anglo-Saxon gods considered similar or
equivalent to Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, and Venus, respectively.

Earth is the only planet whose name in English is not derived from
Greco-Roman mythology. Because it was only generally accepted as a planet
in the 17th century,³⁴ there is no tradition of naming it after a god. (The
same is true, in English at least, of the Sun and the Moon, though they are
no longer generally considered planets.) The name originates from the 8th
century Anglo-Saxon word erda, which means ground or soil and was first
used in writing as the name of the sphere of Earth perhaps around 1300.⁷¹
⁷² As with its equivalents in the other Germanic languages, it derives
ultimately from the Proto-Germanic word ertho, "ground",⁷² as can be seen
in the English earth, the German Erde, the Dutch aarde, and the
Scandinavian jord. Many of the Romance languages retain the old Roman word
terra (or some variation of it) that was used with the meaning of "dry
land" as opposed to "sea".⁷³ The non-Romance languages use their own native
words. The Greeks retain their original name, Γή (Ge).

Non-European cultures use other planetary-naming systems. India uses a
system based on the Navagraha, which incorporates the seven traditional
planets (Surya for the Sun, Chandra for the Moon, and Budha, Shukra,
Mangala, Bṛhaspati and Shani for Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn)
and the ascending and descending lunar nodes Rahu and Ketu. China and the
countries of eastern Asia historically subject to Chinese cultural
influence (such as Japan, Korea and Vietnam) use a naming system based on
the five Chinese elements: water (Mercury), metal (Venus), fire (Mars),
wood (Jupiter) and earth (Saturn).⁷⁰

Formation

Main article: Nebular hypothesis

It is not known with certainty how planets are formed. The prevailing
theory is that they are formed during the collapse of a nebula into a thin
disk of gas and dust. A protostar forms at the core, surrounded by a
rotating protoplanetary disk. Through accretion (a process of sticky
collision) dust particles in the disk steadily accumulate mass to form
ever-larger bodies. Local concentrations of mass known as planetesimals
form, and these accelerate the accretion process by drawing in additional
material by their gravitational attraction. These concentrations become
ever denser until they collapse inward under gravity to form
protoplanets.⁷⁴ After a planet reaches a diameter larger than the Moon, it
begins to accumulate an extended atmosphere, greatly increasing the capture
rate of the planetesimals by means of atmospheric drag.⁷⁵

When the protostar has grown such that it ignites to form a star, the
surviving disk is removed from the inside outward by photoevaporation, the
solar wind, Poynting–Robertson drag and other effects.⁷⁶ ⁷⁷ Thereafter
there still may be many protoplanets orbiting the star or each other, but
over time many will collide, either to form a single larger planet or
release material for other larger protoplanets or planets to absorb.⁷⁸
Those objects that have become massive enough will capture most matter in
their orbital neighbourhoods to become planets. Protoplanets that have
avoided collisions may become natural satellites of planets through a
process of gravitational capture, or remain in belts of other objects to
become either dwarf planets or small bodies.

The energetic impacts of the smaller planetesimals (as well as radioactive
decay) will heat up the growing planet, causing it to at least partially
melt. The interior of the planet begins to differentiate by mass,
developing a denser core.⁷⁹ Smaller terrestrial planets lose most of their
atmospheres because of this accretion, but the lost gases can be replaced
by outgassing from the mantle and from the subsequent impact of comets.⁸⁰
(Smaller planets will lose any atmosphere they gain through various escape
mechanisms.)

With the discovery and observation of planetary systems around stars other
than the Sun, it is becoming possible to elaborate, revise or even replace
this account. The level of metallicity—an astronomical term describing the
abundance of chemical elements with an atomic number greater than 2
(helium)—is now believed to determine the likelihood that a star will have
planets.⁸¹ Hence, it is thought that a metal-rich population I star will
likely have a more substantial planetary system than a metal-poor,
population II star.

See also: List of gravitationally rounded objects of the Solar System

There are eight planets in the Solar System, which are in increasing
distance from the Sun:

- Mercury
- Venus
- Earth
- Mars
- Jupiter
- Saturn
- Uranus
- Neptune

Jupiter is the largest, at 318 Earth masses, whereas Mercury is the
smallest, at 0.055 Earth masses.

The planets of the Solar System can be divided into categories based on
their composition:

- Terrestrials: Planets that are similar to Earth, with bodies largely
  composed of rock: Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars. At 0.055 Earth masses,
  Mercury is the smallest terrestrial planet (and smallest planet) in the
  Solar System. Earth is the largest terrestrial planet.
- Giant planets (Jovians): Massive planets significantly more massive than
  the terrestrials: Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune.
  + Gas giants, Jupiter and Saturn, are giant planets primarily composed of
    hydrogen and helium and are the most massive planets in the Solar
    System. Jupiter, at 318 Earth masses, is the largest planet in the
    Solar System, and Saturn is one third as massive, at 95 Earth masses.
  + Ice giants, Uranus and Neptune, are primarily composed of
    low-boiling-point materials such as water, methane, and ammonia, with
    thick atmospheres of hydrogen and helium. They have a significantly
    lower mass than the gas giants (only 14 and 17 Earth masses).

Planetary attributes

Exoplanets

Main article: Exoplanet

An exoplanet (extrasolar planet) is a planet outside the Solar System.
Around 1800 such planets have been discovered⁸³ ⁸⁴ ⁸⁵ (1968 planets in 1248
planetary systems including 490 multiple planetary systems as of 1 October
2015).⁴

In early 1992, radio astronomers Aleksander Wolszczan and Dale Frail
announced the discovery of two planets orbiting the pulsar PSR 1257+12.⁴¹
This discovery was confirmed, and is generally considered to be the first
definitive detection of exoplanets. These pulsar planets are believed to
have formed from the unusual remnants of the supernova that produced the
pulsar, in a second round of planet formation, or else to be the remaining
rocky cores of giant planets that survived the supernova and then decayed
into their current orbits.

The first confirmed discovery of an extrasolar planet orbiting an ordinary
main-sequence star occurred on 6 October 1995, when Michel Mayor and Didier
Queloz of the University of Geneva announced the detection of an exoplanet
around 51 Pegasi. From then until the Kepler mission most known extrasolar
planets were gas giants comparable in mass to Jupiter or larger as they
were more easily detected. The catalog of Kepler candidate planets consists
mostly of planets the size of Neptune and smaller, down to smaller than
Mercury.

There are types of planets that do not exist in the Solar System:
super-Earths and mini-Neptunes, which could be rocky like Earth or a
mixture of volatiles and gas like Neptune—a radius of 1.75 times that of
Earth is a possible dividing line between the two types of planet.⁸⁶ There
are hot Jupiters that orbit very close to their star and may evaporate to
become chthonian planets, which are the leftover cores. Another possible
type of planet is carbon planets, which form in systems with a higher
proportion of carbon than in the Solar System.

A 2012 study, analyzing gravitational microlensing data, estimates an
average of at least 1.6 bound planets for every star in the Milky Way.¹⁰

On December 20, 2011, the Kepler Space Telescope team reported the
discovery of the first Earth-size exoplanets, Kepler-20e⁵ and Kepler-20f,⁶
orbiting a Sun-like star, Kepler-20.⁷ ⁸ ⁹

Around 1 in 5 Sun-like[lower-alpha 2] stars have an
"Earth-sized"[lower-alpha 3] planet in the habitable[lower-alpha 4] zone,
so the nearest would be expected to be within 12 light-years distance from
Earth.⁸⁷ ⁸⁸ The frequency of occurrence of such terrestrial planets is one
of the variables in the Drake equation, which estimates the number of
intelligent, communicating civilizations that exist in the Milky Way.⁸⁹

There are exoplanets that are much closer to their parent star than any
planet in the Solar System is to the Sun, and there are also exoplanets
that are much further from their star. Mercury, the closest planet to the
Sun at 0.4AU, takes 88-days for an orbit, but the shortest known orbits for
exoplanets take only a few hours, e.g. Kepler-70b. The Kepler-11 system has
five of its planets in shorter orbits than Mercury. Neptune is 30AU from
the Sun and takes 165 years to orbit, but there are exoplanets that are
hundreds of AU from their star and take more than a thousand years to
orbit, e.g. 1RXS1609 b.

The next few space telescopes to study exoplanets are expected to be Gaia
launched in December 2013, CHEOPS in 2017, TESS in 2017, and the James Webb
Space Telescope in 2018.

Planetary-mass objects

See also: List of gravitationally rounded objects of the Solar System

A planetary-mass object (PMO), planemo⁹⁰ /ˈplænɨmoʊ/, or planetary body is
a celestial object with a mass that falls within the range of the
definition of a planet: massive enough to achieve hydrostatic equilibrium
(to be rounded under its own gravity), but not enough to sustain core
fusion like a star.⁹¹ ⁹² By definition, all planets are planetary-mass
objects, but the purpose of this term is to refer to objects that do not
conform to typical expectations for a planet. These include dwarf planets,
which are rounded by their own gravity but not massive enough to clear
their own orbit, the larger moons, and free-floating planemos, which may
have been ejected from a system (rogue planets) or formed through
cloud-collapse rather than accretion (sometimes called sub-brown dwarfs).

Rogue planets

Main article: Rogue planet

Several computer simulations of stellar and planetary system formation have
suggested that some objects of planetary mass would be ejected into
interstellar space.⁹³ Some scientists have argued that such objects found
roaming in deep space should be classed as "planets", although others have
suggested that they should be called low-mass brown dwarfs.⁹⁴ ⁹⁵

Sub-brown dwarfs

Main article: Sub-brown dwarf

Stars form via the gravitational collapse of gas clouds, but smaller
objects can also form via cloud-collapse. Planetary-mass objects formed
this way are sometimes called sub-brown dwarfs. Sub-brown dwarfs may be
free-floating such as Cha 110913-773444⁹⁴ and OTS 44,⁹⁶ or orbiting a
larger object such as 2MASS J04414489+2301513.

For a brief time in 2006, astronomers believed they had found a binary
system of such objects, Oph 162225-240515, which the discoverers described
as "planemos", or "planetary-mass objects". Recent analysis of the objects
has determined that their masses are probably each greater than 13
Jupiter-masses, making the pair brown dwarfs.⁹⁷ ⁹⁸ ⁹⁹

Former stars

In close binary star systems one of the stars can lose mass to a heavier
companion. Accretion-powered pulsars may drive mass loss. The shrinking
star can then become a planetary-mass object. An example is a Jupiter-mass
object orbiting the pulsar PSR J1719-1438.¹⁰⁰ These shrunken white dwarfs
may become a helium planet or diamond planet.

Satellite planets and belt planets

Some large satellites are of similar size or larger than the planet
Mercury, e.g. Jupiter's Galilean moons and Titan. Alan Stern has argued
that location should not matter and that only geophysical attributes should
be taken into account in the definition of a planet, and proposes the term
satellite planet for a planet-sized satellite. Likewise, dwarf planets in
the asteroid belt and Kuiper belt should be considered planets according to
Stern.⁶⁵

Captured planets

Free-floating planets in stellar clusters have similar velocities to the
stars and so can be recaptured. They are typically captured into wide
orbits between 100 and 10⁵ AU. The capture efficiency decreases with
increasing cluster volume, and for a given cluster size it increases with
the host/primary mass. It is almost independent of the planetary mass.
Single and multiple planets could be captured into arbitrary unaligned
orbits, non-coplanar with each other or with the stellar host spin, or
pre-existing planetary system.¹⁰¹

Attributes

Although each planet has unique physical characteristics, a number of broad
commonalities do exist among them. Some of these characteristics, such as
rings or natural satellites, have only as yet been observed in planets in
the Solar System, whereas others are also commonly observed in extrasolar
planets.

Dynamic characteristics

Orbit

Main articles: Orbit and Orbital elements
See also: Kepler's laws of planetary motion

According to current definitions, all planets must revolve around stars;
thus, any potential "rogue planets" are excluded. In the Solar System, all
the planets orbit the Sun in the same direction as the Sun rotates
(counter-clockwise as seen from above the Sun's north pole). At least one
extrasolar planet, WASP-17b, has been found to orbit in the opposite
direction to its star's rotation.¹⁰² The period of one revolution of a
planet's orbit is known as its sidereal period or year.¹⁰³ A planet's year
depends on its distance from its star; the farther a planet is from its
star, not only the longer the distance it must travel, but also the slower
its speed, because it is less affected by its star's gravity. No planet's
orbit is perfectly circular, and hence the distance of each varies over the
course of its year. The closest approach to its star is called its
periastron (perihelion in the Solar System), whereas its farthest
separation from the star is called its apastron (aphelion). As a planet
approaches periastron, its speed increases as it trades gravitational
potential energy for kinetic energy, just as a falling object on Earth
accelerates as it falls; as the planet reaches apastron, its speed
decreases, just as an object thrown upwards on Earth slows down as it
reaches the apex of its trajectory.¹⁰⁴

Each planet's orbit is delineated by a set of elements:

- The eccentricity of an orbit describes how elongated a planet's orbit is.
  Planets with low eccentricities have more circular orbits, whereas
  planets with high eccentricities have more elliptical orbits. The planets
  in the Solar System have very low eccentricities, and thus nearly
  circular orbits.¹⁰³ Comets and Kuiper belt objects (as well as several
  extrasolar planets) have very high eccentricities, and thus exceedingly
  elliptical orbits.¹⁰⁵ ¹⁰⁶
- The semi-major axis is the distance from a planet to the half-way point
  along the longest diameter of its elliptical orbit (see image). This
  distance is not the same as its apastron, because no planet's orbit has
  its star at its exact centre.¹⁰³
- The inclination of a planet tells how far above or below an established
  reference plane its orbit lies. In the Solar System, the reference plane
  is the plane of Earth's orbit, called the ecliptic. For extrasolar
  planets, the plane, known as the sky plane or plane of the sky, is the
  plane perpendicular to the observer's line of sight from Earth.¹⁰⁷ The
  eight planets of the Solar System all lie very close to the ecliptic;
  comets and Kuiper belt objects like Pluto are at far more extreme angles
  to it.¹⁰⁸ The points at which a planet crosses above and below its
  reference plane are called its ascending and descending nodes.¹⁰³ The
  longitude of the ascending node is the angle between the reference
  plane's 0 longitude and the planet's ascending node. The argument of
  periapsis (or perihelion in the Solar System) is the angle between a
  planet's ascending node and its closest approach to its star.¹⁰³

Axial tilt

Main article: Axial tilt

Planets also have varying degrees of axial tilt; they lie at an angle to
the plane of their stars' equators. This causes the amount of light
received by each hemisphere to vary over the course of its year; when the
northern hemisphere points away from its star, the southern hemisphere
points towards it, and vice versa. Each planet therefore has seasons;
changes to the climate over the course of its year. The time at which each
hemisphere points farthest or nearest from its star is known as its
solstice. Each planet has two in the course of its orbit; when one
hemisphere has its summer solstice, when its day is longest, the other has
its winter solstice, when its day is shortest. The varying amount of light
and heat received by each hemisphere creates annual changes in weather
patterns for each half of the planet. Jupiter's axial tilt is very small,
so its seasonal variation is minimal; Uranus, on the other hand, has an
axial tilt so extreme it is virtually on its side, which means that its
hemispheres are either perpetually in sunlight or perpetually in darkness
around the time of its solstices.¹⁰⁹ Among extrasolar planets, axial tilts
are not known for certain, though most hot Jupiters are believed to have
negligible to no axial tilt as a result of their proximity to their
stars.¹¹⁰

Rotation

The planets rotate around invisible axes through their centres. A planet's
rotation period is known as a stellar day. Most of the planets in the Solar
System rotate in the same direction as they orbit the Sun, which is
counter-clockwise as seen from above the Sun's north pole, the exceptions
being Venus¹¹¹ and Uranus,¹¹² which rotate clockwise, though Uranus's
extreme axial tilt means there are differing conventions on which of its
poles is "north", and therefore whether it is rotating clockwise or
anti-clockwise.¹¹³ Regardless of which convention is used, Uranus has a
retrograde rotation relative to its orbit.

The rotation of a planet can be induced by several factors during
formation. A net angular momentum can be induced by the individual angular
momentum contributions of accreted objects. The accretion of gas by the
giant planets can also contribute to the angular momentum. Finally, during
the last stages of planet building, a stochastic process of protoplanetary
accretion can randomly alter the spin axis of the planet.¹¹⁴ There is great
variation in the length of day between the planets, with Venus taking 243
days to rotate, and the giant planets only a few hours.¹¹⁵ The rotational
periods of extrasolar planets are not known, but their proximity to their
stars means that hot Jupiters are tidally locked (their orbits are in sync
with their rotations). This means they only ever show one face to their
stars, with one side in perpetual day, the other in perpetual night.¹¹⁶

Orbital clearing

Main article: Clearing the neighbourhood

The defining dynamic characteristic of a planet is that it has cleared its
neighborhood. A planet that has cleared its neighborhood has accumulated
enough mass to gather up or sweep away all the planetesimals in its orbit.
In effect, it orbits its star in isolation, as opposed to sharing its orbit
with a multitude of similar-sized objects. This characteristic was mandated
as part of the IAU's official definition of a planet in August, 2006. This
criterion excludes such planetary bodies as Pluto, Eris and Ceres from
full-fledged planethood, making them instead dwarf planets.² Although to
date this criterion only applies to the Solar System, a number of young
extrasolar systems have been found in which evidence suggests orbital
clearing is taking place within their circumstellar discs.¹¹⁷

Physical characteristics

Mass

Main article: Planetary mass

A planet's defining physical characteristic is that it is massive enough
for the force of its own gravity to dominate over the electromagnetic
forces binding its physical structure, leading to a state of hydrostatic
equilibrium. This effectively means that all planets are spherical or
spheroidal. Up to a certain mass, an object can be irregular in shape, but
beyond that point, which varies depending on the chemical makeup of the
object, gravity begins to pull an object towards its own centre of mass
until the object collapses into a sphere.¹¹⁸

Mass is also the prime attribute by which planets are distinguished from
stars. The upper mass limit for planethood is roughly 13 times Jupiter's
mass for objects with solar-type isotopic abundance, beyond which it
achieves conditions suitable for nuclear fusion. Other than the Sun, no
objects of such mass exist in the Solar System; but there are exoplanets of
this size. The 13-Jupiter-mass limit is not universally agreed upon and the
Extrasolar Planets Encyclopaedia includes objects up to 20 Jupiter
masses,¹¹⁹ and the Exoplanet Data Explorer up to 24 Jupiter masses.¹²⁰

The smallest known planet is PSR B1257+12A, one of the first extrasolar
planets discovered, which was found in 1992 in orbit around a pulsar. Its
mass is roughly half that of the planet Mercury.⁴ The smallest known planet
orbiting a main-sequence star other than the Sun is Kepler-37b, with a mass
(and radius) slightly higher than that of the Moon.

Internal differentiation

Main article: Planetary differentiation

Every planet began its existence in an entirely fluid state; in early
formation, the denser, heavier materials sank to the centre, leaving the
lighter materials near the surface. Each therefore has a differentiated
interior consisting of a dense planetary core surrounded by a mantle that
either is or was a fluid. The terrestrial planets are sealed within hard
crusts,¹²¹ but in the giant planets the mantle simply blends into the upper
cloud layers. The terrestrial planets have cores of elements such as iron
and nickel, and mantles of silicates. Jupiter and Saturn are believed to
have cores of rock and metal surrounded by mantles of metallic hydrogen.¹²²
Uranus and Neptune, which are smaller, have rocky cores surrounded by
mantles of water, ammonia, methane and other ices.¹²³ The fluid action
within these planets' cores creates a geodynamo that generates a magnetic
field.¹²¹

Atmosphere

Main articles: Atmosphere and Extraterrestrial atmospheres
See also: Extraterrestrial skies

All of the Solar System planets except Mercury¹²⁴ have substantial
atmospheres because their gravity is strong enough to keep gases close to
the surface. The larger giant planets are massive enough to keep large
amounts of the light gases hydrogen and helium, whereas the smaller planets
lose these gases into space.¹²⁵ The composition of Earth's atmosphere is
different from the other planets because the various life processes that
have transpired on the planet have introduced free molecular oxygen.¹²⁶

Planetary atmospheres are affected by the varying insolation or internal
energy, leading to the formation of dynamic weather systems such as
hurricanes, (on Earth), planet-wide dust storms (on Mars), an Earth-sized
anticyclone on Jupiter (called the Great Red Spot), and holes in the
atmosphere (on Neptune).¹⁰⁹ At least one extrasolar planet, HD 189733 b,
has been claimed to have such a weather system, similar to the Great Red
Spot but twice as large.¹²⁷

Hot Jupiters, due to their extreme proximities to their host stars, have
been shown to be losing their atmospheres into space due to stellar
radiation, much like the tails of comets.¹²⁸ ¹²⁹ These planets may have
vast differences in temperature between their day and night sides that
produce supersonic winds,¹³⁰ although the day and night sides of HD 189733
b appear to have very similar temperatures, indicating that that planet's
atmosphere effectively redistributes the star's energy around the
planet.¹²⁷

Magnetosphere

Main article: Magnetosphere

One important characteristic of the planets is their intrinsic magnetic
moments, which in turn give rise to magnetospheres. The presence of a
magnetic field indicates that the planet is still geologically alive. In
other words, magnetized planets have flows of electrically conducting
material in their interiors, which generate their magnetic fields. These
fields significantly change the interaction of the planet and solar wind. A
magnetized planet creates a cavity in the solar wind around itself called
magnetosphere, which the wind cannot penetrate. The magnetosphere can be
much larger than the planet itself. In contrast, non-magnetized planets
have only small magnetospheres induced by interaction of the ionosphere
with the solar wind, which cannot effectively protect the planet.¹³¹

Of the eight planets in the Solar System, only Venus and Mars lack such a
magnetic field.¹³¹ In addition, the moon of Jupiter Ganymede also has one.
Of the magnetized planets the magnetic field of Mercury is the weakest, and
is barely able to deflect the solar wind. Ganymede's magnetic field is
several times larger, and Jupiter's is the strongest in the Solar System
(so strong in fact that it poses a serious health risk to future manned
missions to its moons). The magnetic fields of the other giant planets are
roughly similar in strength to that of Earth, but their magnetic moments
are significantly larger. The magnetic fields of Uranus and Neptune are
strongly tilted relative the rotational axis and displaced from the centre
of the planet.¹³¹

In 2004, a team of astronomers in Hawaii observed an extrasolar planet
around the star HD 179949, which appeared to be creating a sunspot on the
surface of its parent star. The team hypothesized that the planet's
magnetosphere was transferring energy onto the star's surface, increasing
its already high 7,760 °C temperature by an additional 400 °C.¹³²

Secondary characteristics

Main articles: Natural satellite and Planetary ring

Several planets or dwarf planets in the Solar System (such as Neptune and
Pluto) have orbital periods that are in resonance with each other or with
smaller bodies (this is also common in satellite systems). All except
Mercury and Venus have natural satellites, often called "moons". Earth has
one, Mars has two, and the giant planets have numerous moons in complex
planetary-type systems. Many moons of the giant planets have features
similar to those on the terrestrial planets and dwarf planets, and some
have been studied as possible abodes of life (especially Europa).¹³³ ¹³⁴
¹³⁵

The four giant planets are also orbited by planetary rings of varying size
and complexity. The rings are composed primarily of dust or particulate
matter, but can host tiny 'moonlets' whose gravity shapes and maintains
their structure. Although the origins of planetary rings is not precisely
known, they are believed to be the result of natural satellites that fell
below their parent planet's Roche limit and were torn apart by tidal
forces.¹³⁶ ¹³⁷

No secondary characteristics have been observed around extrasolar planets.
The sub-brown dwarf Cha 110913-773444, which has been described as a rogue
planet, is believed to be orbited by a tiny protoplanetary disc⁹⁴ and the
sub-brown dwarf OTS 44 was shown to be surrounded by a substantial
protoplanetary disk of at least 10 Earth masses.⁹⁶

Notes

[1] This definition is drawn from two separate IAU declarations; a formal
  definition agreed by the IAU in 2006, and an informal working definition
  established by the IAU in 2001/2003 for objects outside of the Solar
  System. The official 2006 definition applies only to the Solar System,
  whereas the 2003 definition applies to planets around other stars. The
  extrasolar planet issue was deemed too complex to resolve at the 2006 IAU
  conference.
[2] For the purpose of this 1 in 5 statistic, "Sun-like" means G-type star.
  Data for Sun-like stars wasn't available so this statistic is an
  extrapolation from data about K-type stars
[3] For the purpose of this 1 in 5 statistic, Earth-sized means 1–2 Earth
  radii
[4] For the purpose of this 1 in 5 statistic, "habitable zone" means the
  region with 0.25 to 4 times Earth's stellar flux (corresponding to 0.5–2
  AU for the Sun).

Plasma (physics)

For other uses, see Plasma.

Plasma (from Greek πλάσμα, "anything formed"¹ ) is one of the four
fundamental states of matter, the others being solid, liquid, and gas. A
plasma has properties unlike those of the other states.

A plasma can be created by heating a gas or subjecting it to a strong
electromagnetic field applied with a laser or microwave generator. This
decreases or increases the number of electrons, creating positive or
negative charged particles called ions,² and is accompanied by the
dissociation of molecular bonds, if present.³

The presence of a significant number of charge carriers makes plasma
electrically conductive so that it responds strongly to electromagnetic
fields. Like gas, plasma does not have a definite shape or a definite
volume unless enclosed in a container. Unlike gas, under the influence of a
magnetic field, it may form structures such as filaments, beams and double
layers.

Plasma is the most abundant form of ordinary matter in the Universe (the
only matter known to exist for sure, the more abundant dark matter is
hypothetical and may or may not be explained by ordinary matter), most of
which is in the rarefied intergalactic regions, particularly the
intracluster medium, and in stars, including the Sun.⁴ ⁵ A common form of
plasmas on Earth is seen in neon signs.

Much of the understanding of plasmas has come from the pursuit of
controlled nuclear fusion and fusion power, for which plasma physics
provides the scientific basis.

Properties and parameters

Definition

Plasma is loosely described as an electrically neutral medium of unbound
positive and negative particles (i.e. the overall charge of a plasma is
roughly zero). It is important to note that although they are unbound,
these particles are not 'free' in the sense of not experiencing forces.
When the charges move, they generate electric currents with magnetic
fields, and as a result, they are affected by each other's fields. This
governs their collective behavior with many degrees of freedom.³ ⁷ A
definition can have three criteria:⁸ ⁹

- The plasma approximation: Charged particles must be close enough together
  that each particle influences many nearby charged particles, rather than
  just interacting with the closest particle (these collective effects are
  a distinguishing feature of a plasma). The plasma approximation is valid
  when the number of charge carriers within the sphere of influence (called
  the Debye sphere whose radius is the Debye screening length) of a
  particular particle is higher than unity to provide collective behavior
  of the charged particles. The average number of particles in the Debye
  sphere is given by the plasma parameter, "Λ" (the Greek uppercase letter
  Lambda).
- Bulk interactions: The Debye screening length (defined above) is short
  compared to the physical size of the plasma. This criterion means that
  interactions in the bulk of the plasma are more important than those at
  its edges, where boundary effects may take place. When this criterion is
  satisfied, the plasma is quasineutral.
- Plasma frequency: The electron plasma frequency (measuring plasma
  oscillations of the electrons) is large compared to the electron-neutral
  collision frequency (measuring frequency of collisions between electrons
  and neutral particles). When this condition is valid, electrostatic
  interactions dominate over the processes of ordinary gas kinetics.

Ranges of parameters

Plasma parameters can take on values varying by many orders of magnitude,
but the properties of plasmas with apparently disparate parameters may be
very similar (see plasma scaling). The following chart considers only
conventional atomic plasmas and not exotic phenomena like quark gluon
plasmas:

Degree of ionization

For plasma to exist, ionization is necessary. The term "plasma density" by
itself usually refers to the "electron density", that is, the number of
free electrons per unit volume. The degree of ionization of a plasma is the
proportion of atoms that have lost or gained electrons, and is controlled
mostly by the temperature. Even a partially ionized gas in which as little
as 1% of the particles are ionized can have the characteristics of a plasma
(i.e., response to magnetic fields and high electrical conductivity). The
degree of ionization, α, is defined as α= \frac{n_i}{n_i + nₙ} , where n_i
is the number density of ions and nₙ is the number density of neutral
atoms. The electron density is related to this by the average charge state
\langle Z\rangle of the ions through n_e = \langle Z\rangle n_i, where nₑ
is the number density of electrons.

Temperatures

See also: Nonthermal plasma

Plasma temperature is commonly measured in kelvins or electronvolts and is,
informally, a measure of the thermal kinetic energy per particle. Very high
temperatures are usually needed to sustain ionization, which is a defining
feature of a plasma. The degree of plasma ionization is determined by the
electron temperature relative to the ionization energy (and more weakly by
the density), in a relationship called the Saha equation. At low
temperatures, ions and electrons tend to recombine into bound
states—atoms¹² —and the plasma will eventually become a gas.

In most cases the electrons are close enough to thermal equilibrium that
their temperature is relatively well-defined, even when there is a
significant deviation from a Maxwellian energy distribution function, for
example, due to UV radiation, energetic particles, or strong electric
fields. Because of the large difference in mass, the electrons come to
thermodynamic equilibrium amongst themselves much faster than they come
into equilibrium with the ions or neutral atoms. For this reason, the ion
temperature may be very different from (usually lower than) the electron
temperature. This is especially common in weakly ionized technological
plasmas, where the ions are often near the ambient temperature.

Thermal vs. nonthermal plasmas

Based on the relative temperatures of the electrons, ions and neutrals,
plasmas are classified as "thermal" or "non-thermal". Thermal plasmas have
electrons and the heavy particles at the same temperature, i.e. they are in
thermal equilibrium with each other. Nonthermal plasmas on the other hand
have the ions and neutrals at a much lower temperature (sometimes room
temperature), whereas electrons are much "hotter" (T_e \gg Tₙ).

A plasma is sometimes referred to as being "hot" if it is nearly fully
ionized, or "cold" if only a small fraction (for example 1%) of the gas
molecules are ionized, but other definitions of the terms "hot plasma" and
"cold plasma" are common. Even in a "cold" plasma, the electron temperature
is still typically several thousand degrees Celsius. Plasmas utilized in
"plasma technology" ("technological plasmas") are usually cold plasmas in
the sense that only a small fraction of the gas molecules are ionized.

Plasma potential

Since plasmas are very good electrical conductors, electric potentials play
an important role. The potential as it exists on average in the space
between charged particles, independent of the question of how it can be
measured, is called the "plasma potential", or the "space potential". If an
electrode is inserted into a plasma, its potential will generally lie
considerably below the plasma potential due to what is termed a Debye
sheath. The good electrical conductivity of plasmas makes their electric
fields very small. This results in the important concept of
"quasineutrality", which says the density of negative charges is
approximately equal to the density of positive charges over large volumes
of the plasma (n_e = \langle Z\rangle n_i), but on the scale of the Debye
length there can be charge imbalance. In the special case that double
layers are formed, the charge separation can extend some tens of Debye
lengths.

The magnitude of the potentials and electric fields must be determined by
means other than simply finding the net charge density. A common example is
to assume that the electrons satisfy the Boltzmann relation:

n_e \propto e^{eΦ/k_BTₑ}.

Differentiating this relation provides a means to calculate the electric
field from the density:

\vec{E} = (k_BT_e/e)(\nabla nₑ/nₑ₎.

It is possible to produce a plasma that is not quasineutral. An electron
beam, for example, has only negative charges. The density of a non-neutral
plasma must generally be very low, or it must be very small, otherwise it
will be dissipated by the repulsive electrostatic force.

In astrophysical plasmas, Debye screening prevents electric fields from
directly affecting the plasma over large distances, i.e., greater than the
Debye length. However, the existence of charged particles causes the plasma
to generate, and be affected by, magnetic fields. This can and does cause
extremely complex behavior, such as the generation of plasma double layers,
an object that separates charge over a few tens of Debye lengths. The
dynamics of plasmas interacting with external and self-generated magnetic
fields are studied in the academic discipline of magnetohydrodynamics.

Magnetization

Plasma with a magnetic field strong enough to influence the motion of the
charged particles is said to be magnetized. A common quantitative criterion
is that a particle on average completes at least one gyration around the
magnetic field before making a collision, i.e., ω_{\mathrm{ce} } /
v_{\mathrm{coll} } > 1, where ω_{\mathrm{ce} } is the "electron
gyrofrequency" and v_{\mathrm{coll} } is the "electron collision rate". It
is often the case that the electrons are magnetized while the ions are not.
Magnetized plasmas are anisotropic, meaning that their properties in the
direction parallel to the magnetic field are different from those
perpendicular to it. While electric fields in plasmas are usually small due
to the high conductivity, the electric field associated with a plasma
moving in a magnetic field is given by E = -v\times B (where E is the
electric field, v is the velocity, and B is the magnetic field), and is not
affected by Debye shielding.¹⁴

Comparison of plasma and gas phases

Plasma is often called the fourth state of matter after solid, liquids and
gases.¹⁵ ¹⁶ It is distinct from these and other lower-energy states of
matter. Although it is closely related to the gas phase in that it also has
no definite form or volume, it differs in a number of ways, including the
following:

Common plasmas

Further information: Astrophysical plasma, Interstellar medium and
Intergalactic space

Plasmas are by far the most common phase of ordinary matter in the
universe, both by mass and by volume.¹⁸ Essentially, all of the visible
light from space comes from stars, which are plasmas with a temperature
such that they radiate strongly at visible wavelengths. Most of the
ordinary (or baryonic) matter in the universe, however, is found in the
intergalactic medium, which is also a plasma, but much hotter, so that it
radiates primarily as X-rays.

In 1937, Hannes Alfvén argued that if plasma pervaded the universe, it
could then carry electric currents capable of generating a galactic
magnetic field.¹⁹ After winning the Nobel Prize, he emphasized that:

  In order to understand the phenomena in a certain plasma region, it is
  necessary to map not only the magnetic but also the electric field and
  the electric currents. Space is filled with a network of currents which
  transfer energy and momentum over large or very large distances. The
  currents often pinch to filamentary or surface currents. The latter are
  likely to give space, as also interstellar and intergalactic space, a
  cellular structure.²⁰

By contrast the current scientific consensus is that about 96% of the total
energy density in the universe is not plasma or any other form of ordinary
matter, but a combination of cold dark matter and dark energy. Our Sun, and
all stars, are made of plasma, much of interstellar space is filled with a
plasma, albeit a very sparse one, and intergalactic space too. Even black
holes, which are not directly visible, are thought to be fuelled by
accreting ionising matter (i.e. plasma),²¹ and they are associated with
astrophysical jets of luminous ejected plasma,²² such as M87's jet that
extends 5,000 light-years.²³

In our solar system, interplanetary space is filled with the plasma of the
Solar Wind that extends from the Sun out to the heliopause. However, the
density of ordinary matter is much higher than average and much higher than
that of either dark matter or dark energy. The planet Jupiter accounts for
most of the non-plasma, only about 0.1% of the mass and 10−15% of the
volume within the orbit of Pluto.

Dust and small grains within a plasma will also pick up a net negative
charge, so that they in turn may act like a very heavy negative ion
component of the plasma (see dusty plasmas).

Complex plasma phenomena

Although the underlying equations governing plasmas are relatively simple,
plasma behavior is extraordinarily varied and subtle: the emergence of
unexpected behavior from a simple model is a typical feature of a complex
system. Such systems lie in some sense on the boundary between ordered and
disordered behavior and cannot typically be described either by simple,
smooth, mathematical functions, or by pure randomness. The spontaneous
formation of interesting spatial features on a wide range of length scales
is one manifestation of plasma complexity. The features are interesting,
for example, because they are very sharp, spatially intermittent (the
distance between features is much larger than the features themselves), or
have a fractal form. Many of these features were first studied in the
laboratory, and have subsequently been recognized throughout the universe.
Examples of complexity and complex structures in plasmas include:

Filamentation

Striations or string-like structures,²⁷ also known as birkeland currents,
are seen in many plasmas, like the plasma ball, the aurora,²⁸ lightning,²⁹
electric arcs, solar flares,³⁰ and supernova remnants.³¹ They are sometimes
associated with larger current densities, and the interaction with the
magnetic field can form a magnetic rope structure.³² High power microwave
breakdown at atmospheric pressure also leads to the formation of
filamentary structures.³³ (See also Plasma pinch)

Filamentation also refers to the self-focusing of a high power laser pulse.
At high powers, the nonlinear part of the index of refraction becomes
important and causes a higher index of refraction in the center of the
laser beam, where the laser is brighter than at the edges, causing a
feedback that focuses the laser even more. The tighter focused laser has a
higher peak brightness (irradiance) that forms a plasma. The plasma has an
index of refraction lower than one, and causes a defocusing of the laser
beam. The interplay of the focusing index of refraction, and the defocusing
plasma makes the formation of a long filament of plasma that can be
micrometers to kilometers in length.³⁴ One interesting aspect of the
filamentation generated plasma is the relatively low ion density due to
defocusing effects of the ionized electrons.³⁵ (See also Filament
propagation)

Shocks or double layers

Plasma properties change rapidly (within a few Debye lengths) across a
two-dimensional sheet in the presence of a (moving) shock or (stationary)
double layer. Double layers involve localized charge separation, which
causes a large potential difference across the layer, but does not generate
an electric field outside the layer. Double layers separate adjacent plasma
regions with different physical characteristics, and are often found in
current carrying plasmas. They accelerate both ions and electrons.

Electric fields and circuits

Quasineutrality of a plasma requires that plasma currents close on
themselves in electric circuits. Such circuits follow Kirchhoff's circuit
laws and possess a resistance and inductance. These circuits must generally
be treated as a strongly coupled system, with the behavior in each plasma
region dependent on the entire circuit. It is this strong coupling between
system elements, together with nonlinearity, which may lead to complex
behavior. Electrical circuits in plasmas store inductive (magnetic) energy,
and should the circuit be disrupted, for example, by a plasma instability,
the inductive energy will be released as plasma heating and acceleration.
This is a common explanation for the heating that takes place in the solar
corona. Electric currents, and in particular, magnetic-field-aligned
electric currents (which are sometimes generically referred to as
"Birkeland currents"), are also observed in the Earth's aurora, and in
plasma filaments.

Cellular structure

Narrow sheets with sharp gradients may separate regions with different
properties such as magnetization, density and temperature, resulting in
cell-like regions. Examples include the magnetosphere, heliosphere, and
heliospheric current sheet. Hannes Alfvén wrote: "From the cosmological
point of view, the most important new space research discovery is probably
the cellular structure of space. As has been seen in every region of space
accessible to in situ measurements, there are a number of 'cell walls',
sheets of electric currents, which divide space into compartments with
different magnetization, temperature, density, etc."³⁶

Critical ionization velocity

The critical ionization velocity is the relative velocity between an
ionized plasma and a neutral gas, above which a runaway ionization process
takes place. The critical ionization process is a quite general mechanism
for the conversion of the kinetic energy of a rapidly streaming gas into
ionization and plasma thermal energy. Critical phenomena in general are
typical of complex systems, and may lead to sharp spatial or temporal
features.

Ultracold plasma

Ultracold plasmas are created in a magneto-optical trap (MOT) by trapping
and cooling neutral atoms, to temperatures of 1 mK or lower, and then using
another laser to ionize the atoms by giving each of the outermost electrons
just enough energy to escape the electrical attraction of its parent ion.

One advantage of ultracold plasmas are their well characterized and tunable
initial conditions, including their size and electron temperature. By
adjusting the wavelength of the ionizing laser, the kinetic energy of the
liberated electrons can be tuned as low as 0.1 K, a limit set by the
frequency bandwidth of the laser pulse. The ions inherit the millikelvin
temperatures of the neutral atoms, but are quickly heated through a process
known as disorder induced heating (DIH). This type of non-equilibrium
ultracold plasma evolves rapidly, and displays many other interesting
phenomena.³⁷

One of the metastable states of a strongly nonideal plasma is Rydberg
matter, which forms upon condensation of excited atoms.

Non-neutral plasma

The strength and range of the electric force and the good conductivity of
plasmas usually ensure that the densities of positive and negative charges
in any sizeable region are equal ("quasineutrality"). A plasma with a
significant excess of charge density, or, in the extreme case, is composed
of a single species, is called a non-neutral plasma. In such a plasma,
electric fields play a dominant role. Examples are charged particle beams,
an electron cloud in a Penning trap and positron plasmas.³⁸

Dusty plasma/grain plasma

A dusty plasma contains tiny charged particles of dust (typically found in
space). The dust particles acquire high charges and interact with each
other. A plasma that contains larger particles is called grain plasma.
Under laboratory conditions, dusty plasmas are also called complex
plasmas.³⁹

Impermeable plasma

Impermeable plasma is a type of thermal plasma which acts like an
impermeable solid with respect to gas or cold plasma and can be physically
pushed. Interaction of cold gas and thermal plasma was briefly studied by a
group led by Hannes Alfvén in 1960s and 1970s for its possible applications
in insulation of fusion plasma from the reactor walls.⁴⁰ However, later it
was found that the external magnetic fields in this configuration could
induce kink instabilities in the plasma and subsequently lead to an
unexpectedly high heat loss to the walls.⁴¹ In 2013, a group of materials
scientists reported that they have successfully generated stable
impermeable plasma with no magnetic confinement using only an
ultrahigh-pressure blanket of cold gas. While spectroscopic data on the
characteristics of plasma were claimed to be difficult to obtain due to the
high pressure, the passive effect of plasma on synthesis of different
nanostructures clearly suggested the effective confinement. They also
showed that upon maintaining the impermeability for a few tens of seconds,
screening of ions at the plasma-gas interface could give rise to a strong
secondary mode of heating (known as viscous heating) leading to different
kinetics of reactions and formation of complex nanomaterials.⁴²

Mathematical descriptions

Main article: Plasma modeling

To completely describe the state of a plasma, we would need to write down
all the particle locations and velocities and describe the electromagnetic
field in the plasma region. However, it is generally not practical or
necessary to keep track of all the particles in a plasma. Therefore, plasma
physicists commonly use less detailed descriptions, of which there are two
main types:

Fluid model

Fluid models describe plasmas in terms of smoothed quantities, like density
and averaged velocity around each position (see Plasma parameters). One
simple fluid model, magnetohydrodynamics, treats the plasma as a single
fluid governed by a combination of Maxwell's equations and the
Navier–Stokes equations. A more general description is the two-fluid plasma
picture, where the ions and electrons are described separately. Fluid
models are often accurate when collisionality is sufficiently high to keep
the plasma velocity distribution close to a Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution.
Because fluid models usually describe the plasma in terms of a single flow
at a certain temperature at each spatial location, they can neither capture
velocity space structures like beams or double layers, nor resolve
wave-particle effects.

Kinetic model

Kinetic models describe the particle velocity distribution function at each
point in the plasma and therefore do not need to assume a Maxwell–Boltzmann
distribution. A kinetic description is often necessary for collisionless
plasmas. There are two common approaches to kinetic description of a
plasma. One is based on representing the smoothed distribution function on
a grid in velocity and position. The other, known as the particle-in-cell
(PIC) technique, includes kinetic information by following the trajectories
of a large number of individual particles. Kinetic models are generally
more computationally intensive than fluid models. The Vlasov equation may
be used to describe the dynamics of a system of charged particles
interacting with an electromagnetic field. In magnetized plasmas, a
gyrokinetic approach can substantially reduce the computational expense of
a fully kinetic simulation.

Artificial plasmas

Most artificial plasmas are generated by the application of electric and/or
magnetic fields. Plasma generated in a laboratory setting and for
industrial use can be generally categorized by:

- The type of power source used to generate the plasma—DC, RF and microwave
- The pressure they operate at—vacuum pressure (< 10 mTorr or 1 Pa),
  moderate pressure (~ 1 Torr or 100 Pa), atmospheric pressure (760 Torr or
  100 kPa)
- The degree of ionization within the plasma—fully, partially, or weakly
  ionized
- The temperature relationships within the plasma—thermal plasma (Tₑ ₌ T_i
  = T_{gas}), non-thermal or "cold" plasma (T_e \gg T_i = T_{gas})
- The electrode configuration used to generate the plasma
- The magnetization of the particles within the plasma—magnetized (both ion
  and electrons are trapped in Larmor orbits by the magnetic field),
  partially magnetized (the electrons but not the ions are trapped by the
  magnetic field), non-magnetized (the magnetic field is too weak to trap
  the particles in orbits but may generate Lorentz forces)
- The application.

Generation of artificial plasma

Just like the many uses of plasma, there are several means for its
generation, however, one principle is common to all of them: there must be
energy input to produce and sustain it.⁴⁴ For this case, plasma is
generated when an electric current is applied across a dielectric gas or
fluid (an electrically non-conducting material) as can be seen in the image
to the right, which shows a discharge tube as a simple example (DC used for
simplicity).

The potential difference and subsequent electric field pull the bound
electrons (negative) toward the anode (positive electrode) while the
cathode (negative electrode) pulls the nucleus.⁴⁵ As the voltage increases,
the current stresses the material (by electric polarization) beyond its
dielectric limit (termed strength) into a stage of electrical breakdown,
marked by an electric spark, where the material transforms from being an
insulator into a conductor (as it becomes increasingly ionized). The
underlying process is the Townsend avalanche, where collisions between
electrons and neutral gas atoms create more ions and electrons (as can be
seen in the figure on the right). The first impact of an electron on an
atom results in one ion and two electrons. Therefore, the number of charged
particles increases rapidly (in the millions) only "after about 20
successive sets of collisions",⁴⁶ mainly due to a small mean free path
(average distance travelled between collisions).

Electric arc

With ample current density and ionization, this forms a luminous electric
arc (a continuous electric discharge similar to lightning) between the
electrodes.[Note 1] Electrical resistance along the continuous electric arc
creates heat, which dissociates more gas molecules and ionizes the
resulting atoms (where degree of ionization is determined by temperature),
and as per the sequence: solid-liquid-gas-plasma, the gas is gradually
turned into a thermal plasma.[Note 2] A thermal plasma is in thermal
equilibrium, which is to say that the temperature is relatively homogeneous
throughout the heavy particles (i.e. atoms, molecules and ions) and
electrons. This is so because when thermal plasmas are generated,
electrical energy is given to electrons, which, due to their great mobility
and large numbers, are able to disperse it rapidly and by elastic collision
(without energy loss) to the heavy particles.⁴⁷ [Note 3]

Examples of industrial/commercial plasma

Because of their sizable temperature and density ranges, plasmas find
applications in many fields of research, technology and industry. For
example, in: industrial and extractive metallurgy,⁴⁷ surface treatments
such as plasma spraying (coating), etching in microelectronics,⁴⁸ metal
cutting⁴⁹ and welding; as well as in everyday vehicle exhaust cleanup and
fluorescent/luminescent lamps,⁴⁴ while even playing a part in supersonic
combustion engines for aerospace engineering.⁵⁰

Low-pressure discharges

- Glow discharge plasmas: non-thermal plasmas generated by the application
  of DC or low frequency RF (<100 kHz) electric field to the gap between
  two metal electrodes. Probably the most common plasma; this is the type
  of plasma generated within fluorescent light tubes.⁵¹
- Capacitively coupled plasma (CCP): similar to glow discharge plasmas, but
  generated with high frequency RF electric fields, typically 13.56 MHz.
  These differ from glow discharges in that the sheaths are much less
  intense. These are widely used in the microfabrication and integrated
  circuit manufacturing industries for plasma etching and plasma enhanced
  chemical vapor deposition.⁵²
- Cascaded Arc Plasma Source: a device to produce low temperature (~1eV)
  high density plasmas (HDP).
- Inductively coupled plasma (ICP): similar to a CCP and with similar
  applications but the electrode consists of a coil wrapped around the
  chamber where plasma is formed.⁵³
- Wave heated plasma: similar to CCP and ICP in that it is typically RF (or
  microwave). Examples include helicon discharge and electron cyclotron
  resonance (ECR).⁵⁴

Atmospheric pressure

- Arc discharge: this is a high power thermal discharge of very high
  temperature (~10,000 K). It can be generated using various power
  supplies. It is commonly used in metallurgical processes. For example, it
  is used to smelt minerals containing Al₂O₃ to produce aluminium.
- Corona discharge: this is a non-thermal discharge generated by the
  application of high voltage to sharp electrode tips. It is commonly used
  in ozone generators and particle precipitators.
- Dielectric barrier discharge (DBD): this is a non-thermal discharge
  generated by the application of high voltages across small gaps wherein a
  non-conducting coating prevents the transition of the plasma discharge
  into an arc. It is often mislabeled 'Corona' discharge in industry and
  has similar application to corona discharges. It is also widely used in
  the web treatment of fabrics.⁵⁵ The application of the discharge to
  synthetic fabrics and plastics functionalizes the surface and allows for
  paints, glues and similar materials to adhere.⁵⁶
- Capacitive discharge: this is a nonthermal plasma generated by the
  application of RF power (e.g., 13.56 MHz) to one powered electrode, with
  a grounded electrode held at a small separation distance on the order of
  1 cm. Such discharges are commonly stabilized using a noble gas such as
  helium or argon.⁵⁷
- "Piezoelectric direct discharge plasma:" is a nonthermal plasma generated
  at the high-side of a piezoelectric transformer (PT). This generation
  variant is particularly suited for high efficient and compact devices
  where a separate high voltage power supply is not desired.

History

Plasma was first identified in a Crookes tube, and so described by Sir
William Crookes in 1879 (he called it "radiant matter").⁵⁸ The nature of
the Crookes tube "cathode ray" matter was subsequently identified by
British physicist Sir J.J. Thomson in 1897.⁵⁹ The term "plasma" was coined
by Irving Langmuir in 1928,⁶⁰ perhaps because the glowing discharge molds
itself to the shape of the Crookes tube (Gr. πλάσμα – a thing moulded or
formed).⁶¹ Langmuir described his observations as:

  Except near the electrodes, where there are sheaths containing very few
  electrons, the ionized gas contains ions and electrons in about equal
  numbers so that the resultant space charge is very small. We shall use
  the name plasma to describe this region containing balanced charges of
  ions and electrons.⁶⁰

Notes

[1] The material undergoes various 'regimes' or stages (e.g. saturation,
  breakdown, glow, transition and thermal arc) as the voltage is increased
  under the voltage-current relationship. The voltage rises to its maximum
  value in the saturation stage, and thereafter it undergoes fluctuations
  of the various stages; while the current progressively increases
  throughout.⁴⁶
[2] Across literature, there appears to be no strict definition on where
  the boundary is between a gas and plasma. Nevertheless, it is enough to
  say that at 2,000°C the gas molecules become atomized, and ionized at
  3,000 °C and "in this state, [the] gas has a liquid like viscosity at
  atmospheric pressure and the free electric charges confer relatively high
  electrical conductivities that can approach those of metals."⁴⁷
[3] Note that non-thermal, or non-equilibrium plasmas are not as ionized
  and have lower energy densities, and thus the temperature is not
  dispersed evenly among the particles, where some heavy ones remain
  'cold'.

Proton

This article is about the proton as a subatomic particle. For other uses,
see Proton (disambiguation).

The proton is an elementary subatomic particle, symbol p or p+, with a
positive electric charge of +1e elementary charge and mass slightly less
than that of a neutron. Protons and neutrons, each with mass approximately
one atomic mass unit, are collectively referred to as "nucleons". One or
more protons are present in the nucleus of an atom. The number of protons
in the nucleus is referred to as its atomic number. Since each element has
a unique number of protons, each element has its own unique atomic number.
The word proton is Greek for "first", and this name was given to the
hydrogen nucleus by Ernest Rutherford in 1920. In previous years Rutherford
had discovered that the hydrogen nucleus (known to be the lightest nucleus)
could be extracted from the nuclei of nitrogen by collision. The proton was
therefore a candidate to be a fundamental particle and a building block of
nitrogen and all other heavier atomic nuclei.

In the modern Standard Model of particle physics, the proton is a hadron,
and like the neutron, the other nucleon (particle present in atomic
nuclei), is composed of three quarks. Although the proton was originally
considered a fundamental particle, it is composed of three valence quarks:
two up quarks and one down quark. The rest masses of the quarks contribute
only about 1% of the proton's mass, however.² The remainder of the proton
mass is due to the kinetic energy of the quarks and to the energy of the
gluon fields that bind the quarks together. Because the proton is not a
fundamental particle, it possesses a physical size; the radius of the
proton is about 0.84–0.87 fm.³

At sufficiently low temperatures, free protons will bind to electrons.
However, the character of such bound protons does not change, and they
remain protons. A fast proton moving through matter will slow by
interactions with electrons and nuclei, until it is captured by the
electron cloud of an atom. The result is a protonated atom, which is a
chemical compound of hydrogen. In vacuum, when free electrons are present,
a sufficiently slow proton may pick up a single free electron, becoming a
neutral hydrogen atom, which is chemically a free radical. Such "free
hydrogen atoms" tend to react chemically with many other types of atoms at
sufficiently low energies. When free hydrogen atoms react with each other,
they form neutral hydrogen molecules (H₂), which are the most common
molecular component of molecular clouds in interstellar space. Such
molecules of hydrogen on Earth may then serve (among many other uses) as a
convenient source of protons for accelerators (as used in proton therapy)
and other hadron particle physics experiments that require protons to
accelerate, with the most powerful and noted example being the Large Hadron
Collider.

Description

Protons are spin-½ fermions and are composed of three valence quarks,⁴
making them baryons (a sub-type of hadrons). The two up quarks and one down
quark of the proton are held together by the strong force, mediated by
gluons.⁵ :21–22A modern perspective has the proton composed of the valence
quarks (up, up, down), the gluons, and transitory pairs of sea quarks. The
proton has an approximately exponentially decaying positive charge
distribution with a mean square radius of about 0.8 fm.⁶

Protons and neutrons are both nucleons, which may be bound together by the
nuclear force to form atomic nuclei. The nucleus of the most common isotope
of the hydrogen atom (with the chemical symbol "H") is a lone proton. The
nuclei of the heavy hydrogen isotopes deuterium and tritium contain one
proton bound to one and two neutrons, respectively. All other types of
atomic nuclei are composed of two or more protons and various numbers of
neutrons.

History

The concept of a hydrogen-like particle as a constituent of other atoms was
developed over a long period. As early as 1815, William Prout proposed that
all atoms are composed of hydrogen atoms (which he called "protyles"),
based on a simplistic interpretation of early values of atomic weights (see
Prout's hypothesis), which was disproved when more accurate values were
measured.⁷ :39–42

In 1886, Eugen Goldstein discovered canal rays (also known as anode rays)
and showed that they were positively charged particles (ions) produced from
gases. However, since particles from different gases had different values
of charge-to-mass ratio (e/m), they could not be identified with a single
particle, unlike the negative electrons discovered by J. J. Thomson.

Following the discovery of the atomic nucleus by Ernest Rutherford in 1911,
Antonius van den Broek proposed that the place of each element in the
periodic table (its atomic number) is equal to its nuclear charge. This was
confirmed experimentally by Henry Moseley in 1913 using X-ray spectra.

In 1917, (in experiments reported in 1919) Rutherford proved that the
hydrogen nucleus is present in other nuclei, a result usually described as
the discovery of the proton.⁸ Rutherford had earlier learned to produce
hydrogen nuclei as a type of radiation produced as a product of the impact
of alpha particles on nitrogen gas, and recognize them by their unique
penetration signature in air and their appearance in scintillation
detectors. These experiments were begun when Rutherford had noticed that,
when alpha particles were shot into air (mostly nitrogen), his
scintillation detectors showed the signatures of typical hydrogen nuclei as
a product. After experimentation Rutherford traced the reaction to the
nitrogen in air, and found that when alphas were produced into pure
nitrogen gas, the effect was larger. Rutherford determined that this
hydrogen could have come only from the nitrogen, and therefore nitrogen
must contain hydrogen nuclei. One hydrogen nucleus was being knocked off by
the impact of the alpha particle, producing oxygen-17 in the process. This
was the first reported nuclear reaction, ¹⁴N + α → ¹⁷O + p. (This reaction
would later be observed happening directly in a cloud chamber in 1925).

Rutherford knew hydrogen to be the simplest and lightest element and was
influenced by Prout's hypothesis that hydrogen was the building block of
all elements. Discovery that the hydrogen nucleus is present in all other
nuclei as an elementary particle, led Rutherford to give the hydrogen
nucleus a special name as a particle, since he suspected that hydrogen, the
lightest element, contained only one of these particles. He named this new
fundamental building block of the nucleus the proton, after the neuter
singular of the Greek word for "first", πρῶτον. However, Rutherford also
had in mind the word protyle as used by Prout. Rutherford spoke at the
British Association for the Advancement of Science at its Cardiff meeting
beginning 24 August 1920.⁹ Rutherford was asked by Oliver Lodge for a new
name for the positive hydrogen nucleus to avoid confusion with the neutral
hydrogen atom. He initially suggested both proton and prouton (after
Prout).¹⁰ Rutherford later reported that the meeting had accepted his
suggestion that the hydrogen nucleus be named the "proton", following
Prout's word "protyle".¹¹ The first use of the word "proton" in the
scientific literature appeared in 1920.¹²

Stability

Main article: Proton decay

The free proton (a proton not bound to nucleons or electrons) is a stable
particle that has not been observed to break down spontaneously to other
particles. Free protons are found naturally in a number of situations in
which energies or temperatures are high enough to separate them from
electrons, for which they have some affinity. Free protons exist in plasmas
in which temperatures are too high to allow them to combine with electrons.
Free protons of high energy and velocity make up 90% of cosmic rays, which
propagate in vacuum for interstellar distances. Free protons are emitted
directly from atomic nuclei in some rare types of radioactive decay.
Protons also result (along with electrons and antineutrinos) from the
radioactive decay of free neutrons, which are unstable.

The spontaneous decay of free protons has never been observed, and the
proton is therefore considered a stable particle. However, some grand
unified theories of particle physics predict that proton decay should take
place with lifetimes of the order of 10³⁶ years, and experimental searches
have established lower bounds on the mean lifetime of the proton for
various assumed decay products.¹³ ¹⁴ ¹⁵

Experiments at the Super-Kamiokande detector in Japan gave lower limits for
proton mean lifetime of 6.6×10³³ years for decay to an antimuon and a
neutral pion, and 8.2×10³³ years for decay to a positron and a neutral
pion.¹⁶ Another experiment at the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory in Canada
searched for gamma rays resulting from residual nuclei resulting from the
decay of a proton from oxygen-16. This experiment was designed to detect
decay to any product, and established a lower limit to the proton lifetime
of 2.1×10²⁹ years.¹⁷

However, protons are known to transform into neutrons through the process
of electron capture (also called inverse beta decay). For free protons,
this process does not occur spontaneously but only when energy is supplied.
The equation is:

  p+ + e− → n + ν
  e

The process is reversible; neutrons can convert back to protons through
beta decay, a common form of radioactive decay. In fact, a free neutron
decays this way, with a mean lifetime of about 15 minutes.

Quarks and the mass of the proton

In quantum chromodynamics, the modern theory of the nuclear force, most of
the mass of the proton and the neutron is explained by special relativity.
The mass of the proton is about 80–100 times greater than the sum of the
rest masses of the quarks that make it up, while the gluons have zero rest
mass. The extra energy of the quarks and gluons in a region within a
proton, as compared to the rest energy of the quarks alone in the QCD
vacuum, accounts for almost 99% of the mass. The rest mass of the proton
is, thus, the invariant mass of the system of moving quarks and gluons that
make up the particle, and, in such systems, even the energy of massless
particles is still measured as part of the rest mass of the system.

Two terms are used in referring to the mass of the quarks that make up
protons: current quark mass refers to the mass of a quark by itself, while
constituent quark mass refers to the current quark mass plus the mass of
the gluon particle field surrounding the quark.¹⁸ :285–286 ¹⁹ :150–151
These masses typically have very different values. As noted, most of a
proton's mass comes from the gluons that bind the current quarks together,
rather than from the quarks themselves. While gluons are inherently
massless, they possess energy—to be more specific, quantum chromodynamics
binding energy (QCBE)—and it is this that contributes so greatly to the
overall mass of the proton (see mass in special relativity). A proton has a
mass of approximately 938 MeV/c², of which the rest mass of its three
valence quarks contributes only about 9.4 MeV/c²; much of the remainder can
be attributed to the gluons' QCBE.²⁰ ²¹ ²²

The internal dynamics of the proton are complicated, because they are
determined by the quarks' exchanging gluons, and interacting with various
vacuum condensates. Lattice QCD provides a way of calculating the mass of
the proton directly from the theory to any accuracy, in principle. The most
recent calculations²³ ²⁴ claim that the mass is determined to better than
4% accuracy, even to 1% accuracy (see Figure S5 in Dürr et al.²⁴ ). These
claims are still controversial, because the calculations cannot yet be done
with quarks as light as they are in the real world. This means that the
predictions are found by a process of extrapolation, which can introduce
systematic errors.²⁵ It is hard to tell whether these errors are controlled
properly, because the quantities that are compared to experiment are the
masses of the hadrons, which are known in advance.

These recent calculations are performed by massive supercomputers, and, as
noted by Boffi and Pasquini: "a detailed description of the nucleon
structure is still missing because ... long-distance behavior requires a
nonperturbative and/or numerical treatment..."²⁶ More conceptual approaches
to the structure of the proton are: the topological soliton approach
originally due to Tony Skyrme and the more accurate AdS/QCD approach that
extends it to include a string theory of gluons,²⁷ various QCD-inspired
models like the bag model and the constituent quark model, which were
popular in the 1980s, and the SVZ sum rules, which allow for rough
approximate mass calculations.²⁸ These methods do not have the same
accuracy as the more brute-force lattice QCD methods, at least not yet.

Charge radius

Main article: Charge radius

The internationally accepted value of the proton's charge radius is 0.8768
fm (see orders of magnitude for comparison to other sizes). This value is
based on measurements involving a proton and an electron.

However, since 5 July 2010, an international research team has been able to
make measurements involving an exotic atom made of a proton and a
negatively charged muon. After a long and careful analysis of those
measurements, the team concluded that the root-mean-square charge radius of
a proton is "0.84184(67) fm, which differs by 5.0 standard deviations from
the CODATA value of 0.8768(69) fm".²⁹ In January 2013, an updated value for
the charge radius of a proton—0.84087(39) fm—was published. The precision
was improved by 1.7 times, but the difference with CODATA value persisted
at 7σ significance.³⁰

The international research team that obtained this result at the Paul
Scherrer Institut (PSI) in Villigen (Switzerland) includes scientists from
the Max Planck Institute of Quantum Optics (MPQ) in Garching, the
Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität (LMU) Munich and the Institut für
Strahlwerkzeuge (IFWS) of the Universität Stuttgart (both from Germany),
and the University of Coimbra, Portugal.³¹ ³² They are now attempting to
explain the discrepancy, and re-examining the results of both previous
high-precision measurements and complicated calculations. If no errors are
found in the measurements or calculations, it could be necessary to
re-examine the world's most precise and best-tested fundamental theory:
quantum electrodynamics.³¹ The proton radius remains a puzzle as of early
2015.³³

Interaction of free protons with ordinary matter

Main article: Proton therapy

Although protons have affinity for oppositely charged electrons, free
protons must lose sufficient velocity (and kinetic energy) in order to
become closely associated and bound to electrons, since this is a
relatively low-energy interaction. High energy protons, in traversing
ordinary matter, lose energy by collisions with atomic nuclei, and by
ionization of atoms (removing electrons) until they are slowed sufficiently
to be captured by the electron cloud in a normal atom.

However, in such an association with an electron, the character of the
bound proton is not changed, and it remains a proton. The attraction of
low-energy free protons to any electrons present in normal matter (such as
the electrons in normal atoms) causes free protons to stop and to form a
new chemical bond with an atom. Such a bond happens at any sufficiently
"cold" temperature (i.e., comparable to temperatures at the surface of the
Sun) and with any type of atom. Thus, in interaction with any type of
normal (non-plasma) matter, low-velocity free protons are attracted to
electrons in any atom or molecule with which they come in contact, causing
the proton and molecule to combine. Such molecules are then said to be
"protonated", and chemically they often, as a result, become so-called
Bronsted acids.

Proton in chemistry

Atomic number

In chemistry, the number of protons in the nucleus of an atom is known as
the atomic number, which determines the chemical element to which the atom
belongs. For example, the atomic number of chlorine is 17; this means that
each chlorine atom has 17 protons and that all atoms with 17 protons are
chlorine atoms. The chemical properties of each atom are determined by the
number of (negatively charged) electrons, which for neutral atoms is equal
to the number of (positive) protons so that the total charge is zero. For
example, a neutral chlorine atom has 17 protons and 17 electrons, whereas a
Cl− anion has 17 protons and 18 electrons for a total charge of −1.

All atoms of a given element are not necessarily identical, however, as the
number of neutrons may vary to form different isotopes, and energy levels
may differ forming different nuclear isomers. For example, there are two
stable isotopes of chlorine: 35
17Cl with 35 − 17 = 18 neutrons and 37
17Cl with 37 − 17 = 20 neutrons.

Hydrogen ion

See also: Hydron (chemistry)

In chemistry, the term proton refers to the hydrogen ion, H+
. Since the atomic number of hydrogen is 1, a hydrogen ion has no electrons
and corresponds to a bare nucleus, consisting of a proton (and 0 neutrons
for the most abundant isotope protium 1
1H). The proton is a "bare charge" with only about 1/64,000 of the radius
of a hydrogen atom, and so is extremely reactive chemically. The free
proton, thus, has an extremely short lifetime in chemical systems such as
liquids and it reacts immediately with the electron cloud of any available
molecule. In aqueous solution, it forms the hydronium ion, H₃O⁺, which in
turn is further solvated by water molecules in clusters such as [H₅O₂]⁺ and
[H₉O₄]⁺.³⁴

The transfer of H+
in an acid–base reaction is usually referred to as "proton transfer". The
acid is referred to as a proton donor and the base as a proton acceptor.
Likewise, biochemical terms such as proton pump and proton channel refer to
the movement of hydrated H+
ions.

The ion produced by removing the electron from a deuterium atom is known as
a deuteron, not a proton. Likewise, removing an electron from a tritium
atom produces a triton.

Proton nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)

Also in chemistry, the term "proton NMR" refers to the observation of
hydrogen-1 nuclei in (mostly organic) molecules by nuclear magnetic
resonance. This method uses the spin of the proton, which has the value
one-half. The name refers to examination of protons as they occur in
protium (hydrogen-1 atoms) in compounds, and does not imply that free
protons exist in the compound being studied.

Human exposure

Main article: Effect of spaceflight on the human body

The Apollo Lunar Surface Experiments Packages (ALSEP) determined that more
than 95% of the particles in the solar wind are electrons and protons, in
approximately equal numbers.³⁵ ³⁶

  Because the Solar Wind Spectrometer made continuous measurements, it was
  possible to measure how the Earth's magnetic field affects arriving solar
  wind particles. For about two-thirds of each orbit, the Moon is outside
  of the Earth's magnetic field. At these times, a typical proton density
  was 10 to 20 per cubic centimeter, with most protons having velocities
  between 400 and 650 kilometers per second. For about five days of each
  month, the Moon is inside the Earth's geomagnetic tail, and typically no
  solar wind particles were detectable. For the remainder of each lunar
  orbit, the Moon is in a transitional region known as the magnetosheath,
  where the Earth's magnetic field affects the solar wind but does not
  completely exclude it. In this region, the particle flux is reduced, with
  typical proton velocities of 250 to 450 kilometers per second. During the
  lunar night, the spectrometer was shielded from the solar wind by the
  Moon and no solar wind particles were measured.³⁵

Protons also occur in from extrasolar origin in space, from galactic cosmic
rays, where they make up about 90% of the total particle flux. These
protons often have higher energy than solar wind protons, but their
intensity is far more uniform and less variable than protons coming from
the Sun, the production of which is heavily affected by solar proton events
such as coronal mass ejections.

Research has been performed on the dose-rate effects of protons, as
typically found in space travel, on human health.³⁶ ³⁷ To be more specific,
there are hopes to identify what specific chromosomes are damaged, and to
define the damage, during cancer development from proton exposure.³⁶
Another study looks into determining "the effects of exposure to proton
irradiation on neurochemical and behavioral endpoints, including
dopaminergic functioning, amphetamine-induced conditioned taste aversion
learning, and spatial learning and memory as measured by the Morris water
maze.³⁷ Electrical charging of a spacecraft due to interplanetary proton
bombardment has also been proposed for study.³⁸ There are many more studies
that pertain to space travel, including galactic cosmic rays and their
possible health effects, and solar proton event exposure.

The American Biostack and Soviet Biorack space travel experiments have
demonstrated the severity of molecular damage induced by heavy ions on
micro organisms including Artemia cysts.³⁹

Antiproton

Main article: Antiproton

CPT-symmetry puts strong constraints on the relative properties of
particles and antiparticles and, therefore, is open to stringent tests. For
example, the charges of the proton and antiproton must sum to exactly zero.
This equality has been tested to one part in 10⁸. The equality of their
masses has also been tested to better than one part in 10⁸. By holding
antiprotons in a Penning trap, the equality of the charge to mass ratio of
the proton and the antiproton has been tested to one part in 6×10⁹.⁴⁰ The
magnetic moment of the antiproton has been measured with error of 8×10−3
nuclear Bohr magnetons, and is found to be equal and opposite to that of
the proton.

Quantum mechanics

For a more accessible and less technical introduction to this topic, see
Introduction to quantum mechanics.

Quantum mechanics (QM; also known as quantum physics, or quantum theory),
including quantum field theory, is a fundamental branch of physics
concerned with processes involving, for example, atoms and photons. In such
processes, said to be quantized, the action has been observed to be only in
integer multiples of the Planck constant, a physical quantity that is
exceedingly, indeed perhaps ultimately, small. This is utterly inexplicable
in classical physics.

Quantum mechanics gradually arose from Max Planck's solution in 1900 to the
black-body radiation problem (reported 1859) and Albert Einstein's 1905
paper which offered a quantum-based theory to explain the photoelectric
effect (reported 1887). Early quantum theory was significantly reformulated
in the mid-1920s.

The mathematical formulations of quantum mechanics are abstract. A
mathematical function, the wave function, provides information about the
probability amplitude of position, momentum, and other physical properties
of a particle.

Important applications of quantum mechanical theory include superconducting
magnets, LEDs and the laser, the transistor and semiconductors such as the
microprocessor, medical and research imaging such as MRI and electron
microscopy, and explanations for many biological and physical phenomena.

History

Main article: History of quantum mechanics

Scientific inquiry into the wave nature of light began in the 17th and 18th
centuries, when scientists such as Robert Hooke, Christiaan Huygens and
Leonhard Euler proposed a wave theory of light based on experimental
observations.¹ In 1803, Thomas Young, an English polymath, performed the
famous double-slit experiment that he later described in a paper entitled
On the nature of light and colours. This experiment played a major role in
the general acceptance of the wave theory of light.

In 1838, Michael Faraday discovered cathode rays. These studies were
followed by the 1859 statement of the black-body radiation problem by
Gustav Kirchhoff, the 1877 suggestion by Ludwig Boltzmann that the energy
states of a physical system can be discrete, and the 1900 quantum
hypothesis of Max Planck.² Planck's hypothesis that energy is radiated and
absorbed in discrete "quanta" (or energy elements) precisely matched the
observed patterns of black-body radiation.

In 1896, Wilhelm Wien empirically determined a distribution law of
black-body radiation,³ known as Wien's law in his honor. Ludwig Boltzmann
independently arrived at this result by considerations of Maxwell's
equations. However, it was valid only at high frequencies and
underestimated the radiance at low frequencies. Later, Planck corrected
this model using Boltzmann's statistical interpretation of thermodynamics
and proposed what is now called Planck's law, which led to the development
of quantum mechanics.

Following Max Planck's solution in 1900 to the black-body radiation problem
(reported 1859), Albert Einstein offered a quantum-based theory to explain
the photoelectric effect (1905, reported 1887). Around 1900-1910, the
atomic theory and the corpuscular theory of light⁴ first came to be widely
accepted as scientific fact; these latter theories can be viewed as quantum
theories of matter and electromagnetic radiation, respectively.

Among the first to study quantum phenomena in nature were Arthur Compton,
C.V. Raman, and Pieter Zeeman, each of whom has a quantum effect named
after him. Robert A. Millikan studied the photoelectric effect
experimentally, and Albert Einstein developed a theory for it. At the same
time, Niels Bohr developed his theory of the atomic structure, which was
later confirmed by the experiments of Henry Moseley. In 1913, Peter Debye
extended Niels Bohr's theory of atomic structure, introducing elliptical
orbits, a concept also introduced by Arnold Sommerfeld.⁵ This phase is
known as old quantum theory.

According to Planck, each energy element (E) is proportional to its
frequency (ν):

E = h ν

where h is Planck's constant.

Planck cautiously insisted that this was simply an aspect of the processes
of absorption and emission of radiation and had nothing to do with the
physical reality of the radiation itself.⁶ In fact, he considered his
quantum hypothesis a mathematical trick to get the right answer rather than
a sizable discovery.⁷ However, in 1905 Albert Einstein interpreted Planck's
quantum hypothesis realistically and used it to explain the photoelectric
effect, in which shining light on certain materials can eject electrons
from the material. He won the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics for this work.

Einstein further developed this idea to show that an electromagnetic wave
such as light could also be described as a particle (later called the
photon), with a discrete quantum of energy that was dependent on its
frequency.⁸

The foundations of quantum mechanics were established during the first half
of the 20th century by Max Planck, Niels Bohr, Werner Heisenberg, Louis de
Broglie, Arthur Compton, Albert Einstein, Erwin Schrödinger, Max Born, John
von Neumann, Paul Dirac, Enrico Fermi, Wolfgang Pauli, Max von Laue,
Freeman Dyson, David Hilbert, Wilhelm Wien, Satyendra Nath Bose, Arnold
Sommerfeld, and others. The Copenhagen interpretation of Niels Bohr became
widely accepted.

In the mid-1920s, developments in quantum mechanics led to its becoming the
standard formulation for atomic physics. In the summer of 1925, Bohr and
Heisenberg published results that closed the old quantum theory. Out of
deference to their particle-like behavior in certain processes and
measurements, light quanta came to be called photons (1926). From
Einstein's simple postulation was born a flurry of debating, theorizing,
and testing. Thus, the entire field of quantum physics emerged, leading to
its wider acceptance at the Fifth Solvay Conference in 1927.

It was found that subatomic particles and electromagnetic waves are neither
simply particle nor wave but have certain properties of each. This
originated the concept of wave–particle duality.

By 1930, quantum mechanics had been further unified and formalized by the
work of David Hilbert, Paul Dirac and John von Neumann⁹ with greater
emphasis on measurement, the statistical nature of our knowledge of
reality, and philosophical speculation about the 'observer'. It has since
permeated many disciplines including quantum chemistry, quantum
electronics, quantum optics, and quantum information science. Its
speculative modern developments include string theory and quantum gravity
theories. It also provides a useful framework for many features of the
modern periodic table of elements, and describes the behaviors of atoms
during chemical bonding and the flow of electrons in computer
semiconductors, and therefore plays a crucial role in many modern
technologies.

While quantum mechanics traditionally described the world of the very
small, it is also needed to explain certain recently investigated
macroscopic systems such as superconductors, superfluids, and large organic
molecules.¹⁰

The word quantum derives from the Latin, meaning "how great" or "how
much".¹¹ In quantum mechanics, it refers to a discrete unit assigned to
certain physical quantities such as the energy of an atom at rest (see
Figure 1). The discovery that particles are discrete packets of energy with
wave-like properties led to the branch of physics dealing with atomic and
subatomic systems which is today called quantum mechanics. It underlies the
mathematical framework of many fields of physics and chemistry, including
condensed matter physics, solid-state physics, atomic physics, molecular
physics, computational physics, computational chemistry, quantum chemistry,
particle physics, nuclear chemistry, and nuclear physics.¹² Some
fundamental aspects of the theory are still actively studied.¹³

Quantum mechanics is essential to understanding the behavior of systems at
atomic length scales and smaller. If the physical nature of an atom was
solely described by classical mechanics, electrons would not orbit the
nucleus, since orbiting electrons emit radiation (due to circular motion)
and would eventually collide with the nucleus due to this loss of energy.
This framework was unable to explain the stability of atoms. Instead,
electrons remain in an uncertain, non-deterministic, smeared, probabilistic
wave–particle orbital about the nucleus, defying the traditional
assumptions of classical mechanics and electromagnetism.¹⁴

Quantum mechanics was initially developed to provide a better explanation
and description of the atom, especially the differences in the spectra of
light emitted by different isotopes of the same chemical element, as well
as subatomic particles. In short, the quantum-mechanical atomic model has
succeeded spectacularly in the realm where classical mechanics and
electromagnetism falter.

Broadly speaking, quantum mechanics incorporates four classes of phenomena
for which classical physics cannot account:

- quantization of certain physical properties
- wave–particle duality
- principle of uncertainty
- quantum entanglement

Mathematical formulations

Main article: Mathematical formulations of quantum mechanics
See also: Quantum logic

In the mathematically rigorous formulation of quantum mechanics developed
by Paul Dirac,¹⁵ David Hilbert,¹⁶ John von Neumann,¹⁷ and Hermann Weyl,¹⁸
the possible states of a quantum mechanical system are represented by unit
vectors (called state vectors). Formally, these reside in a complex
separable Hilbert space—variously called the state space or the associated
Hilbert space of the system—that is well defined up to a complex number of
norm 1 (the phase factor). In other words, the possible states are points
in the projective space of a Hilbert space, usually called the complex
projective space. The exact nature of this Hilbert space is dependent on
the system—for example, the state space for position and momentum states is
the space of square-integrable functions, while the state space for the
spin of a single proton is just the product of two complex planes. Each
observable is represented by a maximally Hermitian (precisely: by a
self-adjoint) linear operator acting on the state space. Each eigenstate of
an observable corresponds to an eigenvector of the operator, and the
associated eigenvalue corresponds to the value of the observable in that
eigenstate. If the operator's spectrum is discrete, the observable can
attain only those discrete eigenvalues.

In the formalism of quantum mechanics, the state of a system at a given
time is described by a complex wave function, also referred to as state
vector in a complex vector space.¹⁹ This abstract mathematical object
allows for the calculation of probabilities of outcomes of concrete
experiments. For example, it allows one to compute the probability of
finding an electron in a particular region around the nucleus at a
particular time. Contrary to classical mechanics, one can never make
simultaneous predictions of conjugate variables, such as position and
momentum, with accuracy. For instance, electrons may be considered (to a
certain probability) to be located somewhere within a given region of
space, but with their exact positions unknown. Contours of constant
probability, often referred to as "clouds", may be drawn around the nucleus
of an atom to conceptualize where the electron might be located with the
most probability. Heisenberg's uncertainty principle quantifies the
inability to precisely locate the particle given its conjugate momentum.²⁰

According to one interpretation, as the result of a measurement the wave
function containing the probability information for a system collapses from
a given initial state to a particular eigenstate. The possible results of a
measurement are the eigenvalues of the operator representing the
observable—which explains the choice of Hermitian operators, for which all
the eigenvalues are real. The probability distribution of an observable in
a given state can be found by computing the spectral decomposition of the
corresponding operator. Heisenberg's uncertainty principle is represented
by the statement that the operators corresponding to certain observables do
not commute.

The probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics thus stems from the act of
measurement. This is one of the most difficult aspects of quantum systems
to understand. It was the central topic in the famous Bohr-Einstein
debates, in which the two scientists attempted to clarify these fundamental
principles by way of thought experiments. In the decades after the
formulation of quantum mechanics, the question of what constitutes a
"measurement" has been extensively studied. Newer interpretations of
quantum mechanics have been formulated that do away with the concept of
"wavefunction collapse" (see, for example, the relative state
interpretation). The basic idea is that when a quantum system interacts
with a measuring apparatus, their respective wavefunctions become
entangled, so that the original quantum system ceases to exist as an
independent entity. For details, see the article on measurement in quantum
mechanics.²¹

Generally, quantum mechanics does not assign definite values. Instead, it
makes a prediction using a probability distribution; that is, it describes
the probability of obtaining the possible outcomes from measuring an
observable. Often these results are skewed by many causes, such as dense
probability clouds. Probability clouds are approximate (but better than the
Bohr model) whereby electron location is given by a probability function,
the wave function eigenvalue, such that the probability is the squared
modulus of the complex amplitude, or quantum state nuclear attraction.²² ²³
Naturally, these probabilities will depend on the quantum state at the
"instant" of the measurement. Hence, uncertainty is involved in the value.
There are, however, certain states that are associated with a definite
value of a particular observable. These are known as eigenstates of the
observable ("eigen" can be translated from German as meaning "inherent" or
"characteristic").²⁴

In the everyday world, it is natural and intuitive to think of everything
(every observable) as being in an eigenstate. Everything appears to have a
definite position, a definite momentum, a definite energy, and a definite
time of occurrence. However, quantum mechanics does not pinpoint the exact
values of a particle's position and momentum (since they are conjugate
pairs) or its energy and time (since they too are conjugate pairs); rather,
it provides only a range of probabilities in which that particle might be
given its momentum and momentum probability. Therefore, it is helpful to
use different words to describe states having uncertain values and states
having definite values (eigenstates). Usually, a system will not be in an
eigenstate of the observable (particle) we are interested in. However, if
one measures the observable, the wavefunction will instantaneously be an
eigenstate (or "generalized" eigenstate) of that observable. This process
is known as wavefunction collapse, a controversial and much-debated
process²⁵ that involves expanding the system under study to include the
measurement device. If one knows the corresponding wave function at the
instant before the measurement, one will be able to compute the probability
of the wavefunction collapsing into each of the possible eigenstates. For
example, the free particle in the previous example will usually have a
wavefunction that is a wave packet centered around some mean position x₀
(neither an eigenstate of position nor of momentum). When one measures the
position of the particle, it is impossible to predict with certainty the
result.²¹ It is probable, but not certain, that it will be near x₀, where
the amplitude of the wave function is large. After the measurement is
performed, having obtained some result x, the wave function collapses into
a position eigenstate centered at x.²⁶

The time evolution of a quantum state is described by the Schrödinger
equation, in which the Hamiltonian (the operator corresponding to the total
energy of the system) generates the time evolution. The time evolution of
wave functions is deterministic in the sense that - given a wavefunction at
an initial time - it makes a definite prediction of what the wavefunction
will be at any later time.²⁷

During a measurement, on the other hand, the change of the initial
wavefunction into another, later wavefunction is not deterministic, it is
unpredictable (i.e., random). A time-evolution simulation can be seen
here.²⁸ ²⁹

Wave functions change as time progresses. The Schrödinger equation
describes how wavefunctions change in time, playing a role similar to
Newton's second law in classical mechanics. The Schrödinger equation,
applied to the aforementioned example of the free particle, predicts that
the center of a wave packet will move through space at a constant velocity
(like a classical particle with no forces acting on it). However, the wave
packet will also spread out as time progresses, which means that the
position becomes more uncertain with time. This also has the effect of
turning a position eigenstate (which can be thought of as an infinitely
sharp wave packet) into a broadened wave packet that no longer represents a
(definite, certain) position eigenstate.³⁰

Some wave functions produce probability distributions that are constant, or
independent of time—such as when in a stationary state of constant energy,
time vanishes in the absolute square of the wave function. Many systems
that are treated dynamically in classical mechanics are described by such
"static" wave functions. For example, a single electron in an unexcited
atom is pictured classically as a particle moving in a circular trajectory
around the atomic nucleus, whereas in quantum mechanics it is described by
a static, spherically symmetric wavefunction surrounding the nucleus (Fig.
1) (note, however, that only the lowest angular momentum states, labeled s,
are spherically symmetric).³¹

The Schrödinger equation acts on the entire probability amplitude, not
merely its absolute value. Whereas the absolute value of the probability
amplitude encodes information about probabilities, its phase encodes
information about the interference between quantum states. This gives rise
to the "wave-like" behavior of quantum states. As it turns out, analytic
solutions of the Schrödinger equation are available for only a very small
number of relatively simple model Hamiltonians, of which the quantum
harmonic oscillator, the particle in a box, the hydrogen molecular ion, and
the hydrogen atom are the most important representatives. Even the helium
atom—which contains just one more electron than does the hydrogen atom—has
defied all attempts at a fully analytic treatment.

There exist several techniques for generating approximate solutions,
however. In the important method known as perturbation theory, one uses the
analytic result for a simple quantum mechanical model to generate a result
for a more complicated model that is related to the simpler model by (for
one example) the addition of a weak potential energy. Another method is the
"semi-classical equation of motion" approach, which applies to systems for
which quantum mechanics produces only weak (small) deviations from
classical behavior. These deviations can then be computed based on the
classical motion. This approach is particularly important in the field of
quantum chaos.

Mathematically equivalent formulations of quantum mechanics

There are numerous mathematically equivalent formulations of quantum
mechanics. One of the oldest and most commonly used formulations is the
"transformation theory" proposed by Paul Dirac, which unifies and
generalizes the two earliest formulations of quantum mechanics - matrix
mechanics (invented by Werner Heisenberg) and wave mechanics (invented by
Erwin Schrödinger).³²

Especially since Werner Heisenberg was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics
in 1932 for the creation of quantum mechanics, the role of Max Born in the
development of QM was overlooked until the 1954 Nobel award. The role is
noted in a 2005 biography of Born, which recounts his role in the matrix
formulation of quantum mechanics, and the use of probability amplitudes.
Heisenberg himself acknowledges having learned matrices from Born, as
published in a 1940 festschrift honoring Max Planck.³³ In the matrix
formulation, the instantaneous state of a quantum system encodes the
probabilities of its measurable properties, or "observables". Examples of
observables include energy, position, momentum, and angular momentum.
Observables can be either continuous (e.g., the position of a particle) or
discrete (e.g., the energy of an electron bound to a hydrogen atom).³⁴ An
alternative formulation of quantum mechanics is Feynman's path integral
formulation, in which a quantum-mechanical amplitude is considered as a sum
over all possible classical and non-classical paths between the initial and
final states. This is the quantum-mechanical counterpart of the action
principle in classical mechanics.

Interactions with other scientific theories

The rules of quantum mechanics are fundamental. They assert that the state
space of a system is a Hilbert space and that observables of that system
are Hermitian operators acting on that space—although they do not tell us
which Hilbert space or which operators. These can be chosen appropriately
in order to obtain a quantitative description of a quantum system. An
important guide for making these choices is the correspondence principle,
which states that the predictions of quantum mechanics reduce to those of
classical mechanics when a system moves to higher energies or,
equivalently, larger quantum numbers, i.e. whereas a single particle
exhibits a degree of randomness, in systems incorporating millions of
particles averaging takes over and, at the high energy limit, the
statistical probability of random behaviour approaches zero. In other
words, classical mechanics is simply a quantum mechanics of large systems.
This "high energy" limit is known as the classical or correspondence limit.
One can even start from an established classical model of a particular
system, then attempt to guess the underlying quantum model that would give
rise to the classical model in the correspondence limit.

When quantum mechanics was originally formulated, it was applied to models
whose correspondence limit was non-relativistic classical mechanics. For
instance, the well-known model of the quantum harmonic oscillator uses an
explicitly non-relativistic expression for the kinetic energy of the
oscillator, and is thus a quantum version of the classical harmonic
oscillator.

Early attempts to merge quantum mechanics with special relativity involved
the replacement of the Schrödinger equation with a covariant equation such
as the Klein–Gordon equation or the Dirac equation. While these theories
were successful in explaining many experimental results, they had certain
unsatisfactory qualities stemming from their neglect of the relativistic
creation and annihilation of particles. A fully relativistic quantum theory
required the development of quantum field theory, which applies
quantization to a field (rather than a fixed set of particles). The first
complete quantum field theory, quantum electrodynamics, provides a fully
quantum description of the electromagnetic interaction. The full apparatus
of quantum field theory is often unnecessary for describing electrodynamic
systems. A simpler approach, one that has been employed since the inception
of quantum mechanics, is to treat charged particles as quantum mechanical
objects being acted on by a classical electromagnetic field. For example,
the elementary quantum model of the hydrogen atom describes the electric
field of the hydrogen atom using a classical -e^2/(4 π ϵ_{_0} r) Coulomb
potential. This "semi-classical" approach fails if quantum fluctuations in
the electromagnetic field play an important role, such as in the emission
of photons by charged particles.

Quantum field theories for the strong nuclear force and the weak nuclear
force have also been developed. The quantum field theory of the strong
nuclear force is called quantum chromodynamics, and describes the
interactions of subnuclear particles such as quarks and gluons. The weak
nuclear force and the electromagnetic force were unified, in their
quantized forms, into a single quantum field theory (known as electroweak
theory), by the physicists Abdus Salam, Sheldon Glashow and Steven
Weinberg. These three men shared the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1979 for
this work.³⁵

It has proven difficult to construct quantum models of gravity, the
remaining fundamental force. Semi-classical approximations are workable,
and have led to predictions such as Hawking radiation. However, the
formulation of a complete theory of quantum gravity is hindered by apparent
incompatibilities between general relativity (the most accurate theory of
gravity currently known) and some of the fundamental assumptions of quantum
theory. The resolution of these incompatibilities is an area of active
research, and theories such as string theory are among the possible
candidates for a future theory of quantum gravity.

Classical mechanics has also been extended into the complex domain, with
complex classical mechanics exhibiting behaviors similar to quantum
mechanics.³⁶

Quantum mechanics and classical physics

Predictions of quantum mechanics have been verified experimentally to an
extremely high degree of accuracy.³⁷ According to the correspondence
principle between classical and quantum mechanics, all objects obey the
laws of quantum mechanics, and classical mechanics is just an approximation
for large systems of objects (or a statistical quantum mechanics of a large
collection of particles).³⁸ The laws of classical mechanics thus follow
from the laws of quantum mechanics as a statistical average at the limit of
large systems or large quantum numbers.³⁹ However, chaotic systems do not
have good quantum numbers, and quantum chaos studies the relationship
between classical and quantum descriptions in these systems.

Quantum coherence is an essential difference between classical and quantum
theories as illustrated by the Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen (EPR) paradox — an
attack on a certain philosophical interpretation of quantum mechanics by an
appeal to local realism.⁴⁰ Quantum interference involves adding together
probability amplitudes, whereas classical "waves" infer that there is an
adding together of intensities. For microscopic bodies, the extension of
the system is much smaller than the coherence length, which gives rise to
long-range entanglement and other nonlocal phenomena characteristic of
quantum systems.⁴¹ Quantum coherence is not typically evident at
macroscopic scales, though an exception to this rule may occur at extremely
low temperatures (i.e. approaching absolute zero) at which quantum behavior
may manifest itself macroscopically.⁴² This is in accordance with the
following observations:

- Many macroscopic properties of a classical system are a direct
  consequence of the quantum behavior of its parts. For example, the
  stability of bulk matter (consisting of atoms and molecules which would
  quickly collapse under electric forces alone), the rigidity of solids,
  and the mechanical, thermal, chemical, optical and magnetic properties of
  matter are all results of the interaction of electric charges under the
  rules of quantum mechanics.⁴³
- While the seemingly "exotic" behavior of matter posited by quantum
  mechanics and relativity theory become more apparent when dealing with
  particles of extremely small size or velocities approaching the speed of
  light, the laws of classical, often considered "Newtonian", physics
  remain accurate in predicting the behavior of the vast majority of
  "large" objects (on the order of the size of large molecules or bigger)
  at velocities much smaller than the velocity of light.⁴⁴

Copenhagen interpretation of quantum versus classical kinematics

A big difference between classical and quantum mechanics is that they use
very different kinematic descriptions.⁴⁵

In Niels Bohr's mature view, quantum mechanical phenomena are required to
be experiments, with complete descriptions of all the devices for the
system, preparative, intermediary, and finally measuring. The descriptions
are in macroscopic terms, expressed in ordinary language, supplemented with
the concepts of classical mechanics.⁴⁶ ⁴⁷ ⁴⁸ ⁴⁹ The initial condition and
the final condition of the system are respectively described by values in a
configuration space, for example a position space, or some equivalent space
such as a momentum space. Quantum mechanics does not admit a completely
precise description, in terms of both position and momentum, of an initial
condition or "state" (in the classical sense of the word) that would
support a precisely deterministic and causal prediction of a final
condition.⁵⁰ ⁵¹ In this sense, advocated by Bohr in his mature writings, a
quantum phenomenon is a process, a passage from initial to final condition,
not an instantaneous "state" in the classical sense of that word.⁵² ⁵³ Thus
there are two kinds of processes in quantum mechanics: stationary and
transitional. For a stationary process, the initial and final condition are
the same. For a transition, they are different. Obviously by definition, if
only the initial condition is given, the process is not determined.⁵⁰ Given
its initial condition, prediction of its final condition is possible,
causally but only probabilistically, because the Schrödinger equation is
deterministic for wave function evolution, but the wave function describes
the system only probabilistically.⁵⁴ ⁵⁵

For many experiments, it is possible to think of the initial and final
conditions of the system as being a particle. In some cases it appears that
there are potentially several spatially distinct pathways or trajectories
by which a particle might pass from initial to final condition. It is an
important feature of the quantum kinematic description that it does not
permit a unique definite statement of which of those pathways is actually
followed. Only the initial and final conditions are definite, and, as
stated in the foregoing paragraph, they are defined only as precisely as
allowed by the configuration space description or its equivalent. In every
case for which a quantum kinematic description is needed, there is always a
compelling reason for this restriction of kinematic precision. An example
of such a reason is that for a particle to be experimentally found in a
definite position, it must be held motionless; for it to be experimentally
found to have a definite momentum, it must have free motion; these two are
logically incompatible.⁵⁶ ⁵⁷

Classical kinematics does not primarily demand experimental description of
its phenomena. It allows completely precise description of an instantaneous
state by a value in phase space, the Cartesian product of configuration and
momentum spaces. This description simply assumes or imagines a state as a
physically existing entity without concern about its experimental
measurability. Such a description of an initial condition, together with
Newton's laws of motion, allows a precise deterministic and causal
prediction of a final condition, with a definite trajectory of passage.
Hamiltonian dynamics can be used for this. Classical kinematics also allows
the description of a process analogous to the initial and final condition
description used by quantum mechanics. Lagrangian mechanics applies to
this.⁵⁸ For processes that need account to be taken of actions of a small
number of Planck constants, classical kinematics is not adequate; quantum
mechanics is needed.

Relativity and quantum mechanics

Main article: Relativistic quantum mechanics

Even with the defining postulates of both Einstein's theory of general
relativity and quantum theory being indisputably supported by rigorous and
repeated empirical evidence, and while they do not directly contradict each
other theoretically (at least with regard to their primary claims), they
have proven extremely difficult to incorporate into one consistent,
cohesive model.⁵⁹

Einstein himself is well known for rejecting some of the claims of quantum
mechanics. While clearly contributing to the field, he did not accept many
of the more "philosophical consequences and interpretations" of quantum
mechanics, such as the lack of deterministic causality. He is famously
quoted as saying, in response to this aspect, "My God does not play with
dice". He also had difficulty with the assertion that a single subatomic
particle can occupy numerous areas of space at one time. However, he was
also the first to notice some of the apparently exotic consequences of
entanglement, and used them to formulate the Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen
paradox in the hope of showing that quantum mechanics had unacceptable
implications if taken as a complete description of physical reality. This
was 1935, but in 1964 it was shown by John Bell (see Bell inequality) that
- although Einstein was correct in identifying seemingly paradoxical
implications of quantum mechanical nonlocality - these implications could
be experimentally tested. Alain Aspect's initial experiments in 1982, and
many subsequent experiments since, have definitively verified quantum
entanglement.

According to the paper of J. Bell and the Copenhagen interpretation—the
common interpretation of quantum mechanics by physicists since 1927 - and
contrary to Einstein's ideas, quantum mechanics was not, at the same time a
"realistic" theory and a "local" theory.

The Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen paradox shows in any case that there exist
experiments by which one can measure the state of one particle and
instantaneously change the state of its entangled partner - although the
two particles can be an arbitrary distance apart. However, this effect does
not violate causality, since no transfer of information happens. Quantum
entanglement forms the basis of quantum cryptography, which is used in
high-security commercial applications in banking and government.

Gravity is negligible in many areas of particle physics, so that
unification between general relativity and quantum mechanics is not an
urgent issue in those particular applications. However, the lack of a
correct theory of quantum gravity is an important issue in cosmology and
the search by physicists for an elegant "Theory of Everything" (TOE).
Consequently, resolving the inconsistencies between both theories has been
a major goal of 20th and 21st century physics. Many prominent physicists,
including Stephen Hawking, have labored for many years in the attempt to
discover a theory underlying everything. This TOE would combine not only
the different models of subatomic physics, but also derive the four
fundamental forces of nature - the strong force, electromagnetism, the weak
force, and gravity - from a single force or phenomenon. While Stephen
Hawking was initially a believer in the Theory of Everything, after
considering Gödel's Incompleteness Theorem, he has concluded that one is
not obtainable, and has stated so publicly in his lecture "Gödel and the
End of Physics" (2002).⁶⁰

Attempts at a unified field theory

Main article: Grand unified theory

The quest to unify the fundamental forces through quantum mechanics is
still ongoing. Quantum electrodynamics (or "quantum electromagnetism"),
which is currently (in the perturbative regime at least) the most
accurately tested physical theory in competition with general relativity,⁶¹
⁶² (blog) has been successfully merged with the weak nuclear force into the
electroweak force and work is currently being done to merge the electroweak
and strong force into the electrostrong force. Current predictions state
that at around 10¹⁴ GeV the three aforementioned forces are fused into a
single unified field.⁶³ Beyond this "grand unification", it is speculated
that it may be possible to merge gravity with the other three gauge
symmetries, expected to occur at roughly 10¹⁹ GeV. However — and while
special relativity is parsimoniously incorporated into quantum
electrodynamics — the expanded general relativity, currently the best
theory describing the gravitation force, has not been fully incorporated
into quantum theory. One of those searching for a coherent TOE is Edward
Witten, a theoretical physicist who formulated the M-theory, which is an
attempt at describing the supersymmetrical based string theory. M-theory
posits that our apparent 4-dimensional spacetime is, in reality, actually
an 11-dimensional spacetime containing 10 spatial dimensions and 1 time
dimension, although 7 of the spatial dimensions are - at lower energies -
completely "compactified" (or infinitely curved) and not readily amenable
to measurement or probing.

Another popular theory is Loop quantum gravity (LQG), a theory first
proposed by Carlo Rovelli that describes the quantum properties of gravity.
It is also a theory of quantum space and quantum time, because in general
relativity the geometry of spacetime is a manifestation of gravity. LQG is
an attempt to merge and adapt standard quantum mechanics and standard
general relativity. The main output of the theory is a physical picture of
space where space is granular. The granularity is a direct consequence of
the quantization. It has the same nature of the granularity of the photons
in the quantum theory of electromagnetism or the discrete levels of the
energy of the atoms. But here it is space itself which is discrete. More
precisely, space can be viewed as an extremely fine fabric or network
"woven" of finite loops. These networks of loops are called spin networks.
The evolution of a spin network over time is called a spin foam. The
predicted size of this structure is the Planck length, which is
approximately 1.616×10−35 m. According to theory, there is no meaning to
length shorter than this (cf. Planck scale energy). Therefore, LQG predicts
that not just matter, but also space itself, has an atomic structure.

Philosophical implications

Main article: Interpretations of quantum mechanics

Since its inception, the many counter-intuitive aspects and results of
quantum mechanics have provoked strong philosophical debates and many
interpretations. Even fundamental issues, such as Max Born's basic rules
concerning probability amplitudes and probability distributions, took
decades to be appreciated by society and many leading scientists. Richard
Feynman once said, "I think I can safely say that nobody understands
quantum mechanics."⁶⁴ According to Steven Weinberg, "There is now in my
opinion no entirely satisfactory interpretation of quantum mechanics."⁶⁵

The Copenhagen interpretation - due largely to the Danish theoretical
physicist Niels Bohr - remains the quantum mechanical formalism that is
currently most widely accepted amongst physicists, some 75 years after its
enunciation. According to this interpretation, the probabilistic nature of
quantum mechanics is not a temporary feature which will eventually be
replaced by a deterministic theory, but instead must be considered a final
renunciation of the classical idea of "causality." It is also believed
therein that any well-defined application of the quantum mechanical
formalism must always make reference to the experimental arrangement, due
to the conjugate nature of evidence obtained under different experimental
situations.

Albert Einstein, himself one of the founders of quantum theory, rejected
the quantum theoretical doctrine that the state of a system depends on the
experimental arrangement for its measurement. He held that underlying
quantum mechanics there should be a theory that thoroughly and directly
expresses the rule against action at a distance; in other words, he
insisted on the principle of locality. He inferred that the present theory
was incomplete, contrary to the Copenhagen doctrine that it is complete. He
therefore produced a series of objections, the most famous of which has
become known as the Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen paradox.

John Bell showed that this "EPR" paradox led to experimentally testable
differences between quantum mechanics and theories that rely on added
hidden variables. Experiments have been performed confirming the accuracy
of quantum mechanics, thereby demonstrating that quantum mechanics cannot
be improved upon by addition of hidden variables.⁶⁶ The Bohr-Einstein
debates provide a vibrant critique of the Copenhagen Interpretation from an
epistemological point of view.

The Everett many-worlds interpretation, formulated in 1956, holds that all
the possibilities described by quantum theory simultaneously occur in a
multiverse composed of mostly independent parallel universes.⁶⁷ This is not
accomplished by introducing some "new axiom" to quantum mechanics, but on
the contrary, by removing the axiom of the collapse of the wave packet. All
of the possible consistent states of the measured system and the measuring
apparatus (including the observer) are present in a real physical - not
just formally mathematical, as in other interpretations - quantum
superposition. Such a superposition of consistent state combinations of
different systems is called an entangled state. While the multiverse is
deterministic, we perceive non-deterministic behavior governed by
probabilities, because we can only observe the universe (i.e., the
consistent state contribution to the aforementioned superposition) that we,
as observers, inhabit. Everett's interpretation is perfectly consistent
with John Bell's experiments and makes them intuitively understandable.
However, according to the theory of quantum decoherence, these "parallel
universes" will never be accessible to us. The inaccessibility can be
understood as follows: once a measurement is done, the measured system
becomes entangled with both the physicist who measured it and a huge number
of other particles, some of which are photons flying away at the speed of
light towards the other end of the universe. In order to prove that the
wave function did not collapse, one would have to bring all these particles
back and measure them again, together with the system that was originally
measured. Not only is this completely impractical, but even if one could
theoretically do this, it would have to destroy any evidence that the
original measurement took place (including the physicist's memory). In
light of these Bell tests, Cramer (1986) formulated his transactional
interpretation.⁶⁸ Relational quantum mechanics appeared in the late 1990s
as the modern derivative of the Copenhagen Interpretation.

Applications

Quantum mechanics has had enormous⁶⁹ success in explaining many of the
features of our universe. Quantum mechanics is often the only tool
available that can reveal the individual behaviors of the subatomic
particles that make up all forms of matter (electrons, protons, neutrons,
photons, and others). Quantum mechanics has strongly influenced string
theories, candidates for a Theory of Everything (see reductionism).

Quantum mechanics is also critically important for understanding how
individual atoms combine covalently to form molecules. The application of
quantum mechanics to chemistry is known as quantum chemistry. Relativistic
quantum mechanics can, in principle, mathematically describe most of
chemistry. Quantum mechanics can also provide quantitative insight into
ionic and covalent bonding processes by explicitly showing which molecules
are energetically favorable to which others and the magnitudes of the
energies involved.⁷⁰ Furthermore, most of the calculations performed in
modern computational chemistry rely on quantum mechanics.

A great deal of modern technological inventions operate at a scale where
quantum effects are significant. Examples include the laser, the transistor
(and thus the microchip), the electron microscope, and magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI). The study of semiconductors led to the invention of the
diode and the transistor, which are indispensable parts of modern
electronics systems and devices.

Researchers are currently seeking robust methods of directly manipulating
quantum states. Efforts are being made to more fully develop quantum
cryptography, which will theoretically allow guaranteed secure transmission
of information. A more distant goal is the development of quantum
computers, which are expected to perform certain computational tasks
exponentially faster than classical computers. Instead of using classical
bits, quantum computers use qubits, which can be in superpositions of
states. Another active research topic is quantum teleportation, which deals
with techniques to transmit quantum information over arbitrary distances.

Quantum tunneling is vital to the operation of many devices. Even in the
simple light switch, the electrons in the electric current could not
penetrate the potential barrier made up of a layer of oxide without quantum
tunneling. Flash memory chips found in USB drives use quantum tunneling to
erase their memory cells.

While quantum mechanics primarily applies to the smaller atomic regimes of
matter and energy, some systems exhibit quantum mechanical effects on a
large scale. Superfluidity, the frictionless flow of a liquid at
temperatures near absolute zero, is one well-known example. So is the
closely related phenomenon of superconductivity, the frictionless flow of
an electron gas in a conducting material (an electric current) at
sufficiently low temperatures.

Quantum theory also provides accurate descriptions for many previously
unexplained phenomena, such as black-body radiation and the stability of
the orbitals of electrons in atoms. It has also given insight into the
workings of many different biological systems, including smell receptors
and protein structures.⁷¹ Recent work on photosynthesis has provided
evidence that quantum correlations play an essential role in this
fundamental process of plants and many other organisms.⁷² Even so,
classical physics can often provide good approximations to results
otherwise obtained by quantum physics, typically in circumstances with
large numbers of particles or large quantum numbers. Since classical
formulas are much simpler and easier to compute than quantum formulas,
classical approximations are used and preferred when the system is large
enough to render the effects of quantum mechanics insignificant.

Examples

Free particle

For example, consider a free particle. In quantum mechanics, there is
wave–particle duality, so the properties of the particle can be described
as the properties of a wave. Therefore, its quantum state can be
represented as a wave of arbitrary shape and extending over space as a wave
function. The position and momentum of the particle are observables. The
Uncertainty Principle states that both the position and the momentum cannot
simultaneously be measured with complete precision. However, one can
measure the position (alone) of a moving free particle, creating an
eigenstate of position with a wavefunction that is very large (a Dirac
delta) at a particular position x, and zero everywhere else. If one
performs a position measurement on such a wavefunction, the resultant x
will be obtained with 100% probability (i.e., with full certainty, or
complete precision). This is called an eigenstate of position—or, stated in
mathematical terms, a generalized position eigenstate (eigendistribution).
If the particle is in an eigenstate of position, then its momentum is
completely unknown. On the other hand, if the particle is in an eigenstate
of momentum, then its position is completely unknown.⁷³ In an eigenstate of
momentum having a plane wave form, it can be shown that the wavelength is
equal to h/p, where h is Planck's constant and p is the momentum of the
eigenstate.⁷⁴

Step potential

Main article: Solution of Schrödinger equation for a step potential

The potential in this case is given by:

V(x)= \begin{cases} 0, & x < 0, V_0, & x \ge 0. \end{cases}

The solutions are superpositions of left- and right-moving waves:

ψ_1(x)= \frac{1}{√(k₁)} \left (A_→e^{i k_1 x} + A_←e^{-ik_1x}\right ) x<0
ψ_2(x)= \frac{1}{√(k₂)} \left (B_→e^{i k_2 x} + B_←e^{-ik_2x}\right ) x>0

where the wave vectors are related to the energy via

k_1=√(2m E/\hbar ²)
k_2=√(2m (E-V_0)/\hbar ²)

with coefficients A and B determined from the boundary conditions and by
imposing a continuous derivative on the solution.

Each term of the solution can be interpreted as an incident, reflected, or
transmitted component of the wave, allowing the calculation of transmission
and reflection coefficients. Notably, in contrast to classical mechanics,
incident particles with energies greater than the potential step are
partially reflected.

Rectangular potential barrier

Main article: Rectangular potential barrier

This is a model for the quantum tunneling effect which plays an important
role in the performance of modern technologies such as flash memory and
scanning tunneling microscopy. Quantum tunneling is central to physical
phenomena involved in superlattices.

Particle in a box

Main article: Particle in a box

The particle in a one-dimensional potential energy box is the most
mathematically simple example where restraints lead to the quantization of
energy levels. The box is defined as having zero potential energy
everywhere inside a certain region, and infinite potential energy
everywhere outside that region. For the one-dimensional case in the x
direction, the time-independent Schrödinger equation may be written⁷⁵

- \frac {\hbar ^2}{2m} \frac {d ^2 ψ}{dx^2} = E ψ.

With the differential operator defined by

\hat{p} _x = -i\hbar \frac{d}{dx}

the previous equation is evocative of the classic kinetic energy analogue,

\frac{1}{2m} \hat{p} ₓ² ⁼ E,

with state ψ in this case having energy E coincident with the kinetic
energy of the particle.

The general solutions of the Schrödinger equation for the particle in a box
are

ψ(x) = A e^{ikx} + B e ^{-ikx} \qquad \qquad E = \frac{\hbar ² k²}{2m}

or, from Euler's formula,

ψ(x) = C \sin kx + D \cos kx.

The infinite potential walls of the box determine the values of C, D, and k
at x = 0 and x = L where ψ must be zero. Thus, at x = 0,

ψ(0) = 0 = C\sin 0 + D\cos 0 = D

and D = 0. At x = L,

ψ(L) = 0 = C\sin kL.

in which C cannot be zero as this would conflict with the Born
interpretation. Therefore, since sin(kL) = 0, kL must be an integer
multiple of π,

k = \frac{nπ}{L} \qquad \qquad n=1,2,3,….

The quantization of energy levels follows from this constraint on k, since

E = \frac{\hbar ^2 π² ⁿ²}{2mL²} = \frac{n²h²}{8mL²} .

Finite potential well

Main article: Finite potential well

A finite potential well is the generalization of the infinite potential
well problem to potential wells having finite depth.

The finite potential well problem is mathematically more complicated than
the infinite particle-in-a-box problem as the wavefunction is not pinned to
zero at the walls of the well. Instead, the wavefunction must satisfy more
complicated mathematical boundary conditions as it is nonzero in regions
outside the well.

Harmonic oscillator

Main article: Quantum harmonic oscillator

As in the classical case, the potential for the quantum harmonic oscillator
is given by

V(x)=\frac{1}{2} mω²x²

This problem can either be treated by directly solving the Schrödinger
equation, which is not trivial, or by using the more elegant "ladder
method" first proposed by Paul Dirac. The eigenstates are given by

ψ_n(x) = √(\frac{1}{2^n n!} ) ·\left (\frac{mω}{π\hbar } \right )^{1/4}
·e^{ - \frac{mωx²}{2 \hbar } } ·H_n\left (√(\frac{mω}{\hbar } ) x \right ),
\qquad n = 0,1,2,….

where Hₙ are the Hermite polynomials,

H_n(x)=(-1)^n e^{x^2}\frac{dⁿ}{dxⁿ} \left (e^{-x^2}\right )

and the corresponding energy levels are

E_n = \hbar ω\left (n + {1\over 2}\right )

This is another example illustrating the quantization of energy for bound
states.

Radioactive decay

For particle decay in a more general context, see Particle decay. For more
information on hazards of various kinds of radiation from decay, see
Ionizing radiation.
"Radioactive" redirects here. For other uses, see Radioactive
(disambiguation).
"Radioactivity" redirects here. For other uses, see Radioactivity
(disambiguation).

Radioactive decay, also known as nuclear decay or radioactivity, is the
process by which a nucleus of an unstable atom loses energy by emitting
radiation. A material that spontaneously emits such radiation — which
includes alpha particles, beta particles, gamma rays and conversion
electrons — is considered radioactive.

Radioactive decay is a stochastic (i.e. random) process at the level of
single atoms, in that, according to quantum theory, it is impossible to
predict when a particular atom will decay.¹ ² ³ ⁴ The chance that a given
atom will decay never changes, that is, it does not matter how long the
atom has existed. For a large collection of atoms however, the decay rate
for that collection can be calculated from their measured decay constants
or half-lives. This is the basis of radiometric dating. The half-lives of
radioactive atoms have no known limits for shortness or length of duration,
and range over 55 orders of magnitude in time.

There are many types of radioactive decay (see table below). A decay, or
loss of energy from the nucleus, results when an atom with one type of
nucleus, called the parent radionuclide (or parent radioisotope[note 1]),
transforms into an atom with a nucleus in a different state, or with a
nucleus containing a different number of protons and neutrons. The product
is called the daughter nuclide. In some decays, the parent and the daughter
nuclides are different chemical elements, and thus the decay process
results in the creation of an atom of a different element. This is known as
a nuclear transmutation.

The first decay processes to be discovered were alpha decay, beta decay,
and gamma decay. Alpha decay occurs when the nucleus ejects an alpha
particle (helium nucleus). This is the most common process of emitting
nucleons, but in rarer types of decays, nuclei can eject protons, or in the
case of cluster decay specific nuclei of other elements. Beta decay occurs
when the nucleus emits an electron or positron and a neutrino, in a process
that changes a proton to a neutron or the other way about. The nucleus may
capture an orbiting electron, causing a proton to convert into a neutron in
a process called electron capture. All of these processes result in a
well-defined nuclear transmutation.

By contrast, there are radioactive decay processes that do not result in a
nuclear transmutation. The energy of an excited nucleus may be emitted as a
gamma ray in a process called gamma decay, or be used to eject an orbital
electron by its interaction with the excited nucleus, in a process called
internal conversion. Highly excited neutron-rich nuclei, formed as the
product of other types of decay, occasionally lose energy by way of neutron
emission, resulting in a change of an element from one isotope to another.

Another type of radioactive decay results in products that are not defined,
but appear in a range of "pieces" of the original nucleus. This decay,
called spontaneous fission, happens when a large unstable nucleus
spontaneously splits into two (and occasionally three) smaller daughter
nuclei, and generally leads to the emission of gamma rays, neutrons, or
other particles from those products.

For a summary table showing the number of stable and radioactive nuclides
in each category, see radionuclide. There exist twenty-nine chemical
elements on Earth that are radioactive. They are those that contain
thirty-four radionuclides that date before the time of formation of the
solar system, and are known as primordial nuclides. Well-known examples are
uranium and thorium, but also included are naturally occurring long-lived
radioisotopes such as potassium-40. Another fifty or so shorter-lived
radionuclides, such as radium and radon, found on Earth, are the products
of decay chains that began with the primordial nuclides, and ongoing
cosmogenic processes, such as the production of carbon-14 from nitrogen-14
by cosmic rays. Radionuclides may also be produced artificially in particle
accelerators or nuclear reactors, resulting in 650 of these with half-lives
of over an hour, and several thousand more with even shorter half-lives.
See this list of nuclides for a list of these, sorted by half life.

History of discovery

Radioactivity was discovered in 1896 by the French scientist Henri
Becquerel, while working with phosphorescent materials.⁵ These materials
glow in the dark after exposure to light, and he suspected that the glow
produced in cathode ray tubes by X-rays might be associated with
phosphorescence. He wrapped a photographic plate in black paper and placed
various phosphorescent salts on it. All results were negative until he used
uranium salts. The uranium salts caused a blackening of the plate in spite
of the plate being wrapped in black paper. These radiations were given the
name "Becquerel Rays".

It soon became clear that the blackening of the plate had nothing to do
with phosphorescence, as the blackening was also produced by
non-phosphorescent salts of uranium and metallic uranium. It became clear
from these experiments that there was a form of invisible radiation that
could pass through paper and was causing the plate to react as if exposed
to light.

At first, it seemed as though the new radiation was similar to the then
recently discovered X-rays. Further research by Becquerel, Ernest
Rutherford, Paul Villard, Pierre Curie, Marie Curie, and others showed that
this form of radioactivity was significantly more complicated. Rutherford
was the first to realize that all such elements decay in accordance with
the same mathematical exponential formula. Rutherford and his student
Frederick Soddy were the first to realize that many decay processes
resulted in the transmutation of one element to another. Subsequently, the
radioactive displacement law of Fajans and Soddy was formulated to describe
the products of alpha and beta decay.⁶ ⁷

The early researchers also discovered that many other chemical elements,
besides uranium, have radioactive isotopes. A systematic search for the
total radioactivity in uranium ores also guided Pierre and Marie Curie to
isolate two new elements: polonium and radium. Except for the radioactivity
of radium, the chemical similarity of radium to barium made these two
elements difficult to distinguish.

Early health dangers

Main article: ionizing radiation

The dangers of ionizing radiation due to radioactivity and X-rays were not
immediately recognized.

X-rays

The discovery of x‑rays by Wilhelm Röntgen in 1895 led to widespread
experimentation by scientists, physicians, and inventors. Many people began
recounting stories of burns, hair loss and worse in technical journals as
early as 1896. In February of that year, Professor Daniel and Dr. Dudley of
Vanderbilt University performed an experiment involving X-raying Dudley's
head that resulted in his hair loss. A report by Dr. H.D. Hawks, of his
suffering severe hand and chest burns in an X-ray demonstration, was the
first of many other reports in Electrical Review.⁸

Other experimenters including Elihu Thomson, and Nikola Tesla also reported
burns. Thomson deliberately exposed a finger to an X-ray tube over a period
of time and suffered pain, swelling, and blistering.⁹ Other effects,
including ultraviolet rays and ozone were sometimes blamed for the
damage,¹⁰ and many physicians still claimed that there were no effects from
X-ray exposure at all.⁹

Despite this, there were some early systematic hazard investigations, and
as early as 1902 William Herbert Rollins wrote almost despairingly that his
warnings about the dangers involved in careless use of X-rays was not being
heeded, either by industry or by his colleagues. By this time Rollins had
proved that X-rays could kill experimental animals, could cause a pregnant
guinea pig to abort, and that they could kill a fetus.¹¹ He also stressed
that "animals vary in susceptibility to the external action of X-light" and
warned that these differences be considered when patients were treated by
means of X-rays.

Radioactive substances

However, the biological effects of radiation due to radioactive substances
were less easy to gauge. This gave the opportunity for many physicians and
corporations to market radioactive substances as patent medicines. Examples
were radium enema treatments, and radium-containing waters to be drunk as
tonics. Marie Curie protested against this sort of treatment, warning that
the effects of radiation on the human body were not well understood. Curie
later died from aplastic anaemia, likely caused by exposure to ionizing
radiation. By the 1930s, after a number of cases of bone necrosis and death
of radium treatment enthusiasts, radium-containing medicinal products had
been largely removed from the market (radioactive quackery).

Radiation protection

Main article: Radiation protection
See also: Sievert and Ionizing radiation

Only a year after Röntgen's discovery of X rays, the American engineer
Wolfram Fuchs (1896) gave what is probably the first protection advice, but
it was not until 1925 that the first International Congress of Radiology
(ICR) was held and considered establishing international protection
standards. The effects of radiation on genes, including the effect of
cancer risk, were recognized much later. In 1927, Hermann Joseph Muller
published research showing genetic effects and, in 1946, was awarded the
Nobel prize for his findings.

The second ICR was held in Stockholm in 1928 and proposed the adoption of
the rontgen unit, and the 'International X-ray and Radium Protection
Committee' (IXRPC) was formed. Rolf Sievert was named Chairman, but a
driving force was George Kaye of the British National Physical Laboratory.
The committee met in 1931, 1934 and 1937.

After World War II the increased range and quantity of radioactive
substances being handled as a result of military and civil nuclear
programmes led to large groups of occupational workers and the public being
potentially exposed to harmful levels of ionising radiation. This was
considered at the first post-war ICR convened in London in 1950, when the
present International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) was
born.¹² Since then the ICRP has developed the present international system
of radiation protection, covering all aspects of radiation hazard.

Units of radioactivity

The International System of Units (SI) unit of radioactive activity is the
becquerel (Bq), named in honour of the scientist Henri Becquerel. One Bq is
defined as one transformation (or decay or disintegration) per second.

An older unit of radioactivity is the curie, Ci, which was originally
defined as "the quantity or mass of radium emanation in equilibrium with
one gram of radium (element)".¹³ Today, the curie is defined as 3.7×10¹⁰
disintegrations per second, so that 1 curie (Ci) = 3.7×10¹⁰ Bq. For
radiological protection purposes, although the United States Nuclear
Regulatory Commission permits the use of the unit curie alongside SI
units,¹⁴ the European Union European units of measurement directives
required that its use for "public health ... purposes" be phased out by 31
December 1985.¹⁵

Types of decay

Early researchers found that an electric or magnetic field could split
radioactive emissions into three types of beams. The rays were given the
names alpha, beta, and gamma, in order of their ability to penetrate
matter. While alpha decay was seen only in heavier elements of atomic
number 52 (tellurium) and greater, the other two types of decay were
produced by all of the elements. Lead, atomic number 82, is the heaviest
element to have any isotopes stable (to the limit of measurement) to
radioactive decay. Radioactive decay is seen in all isotopes of all
elements of atomic number 83 (bismuth) or greater. Bismuth, however, is
only very slightly radioactive.

In analysing the nature of the decay products, it was obvious from the
direction of the electromagnetic forces applied to the radiations by
external magnetic and electric fields that alpha particles carried a
positive charge, beta particles carried a negative charge, and gamma rays
were neutral. From the magnitude of deflection, it was clear that alpha
particles were much more massive than beta particles. Passing alpha
particles through a very thin glass window and trapping them in a discharge
tube allowed researchers to study the emission spectrum of the captured
particles, and ultimately proved that alpha particles are helium nuclei.
Other experiments showed beta radiation, resulting from decay and cathode
rays, were high-speed electrons. Likewise, gamma radiation and X-rays were
found to be high-energy electromagnetic radiation.

The relationship between the types of decays also began to be examined: For
example, gamma decay was almost always found to be associated with other
types of decay, and occurred at about the same time, or afterwards. Gamma
decay as a separate phenomenon, with its own half-life (now termed isomeric
transition), was found in natural radioactivity to be a result of the gamma
decay of excited metastable nuclear isomers, which were in turn created
from other types of decay.

Although alpha, beta, and gamma radiations were most commonly found, other
types of emission were eventually discovered. Shortly after the discovery
of the positron in cosmic ray products, it was realized that the same
process that operates in classical beta decay can also produce positrons
(positron emission), along with neutrinos (classical beta decay produces
antineutrinos). In a more common analogous process, called electron
capture, some proton-rich nuclides were found to capture their own atomic
electrons instead of emitting positrons, and subsequently these nuclides
emit only a neutrino and a gamma ray from the excited nucleus (and often
also Auger electrons and characteristic X-rays, as a result of the
re-ordering of electrons to fill the place of the missing captured
electron). These types of decay involve the nuclear capture of electrons or
emission of electrons or positrons, and thus acts to move a nucleus toward
the ratio of neutrons to protons that has the least energy for a given
total number of nucleons. This consequently produces a more stable (lower
energy) nucleus.

(A theoretical process of positron capture, analogous to electron capture,
is possible in antimatter atoms, but has not been observed, as complex
antimatter atoms (beyond antihelium) are not experimentally available.¹⁶
Such a decay would require antimatter atoms at least as complex as
beryllium-7, which is the lightest known isotope of normal matter to
undergo decay by electron capture.)

Shortly after the discovery of the neutron in 1932, Enrico Fermi realized
that certain rare beta-decay reactions immediately yield neutrons as a
decay particle (neutron emission). Isolated proton emission was eventually
observed in some elements. It was also found that some heavy elements may
undergo spontaneous fission into products that vary in composition. In a
phenomenon called cluster decay, specific combinations of neutrons and
protons other than alpha particles (helium nuclei) were found to be
spontaneously emitted from atoms.

Other types of radioactive decay were found to emit previously-seen
particles, but via different mechanisms. An example is internal conversion,
which results in an initial electron emission, and then often further
characteristic X-rays and Auger electrons emissions, although the internal
conversion process involves neither beta nor gamma decay. A neutrino is not
emitted, and none of the electron(s) and photon(s) emitted originate in the
nucleus, even though the energy to emit all of them does originate there.
Internal conversion decay, like isomeric transition gamma decay and neutron
emission, involves the release of energy by an excited nuclide, without the
transmutation of one element into another.

Rare events that involve a combination of two beta-decay type events
happening simultaneously are known (see below). Any decay process that does
not violate the conservation of energy or momentum laws (and perhaps other
particle conservation laws) is permitted to happen, although not all have
been detected. An interesting example discussed in a final section, is
bound state beta decay of rhenium-187. In this process, beta electron-decay
of the parent nuclide is not accompanied by beta electron emission, because
the beta particle has been captured into the K-shell of the emitting atom.
An antineutrino is emitted, as in all negative beta decays.

Radionuclides can undergo a number of different reactions. These are
summarized in the following table. A nucleus with mass number A and atomic
number Z is represented as (A, Z). The column "Daughter nucleus" indicates
the difference between the new nucleus and the original nucleus. Thus, (A −
1, Z) means that the mass number is one less than before, but the atomic
number is the same as before.

If energy circumstances are favorable, a given radionuclide may undergo
many competing types of decay, with some atoms decaying by one route, and
others decaying by another. An example is copper-64, which has 29 protons,
and 35 neutrons, which decays with a half-life of about 12.7 hours. This
isotope has one unpaired proton and one unpaired neutron, so either the
proton or the neutron can decay to the opposite particle. This particular
nuclide (though not all nuclides in this situation) is almost equally
likely to decay through proton decay, producing a positron emission (18%),
or through electron capture (43%), as it does through neutron decay by
electron emission (39%). The excited energy states resulting from these
decays which fail to end in a ground energy state, also produce later
internal conversion and gamma decay in almost 0.5% of the time.

Radioactive decay results in a reduction of summed rest mass, once the
released energy (the disintegration energy) has escaped in some way.
Although decay energy is sometimes defined as associated with the
difference between the mass of the parent nuclide products and the mass of
the decay products, this is true only of rest mass measurements, where some
energy has been removed from the product system. This is true because the
decay energy must always carry mass with it, wherever it appears (see mass
in special relativity) according to the formula E = mc². The decay energy
is initially released as the energy of emitted photons plus the kinetic
energy of massive emitted particles (that is, particles that have rest
mass). If these particles come to thermal equilibrium with their
surroundings and photons are absorbed, then the decay energy is transformed
to thermal energy, which retains its mass.

Decay energy therefore remains associated with a certain measure of mass of
the decay system, called invariant mass, which does not change during the
decay, even though the energy of decay is distributed among decay
particles. The energy of photons, the kinetic energy of emitted particles,
and, later, the thermal energy of the surrounding matter, all contribute to
the invariant mass of the system. Thus, while the sum of the rest masses of
the particles is not conserved in radioactive decay, the system mass and
system invariant mass (and also the system total energy) is conserved
throughout any decay process. This is a restatement of the equivalent laws
of conservation of energy and conservation of mass.

Radioactive decay rates

The decay rate, or activity, of a radioactive substance is characterized
by:

Constant quantities:

- The half-life—t1/2, is the time taken for the activity of a given amount
  of a radioactive substance to decay to half of its initial value; see
  List of nuclides.
- The decay constant— λ, "lambda" the inverse of the mean lifetime,
  sometimes referred to as simply decay rate.
- The mean lifetime— τ, "tau" the average lifetime of a radioactive
  particle before decay.

Although these are constants, they are associated with the statistical
behavior of populations of atoms. In consequence, predictions using these
constants are less accurate for minuscule samples of atoms.

In principle a half-life, a third-life, or even a (1/√2)-life, can be used
in exactly the same way as half-life; but the mean life and half-life t1/2
have been adopted as standard times associated with exponential decay.

Time-variable quantities:

- Total activity— A, is the number of decays per unit time of a radioactive
  sample.
- Number of particles—N, is the total number of particles in the sample.
- Specific activity—SA, number of decays per unit time per amount of
  substance of the sample at time set to zero (t = 0). "Amount of
  substance" can be the mass, volume or moles of the initial sample.

These are related as follows:

t_{1/2} = \frac{\ln (2)}{λ} = τ\ln (2)
A = - \frac{\mathrm{d} N}{\mathrm{d} t} = λN
S_A a_0 = - \frac{\mathrm{d} N}{\mathrm{d} t} \bigg |_{t=0} = λN₀

where N₀ is the initial amount of active substance — substance that has the
same percentage of unstable particles as when the substance was formed.

Mathematics of radioactive decay

exponential decay.
For related derivations with some further details, see half-life.
For the analogous mathematics in 1st order chemical reactions, see
Consecutive reactions.

Universal law of radioactive decay

Radioactivity is one very frequently given example of exponential decay.
The law describes the statistical behaviour of a large number of nuclides,
rather than individual atoms. In the following formalism, the number of
nuclides or the nuclide population N, is of course a discrete variable (a
natural number)—but for any physical sample N is so large that it can be
treated as a continuous variable. Differential calculus is needed to set up
differential equations for the modelling the behaviour of the nuclear
decay.

The mathematics of radioactive decay depend on a key assumption that a
nucleus of a radionuclide has no "memory" or way of translating its history
into its present behavior. A nucleus does not "age" with the passage of
time. Thus, the probability of its breaking down does not increase with
time, but stays constant no matter how long the nucleus has existed. This
constant probability may vary greatly between different types of nuclei,
leading to the many different observed decay rates. However, whatever the
probability is, it does not change. This is in marked contrast to complex
objects which do show aging, such as automobiles and humans. These systems
do have a chance of breakdown per unit of time, that increases from the
moment they begin their existence.

One-decay process

Consider the case of a nuclide A that decays into another B by some process
A → B (emission of other particles, like electron neutrinos ν
e and electrons e− as in beta decay, are irrelevant in what follows). The
decay of an unstable nucleus is entirely random and it is impossible to
predict when a particular atom will decay.¹ However, it is equally likely
to decay at any instant in time. Therefore, given a sample of a particular
radioisotope, the number of decay events −dN expected to occur in a small
interval of time dt is proportional to the number of atoms present N, that
is¹⁷

-\frac{\mathrm{d} N}{\mathrm{d} t} \propto N.

Particular radionuclides decay at different rates, so each has its own
decay constant λ. The expected decay −dN/N is proportional to an increment
of time, dt:

The negative sign indicates that N decreases as time increases, as the
decay events follow one after another. The solution to this first-order
differential equation is the function:

N(t) = N_0 e^{-{λ}t} = N_0 e^{-t/ τ},

where N₀ is the value of N at time t = 0.¹⁷

We have for all time t:

N_A + N_B = N_\mathrm{total} = N_{A0},

where Nₜₒₜₐₗ is the constant number of particles throughout the decay
process, which is equal to the initial number of A nuclides since this is
the initial substance.

If the number of non-decayed A nuclei is:

N_A = N_{A0}e^{-{λ}t}

then the number of nuclei of B, i.e. the number of decayed A nuclei, is

N_B = N_{A0} - N_A = N_{A0} - N_{A0}e^{-{λ}t} = N_{A0} \left ( 1 -
e^{-{λ}t} \right ).

The number of decays observed over a given interval obeys Poisson
statistics. If the average number of decays is <N>, the probability of a
given number of decays N is¹⁷

P(N) = \frac{\langle N \rangle ^N \exp (-\langle N\rangle )}{N!} .

Chain-decay processes

Chain of two decays

Now consider the case of a chain of two decays: one nuclide A decaying into
another B by one process, then B decaying into another C by a second
process, i.e. A → B → C. The previous equation cannot be applied to the
decay chain, but can be generalized as follows. Since A decays into B, then
B decays into C, the activity of A adds to the total number of B nuclides
in the present sample, before those B nuclides decay and reduce the number
of nuclides leading to the later sample. In other words, the number of
second generation nuclei B increases as a result of the first generation
nuclei decay of A, and decreases as a result of its own decay into the
third generation nuclei C.¹⁸ The sum of these two terms gives the law for a
decay chain for two nuclides:

\frac{\mathrm{d} N_B}{\mathrm{d} t} = -λ_B N_B + λ_A N_A.

The rate of change of NB, that is dNB/dt, is related to the changes in the
amounts of A and B, NB can increase as B is produced from A and decrease as
B produces C.

Re-writing using the previous results:

The subscripts simply refer to the respective nuclides, i.e. NA is the
number of nuclides of type A, NA0 is the initial number of nuclides of type
A, λA is the decay constant for A - and similarly for nuclide B. Solving
this equation for NB gives:

N_B = \frac{N_{A0}λ_A}{λ_B - λ_A} \left ( e^{-λ_A t} - e^{-λ_B t}\right ) .

In the case where B is a stable nuclide (λB = 0), this equation reduces to
the previous solution:

\lim _{λ_B→0} \left [ \frac{N_{A0}λ_A}{λ_B - λ_A} \left ( e^{-λ_A t} -
e^{-λ_B t}\right ) \right ] = \frac{N_{A0}λ_A}{0 - λ_A} \left ( e^{-λ_A t}
- 1 \right ) = N_{A0} \left ( 1- e^{-λ_A t} \right ),

as shown above for one decay. The solution can be found by the integration
factor method, where the integrating factor is eλBt. This case is perhaps
the most useful, since it can derive both the one-decay equation (above)
and the equation for multi-decay chains (below) more directly.

Chain of any number of decays

For the general case of any number of consecutive decays in a decay chain,
i.e. A₁ → A₂ ··· → Ai ··· → AD, where D is the number of decays and i is a
dummy index (i = 1, 2, 3, ...D), each nuclide population can be found in
terms of the previous population. In this case N₂ = 0, N₃ = 0,..., ND = 0.
Using the above result in a recursive form:

\frac{\mathrm{d} N_j}{\mathrm{d} t} = - λ_j N_j + λ_{j-1} N_{(j-1)0}
e^{-λ_{j-1} t}.

The general solution to the recursive problem is given by Bateman's
equations:¹⁹

Alternative decay modes

In all of the above examples, the initial nuclide decays into only one
product.²⁰ Consider the case of one initial nuclide that can decay into
either of two products, that is A → B and A → C in parallel. For example,
in a sample of potassium-40, 89.3% of the nuclei decay to calcium-40 and
10.7% to argon-40. We have for all time t:

N = N_A + N_B + N_C

which is constant, since the total number of nuclides remains constant.
Differentiating with respect to time:

\frac{\mathrm{d} N_A}{\mathrm{d} t} = - \left (\frac{\mathrm{d}
N_B}{\mathrm{d} t} + \frac{\mathrm{d} N_C}{\mathrm{d} t} \right ) - λN_A &
= - N_A \left ( λ_B + λ_C \right )

defining the total decay constant λ in terms of the sum of partial decay
constants λB and λC:

λ= λ_B + λ_C .

Notice that

\frac{\mathrm{d} N_A}{\mathrm{d} t} < 0,\frac{\mathrm{d} N_B}{\mathrm{d} t}
> 0, \frac{\mathrm{d} N_C}{\mathrm{d} t} > 0.

Solving this equation for NA:

N_A = N_{A0} e^{-λt} .

where NA0 is the initial number of nuclide A. When measuring the production
of one nuclide, one can only observe the total decay constant λ. The decay
constants λB and λC determine the probability for the decay to result in
products B or C as follows:

N_B = \frac{λ_B}{λ} N_{A0} \left ( 1 - e^{-λt} \right ),
N_C = \frac{λ_C}{λ} N_{A0} \left ( 1 - e^{-λt} \right ).

because the fraction λB/λ of nuclei decay into B while the fraction λC/λ of
nuclei decay into C.

Corollaries of the decay laws

The above equations can also be written using quantities related to the
number of nuclide particles N in a sample;

- The activity: A = λN.
- The amount of substance: n = N/L.
- The mass: M = Arn = ArN/L.

where L = 6.022×10²³ is Avogadro's constant, Ar is the relative atomic mass
number, and the amount of the substance is in moles.

Decay timing: definitions and relations

Time constant and mean-life

For the one-decay solution A → B:

N = N_0 e^{-{λ}t} = N_0 e^{-t/ τ},

the equation indicates that the decay constant λ has units of t−1, and can
thus also be represented as 1/τ, where τ is a characteristic time of the
process called the time constant.

In a radioactive decay process, this time constant is also the mean
lifetime for decaying atoms. Each atom "lives" for a finite amount of time
before it decays, and it may be shown that this mean lifetime is the
arithmetic mean of all the atoms' lifetimes, and that it is τ, which again
is related to the decay constant as follows:

τ= \frac{1}{λ} .

This form is also true for two-decay processes simultaneously A → B + C,
inserting the equivalent values of decay constants (as given above)

λ= λ_B + λ_C

into the decay solution leads to:

\frac{1}{τ} = λ= λ_B + λ_C = \frac{1}{τ_B} + \frac{1}{τ_C}

Half-life

A more commonly used parameter is the half-life. Given a sample of a
particular radionuclide, the half-life is the time taken for half the
radionuclide's atoms to decay. For the case of one-decay nuclear reactions:

N = N_0 e^{-{λ}t} = N_0 e^{-t/ τ},

the half-life is related to the decay constant as follows: set N = N₀/2 and
t = T1/2 to obtain

t_{1/2} = \frac{\ln 2}{λ} = τ\ln 2.

This relationship between the half-life and the decay constant shows that
highly radioactive substances are quickly spent, while those that radiate
weakly endure longer. Half-lives of known radionuclides vary widely, from
more than 10¹⁹ years, such as for the very nearly stable nuclide ²⁰⁹Bi, to
10−23 seconds for highly unstable ones.

The factor of ln(2) in the above relations results from the fact that
concept of "half-life" is merely a way of selecting a different base other
than the natural base e for the lifetime expression. The time constant τ is
the e -1 -life, the time until only 1/e remains, about 36.8%, rather than
the 50% in the half-life of a radionuclide. Thus, τ is longer than t1/2.
The following equation can be shown to be valid:

N(t) = N_0 e^{-t/ τ} =N_0 2^{-t/t_{1/2}}.

Since radioactive decay is exponential with a constant probability, each
process could as easily be described with a different constant time period
that (for example) gave its "(1/3)-life" (how long until only 1/3 is left)
or "(1/10)-life" (a time period until only 10% is left), and so on. Thus,
the choice of τ and t1/2 for marker-times, are only for convenience, and
from convention. They reflect a fundamental principle only in so much as
they show that the same proportion of a given radioactive substance will
decay, during any time-period that one chooses.

Mathematically, the nth life for the above situation would be found in the
same way as above—by setting N = N₀/n, t = T1/n and substituting into the
decay solution to obtain

t_{1/n} = \frac{\ln n}{λ} = τ\ln n.

Example

A sample of ¹⁴C has a half-life of 5,730 years and a decay rate of 14
disintegration per minute (dpm) per gram of natural carbon.

If an artifact is found to have radioactivity of 4 dpm per gram of its
present C, we can find the approximate age of the object using the above
equation:

N = N_0 e^{-t/ τ},

where: \frac{N}{ N₀} = 4/14 ≈0.286,

τ= \frac{T_{1/2}}{\ln 2} ≈8267
t = -τ \ln \frac{N}{ N₀} ≈10360

Changing decay rates

The radioactive decay modes of electron capture and internal conversion are
known to be slightly sensitive to chemical and environmental effects that
change the electronic structure of the atom, which in turn affects the
presence of 1s and 2s electrons that participate in the decay process. A
small number of mostly light nuclides are affected. For example, chemical
bonds can affect the rate of electron capture to a small degree (in
general, less than 1%) depending on the proximity of electrons to the
nucleus. In ⁷Be, a difference of 0.9% has been observed between half-lives
in metallic and insulating environments.²¹ This relatively large effect is
because beryllium is a small atom whose valence electrons are in 2s atomic
orbitals, which are subject to electron capture in ⁷Be because (like all s
atomic orbitals in all atoms) they naturally penetrate into the nucleus.

In 1992, Jung et al. of the Darmstadt Heavy-Ion Research group observed an
accelerated β decay of ¹⁶³Dy⁶⁶⁺. Although neutral ¹⁶³Dy is a stable
isotope, the fully ionized ¹⁶³Dy⁶⁶⁺ undergoes β decay into the K and L
shells with a half-life of 47 days.²²

Rhenium-187 is another spectacular example. ¹⁸⁷Re normally beta decays to
¹⁸⁷Os with a half-life of 41.6 × 10⁹ years,²³ but studies using fully
ionised ¹⁸⁷Re atoms (bare nuclei) have found that this can decrease to only
33 years. This is attributed to "bound-state β− decay" of the fully ionised
atom – the electron is emitted into the "K-shell" (1s atomic orbital),
which cannot occur for neutral atoms in which all low-lying bound states
are occupied.²⁴

A number of experiments have found that decay rates of other modes of
artificial and naturally occurring radioisotopes are, to a high degree of
precision, unaffected by external conditions such as temperature, pressure,
the chemical environment, and electric, magnetic, or gravitational
fields.²⁵ Comparison of laboratory experiments over the last century,
studies of the Oklo natural nuclear reactor (which exemplified the effects
of thermal neutrons on nuclear decay), and astrophysical observations of
the luminosity decays of distant supernovae (which occurred far away so the
light has taken a great deal of time to reach us), for example, strongly
indicate that unperturbed decay rates have been constant (at least to
within the limitations of small experimental errors) as a function of time
as well.

Recent results suggest the possibility that decay rates might have a weak
dependence on environmental factors. It has been suggested that
measurements of decay rates of silicon-32, manganese-54, and radium-226
exhibit small seasonal variations (of the order of 0.1%),²⁶ ²⁷ ²⁸ while the
decay of Radon-222 exhibit large 4% peak-to-peak seasonal variations,²⁹
proposed to be related to either solar flare activity or distance from the
Sun. However, such measurements are highly susceptible to systematic
errors, and a subsequent paper³⁰ has found no evidence for such
correlations in seven other isotopes (²²Na, ⁴⁴Ti, ¹⁰⁸Ag, ¹²¹Sn, ¹³³Ba,
²⁴¹Am, ²³⁸Pu), and sets upper limits on the size of any such effects.

Theoretical basis of decay phenomena

The neutrons and protons that constitute nuclei, as well as other particles
that approach close enough to them, are governed by several interactions.
The strong nuclear force, not observed at the familiar macroscopic scale,
is the most powerful force over subatomic distances. The electrostatic
force is almost always significant, and, in the case of beta decay, the
weak nuclear force is also involved.

The interplay of these forces produces a number of different phenomena in
which energy may be released by rearrangement of particles in the nucleus,
or else the change of one type of particle into others. These
rearrangements and transformations may be hindered energetically, so that
they do not occur immediately. In certain cases, random quantum vacuum
fluctuations are theorized to promote relaxation to a lower energy state
(the "decay") in a phenomenon known as quantum tunneling. Radioactive decay
half-life of nuclides has been measured over timescales of 55 orders of
magnitude, from 2.3 x 10−23 seconds (for hydrogen-7) to 6.9 x 10³¹ seconds
(for tellurium-128).³¹ The limits of these timescales are set by the
sensitivity of instrumentation only, and there are no known natural limits
to how brief or long a decay half life for radioactive decay of a
radionuclide may be.

The decay process, like all hindered energy transformations, may be
analogized by a snowfield on a mountain. While friction between the ice
crystals may be supporting the snow's weight, the system is inherently
unstable with regard to a state of lower potential energy. A disturbance
would thus facilitate the path to a state of greater entropy: The system
will move towards the ground state, producing heat, and the total energy
will be distributable over a larger number of quantum states. Thus, an
avalanche results. The total energy does not change in this process, but,
because of the second law of thermodynamics, avalanches have only been
observed in one direction and that is toward the "ground state" — the state
with the largest number of ways in which the available energy could be
distributed.

Such a collapse (a decay event) requires a specific activation energy. For
a snow avalanche, this energy comes as a disturbance from outside the
system, although such disturbances can be arbitrarily small. In the case of
an excited atomic nucleus, the arbitrarily small disturbance comes from
quantum vacuum fluctuations. A radioactive nucleus (or any excited system
in quantum mechanics) is unstable, and can, thus, spontaneously stabilize
to a less-excited system. The resulting transformation alters the structure
of the nucleus and results in the emission of either a photon or a
high-velocity particle that has mass (such as an electron, alpha particle,
or other type).

Occurrence and applications

According to the Big Bang theory, stable isotopes of the lightest five
elements (H, He, and traces of Li, Be, and B) were produced very shortly
after the emergence of the universe, in a process called Big Bang
nucleosynthesis. These lightest stable nuclides (including deuterium)
survive to today, but any radioactive isotopes of the light elements
produced in the Big Bang (such as tritium) have long since decayed.
Isotopes of elements heavier than boron were not produced at all in the Big
Bang, and these first five elements do not have any long-lived
radioisotopes. Thus, all radioactive nuclei are, therefore, relatively
young with respect to the birth of the universe, having formed later in
various other types of nucleosynthesis in stars (in particular,
supernovae), and also during ongoing interactions between stable isotopes
and energetic particles. For example, carbon-14, a radioactive nuclide with
a half-life of only 5,730 years, is constantly produced in Earth's upper
atmosphere due to interactions between cosmic rays and nitrogen.

Nuclides that are produced by radioactive decay are called radiogenic
nuclides, whether they themselves are stable or not. There exist stable
radiogenic nuclides that were formed from short-lived extinct radionuclides
in the early solar system.³² ³³ The extra presence of these stable
radiogenic nuclides (such as Xe-129 from primordial I-129) against the
background of primordial stable nuclides can be inferred by various means.

Radioactive decay has been put to use in the technique of radioisotopic
labeling, which is used to track the passage of a chemical substance
through a complex system (such as a living organism). A sample of the
substance is synthesized with a high concentration of unstable atoms. The
presence of the substance in one or another part of the system is
determined by detecting the locations of decay events.

On the premise that radioactive decay is truly random (rather than merely
chaotic), it has been used in hardware random-number generators. Because
the process is not thought to vary significantly in mechanism over time, it
is also a valuable tool in estimating the absolute ages of certain
materials. For geological materials, the radioisotopes and some of their
decay products become trapped when a rock solidifies, and can then later be
used (subject to many well-known qualifications) to estimate the date of
the solidification. These include checking the results of several
simultaneous processes and their products against each other, within the
same sample. In a similar fashion, and also subject to qualification, the
rate of formation of carbon-14 in various eras, the date of formation of
organic matter within a certain period related to the isotope's half-life
may be estimated, because the carbon-14 becomes trapped when the organic
matter grows and incorporates the new carbon-14 from the air. Thereafter,
the amount of carbon-14 in organic matter decreases according to decay
processes that may also be independently cross-checked by other means (such
as checking the carbon-14 in individual tree rings, for example).

Origins of radioactive nuclides

Main article: nucleosynthesis

Radioactive primordial nuclides found in the Earth are residues from
ancient supernova explosions which occurred before the formation of the
solar system. They are the long-lived fraction of radionuclides surviving
in the primordial solar nebula through planet accretion until the present.
The naturally occurring short-lived radiogenic radionuclides found in rocks
are the daughters of these radioactive primordial nuclides. Another minor
source of naturally occurring radioactive nuclides are cosmogenic nuclides,
formed by cosmic ray bombardment of material in the Earth's atmosphere or
crust. The radioactive decay of these radionuclides in rocks within Earth's
mantle and crust contribute significantly to Earth's internal heat budget.

Decay chains and multiple modes

The daughter nuclide of a decay event may also be unstable (radioactive).
In this case, it will also decay, producing radiation. The resulting second
daughter nuclide may also be radioactive. This can lead to a sequence of
several decay events. Eventually, a stable nuclide is produced. This is
called a decay chain (see this article for specific details of important
natural decay chains).

An example is the natural decay chain of ²³⁸U, which is as follows:

- decays, through alpha-emission, with a half-life of 4.5 billion years to
  thorium-234
- which decays, through beta-emission, with a half-life of 24 days to
  protactinium-234
- which decays, through beta-emission, with a half-life of 1.2 minutes to
  uranium-234
- which decays, through alpha-emission, with a half-life of 240 thousand
  years to thorium-230
- which decays, through alpha-emission, with a half-life of 77 thousand
  years to radium-226
- which decays, through alpha-emission, with a half-life of 1.6 thousand
  years to radon-222
- which decays, through alpha-emission, with a half-life of 3.8 days to
  polonium-218
- which decays, through alpha-emission, with a half-life of 3.1 minutes to
  lead-214
- which decays, through beta-emission, with a half-life of 27 minutes to
  bismuth-214
- which decays, through beta-emission, with a half-life of 20 minutes to
  polonium-214
- which decays, through alpha-emission, with a half-life of 160
  microseconds to lead-210
- which decays, through beta-emission, with a half-life of 22 years to
  bismuth-210
- which decays, through beta-emission, with a half-life of 5 days to
  polonium-210
- which decays, through alpha-emission, with a half-life of 140 days to
  lead-206, which is a stable nuclide.

Some radionuclides may have several different paths of decay. For example,
approximately 36% of bismuth-212 decays, through alpha-emission, to
thallium-208 while approximately 64% of bismuth-212 decays, through
beta-emission, to polonium-212. Both thallium-208 and polonium-212 are
radioactive daughter products of bismuth-212, and both decay directly to
stable lead-208.

Solar System

This article is about the Sun and its planetary system. For other similar
systems, see Star system and Planetary system.

The Solar System[lower-alpha 1] comprises the Sun and the planetary system
that orbits it, either directly or indirectly.[lower-alpha 2] Of those
objects that orbit the Sun directly, the largest eight are the
planets,[lower-alpha 3] with the remainder being significantly smaller
objects, such as dwarf planets and small Solar System bodies such as comets
and asteroids.[lower-alpha 4] Of those that orbit the Sun indirectly, two
are larger than the smallest planet.

The Solar System formed 4.6 billion years ago from the gravitational
collapse of a giant interstellar molecular cloud. The vast majority of the
system's mass is in the Sun, with most of the remaining mass contained in
Jupiter. The four smaller inner planets, Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars,
are terrestrial planets, being primarily composed of rock and metal. The
four outer planets are giant planets, being substantially more massive than
the terrestrials. The two largest, Jupiter and Saturn, are gas giants,
being composed mainly of hydrogen and helium; the two outermost planets,
Uranus and Neptune, are ice giants, being composed largely of substances
with relatively high melting points compared with hydrogen and helium,
called ices, such as water, ammonia and methane. All planets have almost
circular orbits that lie within a nearly flat disc called the ecliptic.

The Solar System also contains smaller objects.[lower-alpha 4] The asteroid
belt, which lies between Mars and Jupiter, mostly contains objects
composed, like the terrestrial planets, of rock and metal. Beyond Neptune's
orbit lie the Kuiper belt and scattered disc, populations of
trans-Neptunian objects composed mostly of ices, and beyond them a newly
discovered population of sednoids. Within these populations are several
dozen to possibly tens of thousands of objects large enough to have been
rounded by their own gravity.¹⁰ Such objects are categorized as dwarf
planets. Identified dwarf planets include the asteroid Ceres and the
trans-Neptunian objects Pluto and Eris.[lower-alpha 4] In addition to these
two regions, various other small-body populations, including comets,
centaurs and interplanetary dust, freely travel between regions. Six of the
planets, at least three of the dwarf planets, and many of the smaller
bodies are orbited by natural satellites,[lower-alpha 5] usually termed
"moons" after the Moon. Each of the outer planets is encircled by planetary
rings of dust and other small objects.

The solar wind, a stream of charged particles flowing outwards from the
Sun, creates a bubble-like region in the interstellar medium known as the
heliosphere. The heliopause is the point at which pressure from the solar
wind is equal to the opposing pressure of interstellar wind; it extends out
to the edge of the scattered disc. The Oort cloud, which is believed to be
the source for long-period comets, may also exist at a distance roughly a
thousand times further than the heliosphere. The Solar System is located in
the Orion Arm, 26,000 light-years from the center of the Milky Way.

Discovery and exploration

Main article: Discovery and exploration of the Solar System

For many thousands of years, humanity, with a few notable exceptions, did
not recognize or understand the concept of the Solar System. Most people up
to the Late Middle Ages-Renaissance believed Earth to be stationary at the
centre of the universe and categorically different from the divine or
ethereal objects that moved through the sky. Although the Greek philosopher
Aristarchus of Samos had speculated on a heliocentric reordering of the
cosmos, Nicolaus Copernicus was the first to develop a mathematically
predictive heliocentric system.¹¹ ¹² In the 17th century, Galileo Galilei,
Johannes Kepler, and Isaac Newton developed an understanding of physics
that led to the gradual acceptance of the idea that Earth moves around the
Sun and that the planets are governed by the same physical laws that
governed Earth. The invention of the telescope led to the discovery of
further planets and moons. Improvements in the telescope and the use of
unmanned spacecraft have enabled the investigation of geological phenomena,
such as mountains, craters, seasonal meteorological phenomena, such as
clouds, dust storms and ice caps on the other planets.

Structure and composition

The principal component of the Solar System is the Sun, a G2 main-sequence
star that contains 99.86% of the system's known mass and dominates it
gravitationally.¹³ The Sun's four largest orbiting bodies, the giant
planets, account for 99% of the remaining mass, with Jupiter and Saturn
together comprising more than 90%. The remaining objects of the Solar
System (including the four terrestrial planets, the dwarf planets, moons,
asteroids, and comets) together comprise less than 0.002% of the Solar
System's total mass.[lower-alpha 6]

Most large objects in orbit around the Sun lie near the plane of Earth's
orbit, known as the ecliptic. The planets are very close to the ecliptic,
whereas comets and Kuiper belt objects are frequently at significantly
greater angles to it.¹⁷ ¹⁸ All the planets and most other objects orbit the
Sun in the same direction that the Sun is rotating (counter-clockwise, as
viewed from above Earth's north pole).¹⁹ There are exceptions, such as
Halley's Comet.

The overall structure of the charted regions of the Solar System consists
of the Sun, four relatively small inner planets surrounded by a belt of
mostly rocky asteroids, and four giant planets surrounded by the Kuiper
belt of mostly icy objects. Astronomers sometimes informally divide this
structure into separate regions. The inner Solar System includes the four
terrestrial planets and the asteroid belt. The outer Solar System is beyond
the asteroids, including the four giant planets.²⁰ Since the discovery of
the Kuiper belt, the outermost parts of the Solar System are considered a
distinct region consisting of the objects beyond Neptune.²¹

Most of the planets in the Solar System possess secondary systems of their
own, being orbited by planetary objects called natural satellites, or moons
(two of which are larger than the planet Mercury), and, in the case of the
four giant planets, by planetary rings, thin bands of tiny particles that
orbit them in unison. Most of the largest natural satellites are in
synchronous rotation, with one face permanently turned toward their parent.

All planets of the Solar System lie very close to the ecliptic. The closer
they are to the Sun, the faster they travel (inner planets on the left, all
planets except Neptune on the right).

Kepler's laws of planetary motion describe the orbits of objects about the
Sun. Following Kepler's laws, each object travels along an ellipse with the
Sun at one focus. Objects closer to the Sun (with smaller semi-major axes)
travel more quickly because they are more affected by the Sun's gravity. On
an elliptical orbit, a body's distance from the Sun varies over the course
of its year. A body's closest approach to the Sun is called its perihelion,
whereas its most distant point from the Sun is called its aphelion. The
orbits of the planets are nearly circular, but many comets, asteroids, and
Kuiper belt objects follow highly elliptical orbits. The positions of the
bodies in the Solar System can be predicted using numerical models.

Although the Sun dominates the system by mass, it accounts for only about
2% of the angular momentum.²² ²³ The planets, dominated by Jupiter, account
for most of the rest of the angular momentum due to the combination of
their mass, orbit, and distance from the Sun, with a possibly significant
contribution from comets.²²

The Sun, which comprises nearly all the matter in the Solar System, is
composed of roughly 98% hydrogen and helium.²⁴ Jupiter and Saturn, which
comprise nearly all the remaining matter, possess atmospheres composed of
roughly 99% of these elements.²⁵ ²⁶ A composition gradient exists in the
Solar System, created by heat and light pressure from the Sun; those
objects closer to the Sun, which are more affected by heat and light
pressure, are composed of elements with high melting points. Objects
farther from the Sun are composed largely of materials with lower melting
points.²⁷ The boundary in the Solar System beyond which those volatile
substances could condense is known as the frost line, and it lies at
roughly 5 AU from the Sun.⁵

The objects of the inner Solar System are composed mostly of rock,²⁸ the
collective name for compounds with high melting points, such as silicates,
iron or nickel, that remained solid under almost all conditions in the
protoplanetary nebula.²⁹ Jupiter and Saturn are composed mainly of gases,
the astronomical term for materials with extremely low melting points and
high vapour pressure, such as hydrogen, helium, and neon, which were always
in the gaseous phase in the nebula.²⁹ Ices, like water, methane, ammonia,
hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide,²⁸ have melting points up to a few
hundred kelvins.²⁹ They can be found as ices, liquids, or gases in various
places in the Solar System, whereas in the nebula they were either in the
solid or gaseous phase.²⁹ Icy substances comprise the majority of the
satellites of the giant planets, as well as most of Uranus and Neptune (the
so-called "ice giants") and the numerous small objects that lie beyond
Neptune's orbit.²⁸ ³⁰ Together, gases and ices are referred to as
volatiles.³¹

Distances and scales

The distance from Earth to the Sun is 1 astronomical unit (150,000,000 km),
or AU. For comparison, the radius of the Sun is 0.0047 AU (700,000 km).
Thus, the Sun occupies 0.00001% (10−5 %) of the volume of a sphere with a
radius the size of Earth's orbit, whereas Earth's volume is roughly one
millionth (10−6) that of the Sun. Jupiter, the largest planet, is 5.2
astronomical units (780,000,000 km) from the Sun and has a radius of 71,000
km (0.00047 AU), whereas the most distant planet, Neptune, is 30 AU
(4.5×10⁹ km) from the Sun.

With a few exceptions, the farther a planet or belt is from the Sun, the
larger the distance between its orbit and the orbit of the next nearer
object to the Sun. For example, Venus is approximately 0.33 AU farther out
from the Sun than Mercury, whereas Saturn is 4.3 AU out from Jupiter, and
Neptune lies 10.5 AU out from Uranus. Attempts have been made to determine
a relationship between these orbital distances (for example, the
Titius–Bode law),³² but no such theory has been accepted. The images at the
beginning of this section show the orbits of the various constituents of
the Solar System on different scales.

Some Solar System models attempt to convey the relative scales involved in
the Solar System on human terms. Some are small in scale (and may be
mechanical—called orreries)—whereas others extend across cities or regional
areas.³³ The largest such scale model, the Sweden Solar System, uses the
110-metre (361-ft) Ericsson Globe in Stockholm as its substitute Sun, and,
following the scale, Jupiter is a 7.5-metre (25-foot) sphere at Arlanda
International Airport, 40 km (25 mi) away, whereas the farthest current
object, Sedna, is a 10-cm (4-in) sphere in Luleå, 912 km (567 mi) away.³⁴
³⁵

If the Sun–Neptune distance is scaled to 100 metres, then the Sun would be
about 3 cm in diameter (roughly two-thirds the diameter of a golf ball),
the giant planets would be all smaller than about 3 mm, and Earth's
diameter along with the that of the other terrestrial planets would be
smaller than a flea (0.3 mm) at this scale.³⁶

Formation and evolution

Main article: Formation and evolution of the Solar System

The Solar System formed 4.568 billion years ago from the gravitational
collapse of a region within a large molecular cloud.[lower-alpha 7] This
initial cloud was likely several light-years across and probably birthed
several stars.³⁷ As is typical of molecular clouds, this one consisted
mostly of hydrogen, with some helium, and small amounts of heavier elements
fused by previous generations of stars. As the region that would become the
Solar System, known as the pre-solar nebula,³⁸ collapsed, conservation of
angular momentum caused it to rotate faster. The centre, where most of the
mass collected, became increasingly hotter than the surrounding disc.³⁷ As
the contracting nebula rotated faster, it began to flatten into a
protoplanetary disc with a diameter of roughly 200 AU³⁷ and a hot, dense
protostar at the centre.³⁹ ⁴⁰ The planets formed by accretion from this
disc,⁴¹ in which dust and gas gravitationally attracted each other,
coalescing to form ever larger bodies. Hundreds of protoplanets may have
existed in the early Solar System, but they either merged or were
destroyed, leaving the planets, dwarf planets, and leftover minor bodies.

Due to their higher boiling points, only metals and silicates could exist
in solid form in the warm inner Solar System close to the Sun, and these
would eventually form the rocky planets of Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars.
Because metallic elements only comprised a very small fraction of the solar
nebula, the terrestrial planets could not grow very large. The giant
planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune) formed further out, beyond
the frost line, the point between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter where
material is cool enough for volatile icy compounds to remain solid. The
ices that formed these planets were more plentiful than the metals and
silicates that formed the terrestrial inner planets, allowing them to grow
massive enough to capture large atmospheres of hydrogen and helium, the
lightest and most abundant elements. Leftover debris that never became
planets congregated in regions such as the asteroid belt, Kuiper belt, and
Oort cloud. The Nice model is an explanation for the creation of these
regions and how the outer planets could have formed in different positions
and migrated to their current orbits through various gravitational
interactions.

Within 50 million years, the pressure and density of hydrogen in the centre
of the protostar became great enough for it to begin thermonuclear
fusion.⁴² The temperature, reaction rate, pressure, and density increased
until hydrostatic equilibrium was achieved: the thermal pressure equalled
the force of gravity. At this point, the Sun became a main-sequence star.⁴³
The main-sequence phase, from beginning to end, will last about 10 billion
years for the Sun compared to around two billion years for all other phases
of the Sun's pre-remnant life combined.⁴⁴ Solar wind from the Sun created
the heliosphere and swept away the remaining gas and dust from the
protoplanetary disc into interstellar space, ending the planetary formation
process. The Sun is growing brighter; early in its main-sequence life its
brightness was 70% that of what it is today.⁴⁵

The Solar System will remain roughly as we know it today until the hydrogen
in the core of the Sun has been entirely converted to helium, which will
occur roughly 5 billion years from now. This will mark the end of the Sun's
main-sequence life. At this time, the core of the Sun will collapse, and
the energy output will be much greater than at present. The outer layers of
the Sun will expand to roughly 260 times its current diameter, and the Sun
will become a red giant. Because of its vastly increased surface area, the
surface of the Sun will be considerably cooler (2,600 K at its coolest)
than it is on the main sequence.⁴⁴ The expanding Sun is expected to
vaporize Mercury and Venus and render Earth uninhabitable as the habitable
zone moves out to the orbit of Mars. Eventually, the core will be hot
enough for helium fusion; the Sun will burn helium for a fraction of the
time it burned hydrogen in the core. The Sun is not massive enough to
commence the fusion of heavier elements, and nuclear reactions in the core
will dwindle. Its outer layers will move away into space, leaving a white
dwarf, an extraordinarily dense object, half the original mass of the Sun
but only the size of Earth.⁴⁶ The ejected outer layers will form what is
known as a planetary nebula, returning some of the material that formed the
Sun—but now enriched with heavier elements like carbon—to the interstellar
medium.

Sun

Main article: Sun

The Sun is the Solar System's star and by far its most massive component.
Its large mass (332,900 Earth masses)⁴⁷ produces temperatures and densities
in its core high enough to sustain nuclear fusion of hydrogen into helium,
making it a main-sequence star.⁴⁸ This releases an enormous amount of
energy, mostly radiated into space as electromagnetic radiation peaking in
visible light.⁴⁹

The Sun is a G2-type main-sequence star. Hotter main-sequence stars are
more luminous. The Sun's temperature is intermediate between that of the
hottest stars and that of the coolest stars. Stars brighter and hotter than
the Sun are rare, whereas substantially dimmer and cooler stars, known as
red dwarfs, make up 85% of the stars in the Milky Way.⁵⁰ ⁵¹

The Sun is a population I star; it has a higher abundance of elements
heavier than hydrogen and helium ("metals" in astronomical parlance) than
the older population II stars.⁵² Elements heavier than hydrogen and helium
were formed in the cores of ancient and exploding stars, so the first
generation of stars had to die before the Universe could be enriched with
these atoms. The oldest stars contain few metals, whereas stars born later
have more. This high metallicity is thought to have been crucial to the
Sun's development of a planetary system because the planets form from the
accretion of "metals".⁵³

Interplanetary medium

Main articles: Interplanetary medium and Solar wind

The vast majority of the Solar System consists of a near-vacuum known as
the interplanetary medium. Along with light, the Sun radiates a continuous
stream of charged particles (a plasma) known as the solar wind. This stream
of particles spreads outwards at roughly 1.5 million kilometres per hour,⁵⁴
creating a tenuous atmosphere that permeates the interplanetary medium out
to at least 100 AU (see § Heliosphere).⁵⁵ Activity on the Sun's surface,
such as solar flares and coronal mass ejections, disturb the heliosphere,
creating space weather and causing geomagnetic storms.⁵⁶ The largest
structure within the heliosphere is the heliospheric current sheet, a
spiral form created by the actions of the Sun's rotating magnetic field on
the interplanetary medium.⁵⁷ ⁵⁸

Earth's magnetic field stops its atmosphere from being stripped away by the
solar wind.⁵⁹ Venus and Mars do not have magnetic fields, and as a result
the solar wind is causing their atmospheres to gradually bleed away into
space.⁶⁰ Coronal mass ejections and similar events blow a magnetic field
and huge quantities of material from the surface of the Sun. The
interaction of this magnetic field and material with Earth's magnetic field
funnels charged particles into Earth's upper atmosphere, where its
interactions create aurorae seen near the magnetic poles.

The heliosphere and planetary magnetic fields (for those planets that have
them) partially shield the Solar System from high-energy interstellar
particles called cosmic rays. The density of cosmic rays in the
interstellar medium and the strength of the Sun's magnetic field change on
very long timescales, so the level of cosmic-ray penetration in the Solar
System varies, though by how much is unknown.⁶¹

The interplanetary medium is home to at least two disc-like regions of
cosmic dust. The first, the zodiacal dust cloud, lies in the inner Solar
System and causes the zodiacal light. It was likely formed by collisions
within the asteroid belt brought on by gravitational interactions with the
planets.⁶² The second dust cloud extends from about 10 AU to about 40 AU,
and was probably created by similar collisions within the Kuiper belt.⁶³ ⁶⁴

Inner Solar System

The inner Solar System is the region comprising the terrestrial planets and
the asteroid belt.⁶⁵ Composed mainly of silicates and metals, the objects
of the inner Solar System are relatively close to the Sun; the radius of
this entire region is less than the distance between the orbits of Jupiter
and Saturn. This region is also within the frost line, which is a little
less than 5 AU (about 700 million km) from the Sun.⁶⁶

Inner planets

Main article: Terrestrial planet

The four terrestrial or inner planets have dense, rocky compositions, few
or no moons, and no ring systems. They are composed largely of refractory
minerals, such as the silicates, which form their crusts and mantles, and
metals, such as iron and nickel, which form their cores. Three of the four
inner planets (Venus, Earth and Mars) have atmospheres substantial enough
to generate weather; all have impact craters and tectonic surface features,
such as rift valleys and volcanoes. The term inner planet should not be
confused with inferior planet, which designates those planets that are
closer to the Sun than Earth is (i.e. Mercury and Venus).

Mercury

Main article: Mercury (planet)
  Mercury (0.4 AU from the Sun) is the closest planet to the Sun and the
  smallest planet in the Solar System (0.055 Earth masses). Mercury has no
  natural satellites; besides impact craters, its only known geological
  features are lobed ridges or rupes that were probably produced by a
  period of contraction early in its history.⁶⁷ Mercury's very tenuous
  atmosphere consists of atoms blasted off its surface by the solar wind.⁶⁸
  Its relatively large iron core and thin mantle have not yet been
  adequately explained. Hypotheses include that its outer layers were
  stripped off by a giant impact; or, that it was prevented from fully
  accreting by the young Sun's energy.⁶⁹ ⁷⁰

Venus

Main article: Venus
  Venus (0.7 AU from the Sun) is close in size to Earth (0.815 Earth
  masses) and, like Earth, has a thick silicate mantle around an iron core,
  a substantial atmosphere, and evidence of internal geological activity.
  It is much drier than Earth, and its atmosphere is ninety times as dense.
  Venus has no natural satellites. It is the hottest planet, with surface
  temperatures over 400 °C (752°F), most likely due to the amount of
  greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.⁷¹ No definitive evidence of current
  geological activity has been detected on Venus, but it has no magnetic
  field that would prevent depletion of its substantial atmosphere, which
  suggests that its atmosphere is being replenished by volcanic
  eruptions.⁷²

Earth

Main article: Earth
  Earth (1 AU from the Sun) is the largest and densest of the inner
  planets, the only one known to have current geological activity, and the
  only place where life is known to exist.⁷³ Its liquid hydrosphere is
  unique among the terrestrial planets, and it is the only planet where
  plate tectonics has been observed. Earth's atmosphere is radically
  different from those of the other planets, having been altered by the
  presence of life to contain 21% free oxygen.⁷⁴ It has one natural
  satellite, the Moon, the only large satellite of a terrestrial planet in
  the Solar System.

Mars

Main article: Mars
  Mars (1.5 AU from the Sun) is smaller than Earth and Venus (0.107 Earth
  masses). It possesses an atmosphere of mostly carbon dioxide with a
  surface pressure of 6.1 millibars (roughly 0.6% of that of Earth).⁷⁵ Its
  surface, peppered with vast volcanoes, such as Olympus Mons, and rift
  valleys, such as Valles Marineris, shows geological activity that may
  have persisted until as recently as 2 million years ago.⁷⁶ Its red colour
  comes from iron oxide (rust) in its soil.⁷⁷ Mars has two tiny natural
  satellites (Deimos and Phobos) thought to be captured asteroids.⁷⁸

Asteroid belt

Main article: Asteroid belt

Asteroids except for the largest, Ceres, are classified as small Solar
System bodies[lower-alpha 4] and are composed mainly of refractory rocky
and metallic minerals, with some ice.⁷⁹ ⁸⁰ They range from a few metres to
hundreds of kilometres in size. Asteroids smaller than one meter are
usually called meteoroids and micrometeoroids (grain-sized), depending on
different, somewhat arbitrary definitions.

The asteroid belt occupies the orbit between Mars and Jupiter, between 2.3
and 3.3 AU from the Sun. It is thought to be remnants from the Solar
System's formation that failed to coalesce because of the gravitational
interference of Jupiter.⁸¹ The asteroid belt contains tens of thousands,
possibly millions, of objects over one kilometre in diameter.⁸² Despite
this, the total mass of the asteroid belt is unlikely to be more than a
thousandth of that of Earth.¹⁶ The asteroid belt is very sparsely
populated; spacecraft routinely pass through without incident.

Ceres

Main article: Ceres (dwarf planet)
  Ceres (2.77 AU) is the largest asteroid, a protoplanet, and a dwarf
  planet.[lower-alpha 4] It has a diameter of slightly under 1,000 km, and
  a mass large enough for its own gravity to pull it into a spherical
  shape. Ceres was considered a planet when it was discovered in 1801, and
  was reclassified to asteroid in the 1850s as further observations
  revealed additional asteroids.⁸³ It was classified as a dwarf planet in
  2006 when the definition of a planet was created.

Asteroid groups

  Asteroids in the asteroid belt are divided into asteroid groups and
  families based on their orbital characteristics. Asteroid moons are
  asteroids that orbit larger asteroids. They are not as clearly
  distinguished as planetary moons, sometimes being almost as large as
  their partners. The asteroid belt also contains main-belt comets, which
  may have been the source of Earth's water.⁸⁴
  Jupiter trojans are located in either of Jupiter's L₄ or L₅ points
  (gravitationally stable regions leading and trailing a planet in its
  orbit); the term "trojan" is also used for small bodies in any other
  planetary or satellite Lagrange point. Hilda asteroids are in a 2:3
  resonance with Jupiter; that is, they go around the Sun three times for
  every two Jupiter orbits.⁸⁵
  The inner Solar System is also dusted with near-Earth asteroids, many of
  which cross the orbits of the inner planets.⁸⁶ Some of them are
  potentially hazardous objects.

Outer Solar System

The outer region of the Solar System is home to the giant planets and their
large moons. The centaurs and many short-period comets also orbit in this
region. Due to their greater distance from the Sun, the solid objects in
the outer Solar System contain a higher proportion of volatiles, such as
water, ammonia, and methane than those of the inner Solar System because
the lower temperatures allow these compounds to remain solid.

Outer planets

Main articles: Outer planets and Giant planet

The four outer planets, or giant planets (sometimes called Jovian planets),
collectively make up 99% of the mass known to orbit the Sun.[lower-alpha 6]
Jupiter and Saturn are each many tens of times the mass of Earth and
consist overwhelmingly of hydrogen and helium; Uranus and Neptune are far
less massive (<20 Earth masses) and possess more ices in their makeup. For
these reasons, some astronomers suggest they belong in their own category,
"ice giants".⁸⁷ All four giant planets have rings, although only Saturn's
ring system is easily observed from Earth. The term superior planet
designates planets outside Earth's orbit and thus includes both the outer
planets and Mars.

Jupiter

Main article: Jupiter
  Jupiter (5.2 AU), at 318 Earth masses, is 2.5 times the mass of all the
  other planets put together. It is composed largely of hydrogen and
  helium. Jupiter's strong internal heat creates semi-permanent features in
  its atmosphere, such as cloud bands and the Great Red Spot. Jupiter has
  67 known satellites. The four largest, Ganymede, Callisto, Io, and
  Europa, show similarities to the terrestrial planets, such as volcanism
  and internal heating.⁸⁸ Ganymede, the largest satellite in the Solar
  System, is larger than Mercury.

Saturn

Main article: Saturn
  Saturn (9.5 AU), distinguished by its extensive ring system, has several
  similarities to Jupiter, such as its atmospheric composition and
  magnetosphere. Although Saturn has 60% of Jupiter's volume, it is less
  than a third as massive, at 95 Earth masses, making it the least dense
  planet in the Solar System.⁸⁹ The rings of Saturn are made up of small
  ice and rock particles. Saturn has 62 confirmed satellites; two of which,
  Titan and Enceladus, show signs of geological activity, though they are
  largely made of ice.⁹⁰ Titan, the second-largest moon in the Solar
  System, is larger than Mercury and the only satellite in the Solar System
  with a substantial atmosphere.

Uranus

Main article: Uranus
  Uranus (19.2 AU), at 14 Earth masses, is the lightest of the outer
  planets. Uniquely among the planets, it orbits the Sun on its side; its
  axial tilt is over ninety degrees to the ecliptic. It has a much colder
  core than the other giant planets and radiates very little heat into
  space.⁹¹ Uranus has 27 known satellites, the largest ones being Titania,
  Oberon, Umbriel, Ariel, and Miranda.

Neptune

Main article: Neptune
  Neptune (30.1 AU), though slightly smaller than Uranus, is more massive
  (equivalent to 17 Earths) and hence more dense. It radiates more internal
  heat, but not as much as Jupiter or Saturn.⁹² Neptune has 14 known
  satellites. The largest, Triton, is geologically active, with geysers of
  liquid nitrogen.⁹³ Triton is the only large satellite with a retrograde
  orbit. Neptune is accompanied in its orbit by several minor planets,
  termed Neptune trojans, that are in 1:1 resonance with it.

Centaurs

Main article: Centaur (minor planet)

The centaurs are icy comet-like bodies whose orbits have semi-major axes
greater than Jupiter's (5.5 AU) and less than Neptune's (30 AU). The
largest known centaur, 10199 Chariklo, has a diameter of about 250 km.⁹⁴
The first centaur discovered, 2060 Chiron, has also been classified as
comet (95P) because it develops a coma just as comets do when they approach
the Sun.⁹⁵

Comets

Main article: Comet

Comets are small Solar System bodies,[lower-alpha 4] typically only a few
kilometres across, composed largely of volatile ices. They have highly
eccentric orbits, generally a perihelion within the orbits of the inner
planets and an aphelion far beyond Pluto. When a comet enters the inner
Solar System, its proximity to the Sun causes its icy surface to sublimate
and ionise, creating a coma: a long tail of gas and dust often visible to
the naked eye.

Short-period comets have orbits lasting less than two hundred years.
Long-period comets have orbits lasting thousands of years. Short-period
comets are believed to originate in the Kuiper belt, whereas long-period
comets, such as Hale–Bopp, are believed to originate in the Oort cloud.
Many comet groups, such as the Kreutz Sungrazers, formed from the breakup
of a single parent.⁹⁶ Some comets with hyperbolic orbits may originate
outside the Solar System, but determining their precise orbits is
difficult.⁹⁷ Old comets that have had most of their volatiles driven out by
solar warming are often categorised as asteroids.⁹⁸

Trans-Neptunian region

Beyond the orbit of Neptune lies the area of the "trans-Neptunian region",
with the doughnut-shaped Kuiper belt, home of Pluto and several other dwarf
planets, and an overlapping disc of scattered objects, which is tilted
toward the plane of the Solar System and reaches much further out than the
Kuiper belt. The entire region is still largely unexplored. It appears to
consist overwhelmingly of many thousands of small worlds—the largest having
a diameter only a fifth that of Earth and a mass far smaller than that of
the Moon—composed mainly of rock and ice. This region is sometimes
described as the "third zone of the Solar System", enclosing the inner and
the outer Solar System.⁹⁹

Kuiper belt

Main article: Kuiper belt

The Kuiper belt is a great ring of debris similar to the asteroid belt, but
consisting mainly of objects composed primarily of ice.¹⁰⁰ It extends
between 30 and 50 AU from the Sun. Though it is estimated to contain
anything from dozens to thousands of dwarf planets, it is composed mainly
of small Solar System bodies. Many of the larger Kuiper belt objects, such
as Quaoar, Varuna, and Orcus, may prove to be dwarf planets with further
data. There are estimated to be over 100,000 Kuiper belt objects with a
diameter greater than 50 km, but the total mass of the Kuiper belt is
thought to be only a tenth or even a hundredth the mass of Earth.¹⁵ Many
Kuiper belt objects have multiple satellites,¹⁰¹ and most have orbits that
take them outside the plane of the ecliptic.¹⁰²

The Kuiper belt can be roughly divided into the "classical" belt and the
resonances.¹⁰⁰ Resonances are orbits linked to that of Neptune (e.g. twice
for every three Neptune orbits, or once for every two). The first resonance
begins within the orbit of Neptune itself. The classical belt consists of
objects having no resonance with Neptune, and extends from roughly 39.4 AU
to 47.7 AU.¹⁰³ Members of the classical Kuiper belt are classified as
cubewanos, after the first of their kind to be discovered, (15760) 1992
QB1, and are still in near primordial, low-eccentricity orbits.¹⁰⁴

Pluto and Charon

Main articles: Pluto and Charon (moon)
  The dwarf planet Pluto (39 AU average) is the largest known object in the
  Kuiper belt. When discovered in 1930, it was considered to be the ninth
  planet; this changed in 2006 with the adoption of a formal definition of
  planet. Pluto has a relatively eccentric orbit inclined 17 degrees to the
  ecliptic plane and ranging from 29.7 AU from the Sun at perihelion
  (within the orbit of Neptune) to 49.5 AU at aphelion. Pluto has a 3:2
  resonance with Neptune, meaning that Pluto orbits twice round the Sun for
  every three Neptunian orbits. Kuiper belt objects whose orbits share this
  resonance are called plutinos.¹⁰⁵
  Charon, the largest of Pluto's moons, is sometimes described as part of a
  binary system with Pluto, as the two bodies orbit a barycentre of gravity
  above their surfaces (i.e. they appear to "orbit each other"). Beyond
  Charon, four much smaller moons, Styx, Nix, Kerberos, and Hydra, orbit
  within the system.

Makemake and Haumea

Main articles: Makemake and Haumea
  Makemake (45.79 AU average), although smaller than Pluto, is the largest
  known object in the classical Kuiper belt (that is, a Kuiper belt object
  not in a confirmed resonance with Neptune). Makemake is the brightest
  object in the Kuiper belt after Pluto. It was named and designated a
  dwarf planet in 2008.⁷ Its orbit is far more inclined than Pluto's, at
  29°.¹⁰⁶
  Haumea (43.13 AU average) is in an orbit similar to Makemake except that
  it is in a 7:12 orbital resonance with Neptune.¹⁰⁷ It is about the same
  size as Makemake and has two natural satellites. A rapid, 3.9-hour
  rotation gives it a flattened and elongated shape. It was named and
  designated a dwarf planet in 2008.¹⁰⁸

Scattered disc

Main article: Scattered disc

The scattered disc, which overlaps the Kuiper belt but extends much further
outwards, is thought to be the source of short-period comets. Scattered
disc objects are believed to have been ejected into erratic orbits by the
gravitational influence of Neptune's early outward migration. Most
scattered disc objects (SDOs) have perihelia within the Kuiper belt but
aphelia far beyond it (some more than 150 AU from the Sun). SDOs' orbits
are also highly inclined to the ecliptic plane and are often almost
perpendicular to it. Some astronomers consider the scattered disc to be
merely another region of the Kuiper belt and describe scattered disc
objects as "scattered Kuiper belt objects".¹⁰⁹ Some astronomers also
classify centaurs as inward-scattered Kuiper belt objects along with the
outward-scattered residents of the scattered disc.¹¹⁰

Eris

Main article: Eris (dwarf planet)
  Eris (68 AU average) is the largest known scattered disc object, and
  caused a debate about what constitutes a planet, because it is 25% more
  massive than Pluto¹¹¹ and about the same diameter. It is the most massive
  of the known dwarf planets. It has one known moon, Dysnomia. Like Pluto,
  its orbit is highly eccentric, with a perihelion of 38.2 AU (roughly
  Pluto's distance from the Sun) and an aphelion of 97.6 AU, and steeply
  inclined to the ecliptic plane.

Farthest regions

The point at which the Solar System ends and interstellar space begins is
not precisely defined because its outer boundaries are shaped by two
separate forces: the solar wind and the Sun's gravity. The limit of the
solar wind's influence is roughly four times Pluto's distance from the Sun;
this heliopause, the outer boundary of the heliosphere, is considered the
beginning of the interstellar medium.⁵⁵ The Sun's Hill sphere, the
effective range of its gravitational dominance, is believed to extend up to
a thousand times farther and encompasses the theorized Oort cloud.¹¹²

Heliosphere

Main article: Heliosphere

The heliosphere is a stellar-wind bubble, a region of space dominated by
the Sun, which radiates at roughly 400 km/s its solar wind, a stream of
charged particles, until it collides with the wind of the interstellar
medium.

The collision occurs at the termination shock, which is roughly 80–100 AU
from the Sun upwind of the interstellar medium and roughly 200 AU from the
Sun downwind.¹¹³ Here the wind slows dramatically, condenses and becomes
more turbulent,¹¹³ forming a great oval structure known as the heliosheath.
This structure is believed to look and behave very much like a comet's
tail, extending outward for a further 40 AU on the upwind side but tailing
many times that distance downwind; evidence from the Cassini and
Interstellar Boundary Explorer spacecraft has suggested that it is forced
into a bubble shape by the constraining action of the interstellar magnetic
field.¹¹⁴

The outer boundary of the heliosphere, the heliopause, is the point at
which the solar wind finally terminates and is the beginning of
interstellar space.⁵⁵ Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 are reported to have passed
the termination shock and entered the heliosheath, at 94 and 84 AU from the
Sun, respectively.¹¹⁵ ¹¹⁶ Voyager 1 is reported to have crossed the
heliopause in August, 2012.¹¹⁷

The shape and form of the outer edge of the heliosphere is likely affected
by the fluid dynamics of interactions with the interstellar medium as well
as solar magnetic fields prevailing to the south, e.g. it is bluntly shaped
with the northern hemisphere extending 9 AU farther than the southern
hemisphere.¹¹³ Beyond the heliopause, at around 230 AU, lies the bow shock,
a plasma "wake" left by the Sun as it travels through the Milky Way.¹¹⁸

Due to a lack of data, conditions in local interstellar space are not known
for certain. It is expected that NASA's Voyager spacecraft, as they pass
the heliopause, will transmit valuable data on radiation levels and solar
wind to Earth.¹¹⁹ How well the heliosphere shields the Solar System from
cosmic rays is poorly understood. A NASA-funded team has developed a
concept of a "Vision Mission" dedicated to sending a probe to the
heliosphere.¹²⁰ ¹²¹

Detached objects

Main articles: Detached object and Sednoid

90377 Sedna (520 AU average) is a large, reddish object with a gigantic,
highly elliptical orbit that takes it from about 76 AU at perihelion to 940
AU at aphelion and takes 11,400 years to complete. Mike Brown, who
discovered the object in 2003, asserts that it cannot be part of the
scattered disc or the Kuiper belt because its perihelion is too distant to
have been affected by Neptune's migration. He and other astronomers
consider it to be the first in an entirely new population, sometimes termed
"distant detached objects" (DDOs), which also may include the object 2000
CR₁₀₅, which has a perihelion of 45 AU, an aphelion of 415 AU, and an
orbital period of 3,420 years.¹²² Brown terms this population the "inner
Oort cloud" because it may have formed through a similar process, although
it is far closer to the Sun.¹²³ Sedna is very likely a dwarf planet, though
its shape has yet to be determined. The second unequivocally detached
object, with a perihelion farther than Sedna's at roughly 81 AU, is 2012
VP113, discovered in 2012. Its aphelion is only half that of Sedna's, at
400–500 AU.¹²⁴ ¹²⁵

Oort cloud

Main article: Oort cloud

The Oort cloud is a hypothetical spherical cloud of up to a trillion icy
objects that is believed to be the source for all long-period comets and to
surround the Solar System at roughly 50,000 AU (around 1 light-year (ly)),
and possibly to as far as 100,000 AU (1.87 ly). It is believed to be
composed of comets that were ejected from the inner Solar System by
gravitational interactions with the outer planets. Oort cloud objects move
very slowly, and can be perturbed by infrequent events, such as collisions,
the gravitational effects of a passing star, or the galactic tide, the
tidal force exerted by the Milky Way.¹²⁶ ¹²⁷

Boundaries

See also: Vulcanoid and Planets beyond Neptune

Much of the Solar System is still unknown. The Sun's gravitational field is
estimated to dominate the gravitational forces of surrounding stars out to
about two light years (125,000 AU). Lower estimates for the radius of the
Oort cloud, by contrast, do not place it farther than 50,000 AU.¹²⁸ Despite
discoveries such as Sedna, the region between the Kuiper belt and the Oort
cloud, an area tens of thousands of AU in radius, is still virtually
unmapped. There are also ongoing studies of the region between Mercury and
the Sun.¹²⁹ Objects may yet be discovered in the Solar System's uncharted
regions.

Currently, the furthest known object is Comet West, at 70,000 AU at
aphelion, but as non-periodic and long-period comets begin to be tracked
better, this may change. The second-most-distant object is Comet Hyakutake,
with an aphelion of 3,410 AU.

Galactic context

Position of the Solar System within the Milky Way marked by the yellow
arrow

The Solar System is located in the Milky Way, a barred spiral galaxy with a
diameter of about 100,000 light-years containing about 200 billion
stars.¹³⁰ The Sun resides in one of the Milky Way's outer spiral arms,
known as the Orion–Cygnus Arm or Local Spur.¹³¹ The Sun lies between 25,000
and 28,000 light-years from the Galactic Centre,¹³² and its speed within
the Milky Way is about 220 km/s, so that it completes one revolution every
225–250 million years. This revolution is known as the Solar System's
galactic year.¹³³ The solar apex, the direction of the Sun's path through
interstellar space, is near the constellation Hercules in the direction of
the current location of the bright star Vega.¹³⁴ The plane of the ecliptic
lies at an angle of about 60° to the galactic plane.[lower-alpha 8]

The Solar System's location in the Milky Way is a factor in the
evolutionary history of life on Earth. Its orbit is close to circular, and
orbits near the Sun are at roughly the same speed as that of the spiral
arms.¹³⁶ ¹³⁷ Therefore, the Sun passes through arms only rarely. Because
spiral arms are home to a far larger concentration of supernovae,
gravitational instabilities, and radiation that could disrupt the Solar
System, this has given Earth long periods of stability for life to
evolve.¹³⁶ The Solar System also lies well outside the star-crowded
environs of the galactic centre. Near the centre, gravitational tugs from
nearby stars could perturb bodies in the Oort cloud and send many comets
into the inner Solar System, producing collisions with potentially
catastrophic implications for life on Earth. The intense radiation of the
galactic centre could also interfere with the development of complex
life.¹³⁶ Even at the Solar System's current location, some scientists have
speculated that recent supernovae may have adversely affected life in the
last 35,000 years, by flinging pieces of expelled stellar core towards the
Sun, as radioactive dust grains and larger, comet-like bodies.¹³⁸

Neighbourhood

The Solar System is in the Local Interstellar Cloud or Local Fluff. It is
thought to be near the neighbouring G-Cloud but it is not known if the
Solar System is embedded in the Local Interstellar Cloud, or if it is in
the region where the Local Interstellar Cloud and G-Cloud are
interacting.¹³⁹ ¹⁴⁰ The Local Interstellar Cloud is an area of denser cloud
in an otherwise sparse region known as the Local Bubble, an
hourglass-shaped cavity in the interstellar medium roughly 300 light-years
(ly) across. The bubble is suffused with high-temperature plasma, that
suggests it is the product of several recent supernovae.¹⁴¹

There are relatively few stars within ten light-years of the Sun. The
closest is the triple star system Alpha Centauri, which is about 4.4
light-years away. Alpha Centauri A and B are a closely tied pair of
Sun-like stars, whereas the small red dwarf, Proxima Centauri, orbits the
pair at a distance of 0.2 light-year. The stars next closest to the Sun are
the red dwarfs Barnard's Star (at 5.9 ly), Wolf 359 (7.8 ly), and Lalande
21185 (8.3 ly).

The largest nearby star is Sirius, a bright main-sequence star roughly 8.6
light-years away and roughly twice the Sun's mass and that is orbited by a
white dwarf, Sirius B. The nearest brown dwarfs are the binary Luhman 16
system at 6.6 light-years. Other systems within ten light-years are the
binary red-dwarf system Luyten 726-8 (8.7 ly) and the solitary red dwarf
Ross 154 (9.7 ly).¹⁴² The closest solitary Sun-like star to the Solar
System is Tau Ceti at 11.9 light-years. It has roughly 80% of the Sun's
mass but only 60% of its luminosity.¹⁴³ The closest known extrasolar planet
to the Sun orbits Alpha Centauri B. This planet, Alpha Centauri Bb, is at
least 1.1 times Earth's mass and orbits its star every 3.236 days.¹⁴⁴ The
closest known free-floating planetary-mass object to the Sun is WISE
0855−0714,¹⁴⁵ an object with a mass less than 10 Jupiter masses located
roughly 7 light-years away.

Notes

[1] Capitalization of the name varies. The IAU, the authoritative body
  regarding astronomical nomenclature, specifies capitalizing the names of
  all individual astronomical objects, but uses mixed "Solar System" and
  "solar system" in their naming guidelines document. The name is commonly
  rendered in lower case ("solar system"), as, for example, in the Oxford
  English Dictionary and Merriam-Webster's 11th Collegiate Dictionary.
[2] The moons orbiting the Solar System's planets are an example of the
  latter.
[3] Historically, several other bodies were once considered planets,
  including, from its discovery in 1930 until 2006, Pluto. See Former
  planets.
[4] According to current definitions, objects in orbit around the Sun are
  classified dynamically and physically into three categories: planets,
  dwarf planets, and small Solar System bodies.
A planet is any body in orbit around the Sun whose mass is sufficient for
  gravity to have pulled it into a (near-)spherical shape and which has
  cleared its immediate neighbourhood of all smaller objects. By this
  definition, the Solar System has eight planets: Mercury, Venus, Earth,
  Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. As it has not cleared its
  neighbourhood of other Kuiper belt objects, Pluto does not fit this
  definition.⁶
Instead, Pluto is considered to be a dwarf planet, a body orbiting the Sun
  that is massive enough to be made near-spherical by its own gravity but
  which has not cleared planetesimals from its neighbourhood and is also
  not a satellite.⁶ In addition to Pluto, the IAU has recognized four other
  dwarf planets in the Solar System: Ceres, Haumea, Makemake, and Eris.⁷
  Other objects commonly (but not officially) treated as dwarf planets
  include 2007 OR10, Sedna, Orcus, and Quaoar.⁸ In a reference to Pluto,
  other dwarf planets orbiting in the trans-Neptunian region are sometimes
  called "plutoids".⁹
The remaining objects in orbit around the Sun are known as small Solar
  System bodies.⁶
[5] See List of natural satellites of the Solar System for the full list of
  natural satellites of the eight planets and first five dwarf planets
[6] The mass of the Solar System excluding the Sun, Jupiter and Saturn can
  be determined by adding together all the calculated masses for its
  largest objects and using rough calculations for the masses of the Oort
  cloud (estimated at roughly 3 Earth masses),¹⁴ the Kuiper belt (estimated
  at roughly 0.1 Earth mass)¹⁵ and the asteroid belt (estimated to be
  0.0005 Earth mass)¹⁶ for a total, rounded upwards, of ~37 Earth masses,
  or 8.1% of the mass in orbit around the Sun. With the combined masses of
  Uranus and Neptune (~31 Earth masses) subtracted, the remaining ~6 Earth
  masses of material comprise 1.3% of the total orbiting mass.
[7] The date is based on the oldest inclusions found to date in meteorites,
  4568.2+0.2
−0.4 million years, and is thought to be the date of the formation of the
  first solid material in the collapsing nebula.

  oldest Pb–Pb age of a meteoritic inclusion". Nature Geoscience, 3,
  637–641, 2010. doi:10.1038/NGEO941
[8] If ψ is the angle between the north pole of the ecliptic and the north
  galactic pole then:\cos ψ=\cos (β_g)\cos (β_e)\cos (α_g-α_e)+\sin
  (β_g)\sin (βₑ₎
where β_g=27° 07′ 42.01″ and α_g=12h 51m 26.282 are the declination and
  right ascension of the north galactic pole,¹³⁵ whereas βₑ₌66° 33′ 38.6″
  and αₑ₌18h 0m 00 are those for the north pole of the ecliptic. (Both
  pairs of coordinates are for J2000 epoch.) The result of the calculation
  is 60.19°.

Speed of light

"Lightspeed" redirects here. For other uses, see Speed of light
(disambiguation) and Lightspeed (disambiguation).

The speed of light in vacuum, commonly denoted c, is a universal physical
constant important in many areas of physics. Its value is exactly 299792458
metres per second (≈3.00×10⁸ m/s), as the length of the metre is defined
from this constant and the international standard for time.¹ According to
special relativity, c is the maximum speed at which all matter and
information in the universe can travel. It is the speed at which all
massless particles and changes of the associated fields (including
electromagnetic radiation such as light and gravitational waves) travel in
vacuum. Such particles and waves travel at c regardless of the motion of
the source or the inertial reference frame of the observer. In the theory
of relativity, c interrelates space and time, and also appears in the
famous equation of mass–energy equivalence E = mc².²

The speed at which light propagates through transparent materials, such as
glass or air, is less than c; similarly, the speed of radio waves in wire
cables is slower than c. The ratio between c and the speed v at which light
travels in a material is called the refractive index n of the material (n =
c / v). For example, for visible light the refractive index of glass is
typically around 1.5, meaning that light in glass travels at c / 1.5 ≈
200000 km/s; the refractive index of air for visible light is about 1.0003,
so the speed of light in air is about 299700 km/s (about 90 km/s slower
than c).

For many practical purposes, light and other electromagnetic waves will
appear to propagate instantaneously, but for long distances and very
sensitive measurements, their finite speed has noticeable effects. In
communicating with distant space probes, it can take minutes to hours for a
message to get from Earth to the spacecraft, or vice versa. The light seen
from stars left them many years ago, allowing the study of the history of
the universe by looking at distant objects. The finite speed of light also
limits the theoretical maximum speed of computers, since information must
be sent within the computer from chip to chip. The speed of light can be
used with time of flight measurements to measure large distances to high
precision.

Ole Rømer first demonstrated in 1676 that light travels at a finite speed
(as opposed to instantaneously) by studying the apparent motion of
Jupiter's moon Io. In 1865, James Clerk Maxwell proposed that light was an
electromagnetic wave, and therefore travelled at the speed c appearing in
his theory of electromagnetism.³ In 1905, Albert Einstein postulated that
the speed of light with respect to any inertial frame is independent of the
motion of the light source,⁴ and explored the consequences of that
postulate by deriving the special theory of relativity and showing that the
parameter c had relevance outside of the context of light and
electromagnetism.

After centuries of increasingly precise measurements, in 1975 the speed of
light was known to be 299792458 m/s with a measurement uncertainty of 4
parts per billion. In 1983, the metre was redefined in the International
System of Units (SI) as the distance travelled by light in vacuum in
1/299792458 of a second. As a result, the numerical value of c in metres
per second is now fixed exactly by the definition of the metre.⁵

Numerical value, notation, and units

The speed of light in vacuum is usually denoted by a lowercase c, for
"constant" or the Latin celeritas (meaning "swiftness, celerity").
Historically, the symbol V was used for as an alternative symbol for the
speed of light, introduced by James Clerk Maxwell in 1865. In 1856, Wilhelm
Eduard Weber and Rudolf Kohlrausch had used c for a different constant
later shown to equal √2 times the speed of light in vacuum. In 1894, Paul
Drude redefined c with its modern meaning. Einstein used V in his original
German-language papers on special relativity in 1905, but in 1907 he
switched to c, which by then had become the standard symbol for the speed
of light.⁶ ⁷

Sometimes c is used for the speed of waves in any material medium, and c₀
for the speed of light in vacuum.⁸ This subscripted notation, which is
endorsed in official SI literature,⁵ has the same form as other related
constants: namely, μ₀ for the vacuum permeability or magnetic constant, ε₀
for the vacuum permittivity or electric constant, and Z₀ for the impedance
of free space. This article uses c exclusively for the speed of light in
vacuum.

Since 1983, the metre has been defined in the International System of Units
(SI) as the distance light travels in vacuum in ¹⁄₂₉₉₇₉₂₄₅₈ of a second.
This definition fixes the speed of light in vacuum at exactly 299792458
m/s.⁹ ¹⁰ ¹¹ As a dimensional physical constant, the numerical value of c is
different for different unit systems.[Note 2]In branches of physics in
which c appears often, such as in relativity, it is common to use systems
of natural units of measurement or the geometrized unit system where c =
1.¹³ ¹⁴ Using these units, c does not appear explicitly because
multiplication or division by 1 does not affect the result.

Fundamental role in physics

See also: Introduction to special relativity, Special relativity and
One-way speed of light

The speed at which light waves propagate in vacuum is independent both of
the motion of the wave source and of the inertial frame of reference of the
observer.[Note 3] This invariance of the speed of light was postulated by
Einstein in 1905,⁴ after being motivated by Maxwell's theory of
electromagnetism and the lack of evidence for the luminiferous aether;¹⁵ it
has since been consistently confirmed by many experiments. It is only
possible to verify experimentally that the two-way speed of light (for
example, from a source to a mirror and back again) is frame-independent,
because it is impossible to measure the one-way speed of light (for
example, from a source to a distant detector) without some convention as to
how clocks at the source and at the detector should be synchronized.
However, by adopting Einstein synchronization for the clocks, the one-way
speed of light becomes equal to the two-way speed of light by definition.¹⁴
¹⁶ The special theory of relativity explores the consequences of this
invariance of c with the assumption that the laws of physics are the same
in all inertial frames of reference.¹⁷ ¹⁸ One consequence is that c is the
speed at which all massless particles and waves, including light, must
travel in vacuum.

Special relativity has many counterintuitive and experimentally verified
implications.¹⁹ These include the equivalence of mass and energy (E = mc²),
length contraction (moving objects shorten),[Note 4] and time dilation
(moving clocks run more slowly). The factor γ by which lengths contract and
times dilate is known as the Lorentz factor and is given by γ = (1 −
v²/c²)−1/2, where v is the speed of the object. The difference of γ from 1
is negligible for speeds much slower than c, such as most everyday
speeds—in which case special relativity is closely approximated by Galilean
relativity—but it increases at relativistic speeds and diverges to infinity
as v approaches c.

The results of special relativity can be summarized by treating space and
time as a unified structure known as spacetime (with c relating the units
of space and time), and requiring that physical theories satisfy a special
symmetry called Lorentz invariance, whose mathematical formulation contains
the parameter c.²² Lorentz invariance is an almost universal assumption for
modern physical theories, such as quantum electrodynamics, quantum
chromodynamics, the Standard Model of particle physics, and general
relativity. As such, the parameter c is ubiquitous in modern physics,
appearing in many contexts that are unrelated to light. For example,
general relativity predicts that c is also the speed of gravity and of
gravitational waves.²³ ²⁴ In non-inertial frames of reference
(gravitationally curved space or accelerated reference frames), the local
speed of light is constant and equal to c, but the speed of light along a
trajectory of finite length can differ from c, depending on how distances
and times are defined.²⁵

It is generally assumed that fundamental constants such as c have the same
value throughout spacetime, meaning that they do not depend on location and
do not vary with time. However, it has been suggested in various theories
that the speed of light may have changed over time.²⁶ ²⁷ No conclusive
evidence for such changes has been found, but they remain the subject of
ongoing research.²⁸ ²⁹

It also is generally assumed that the speed of light is isotropic, meaning
that it has the same value regardless of the direction in which it is
measured. Observations of the emissions from nuclear energy levels as a
function of the orientation of the emitting nuclei in a magnetic field (see
Hughes–Drever experiment), and of rotating optical resonators (see
Resonator experiments) have put stringent limits on the possible two-way
anisotropy.³⁰ ³¹

Upper limit on speeds

According to special relativity, the energy of an object with rest mass m
and speed v is given by γmc², where γ is the Lorentz factor defined above.
When v is zero, γ is equal to one, giving rise to the famous E = mc²
formula for mass–energy equivalence. The γ factor approaches infinity as v
approaches c, and it would take an infinite amount of energy to accelerate
an object with mass to the speed of light. The speed of light is the upper
limit for the speeds of objects with positive rest mass, and individual
photons cannot travel faster than the speed of light.³² ³³ This is
experimentally established in many tests of relativistic energy and
momentum.³⁴

More generally, it is normally impossible for information or energy to
travel faster than c. One argument for this follows from the
counter-intuitive implication of special relativity known as the relativity
of simultaneity. If the spatial distance between two events A and B is
greater than the time interval between them multiplied by c then there are
frames of reference in which A precedes B, others in which B precedes A,
and others in which they are simultaneous. As a result, if something were
travelling faster than c relative to an inertial frame of reference, it
would be travelling backwards in time relative to another frame, and
causality would be violated.[Note 5]³⁶ In such a frame of reference, an
"effect" could be observed before its "cause". Such a violation of
causality has never been recorded,¹⁶ and would lead to paradoxes such as
the tachyonic antitelephone.³⁷

Faster-than-light observations and experiments

Main article: Faster-than-light
Further information: Superluminal motion

There are situations in which it may seem that matter, energy, or
information travels at speeds greater than c, but they do not. For example,
as is discussed in the propagation of light in a medium section below, many
wave velocities can exceed c. For example, the phase velocity of X-rays
through most glasses can routinely exceed c,³⁸ but phase velocity does not
determine the velocity at which waves convey information.³⁹

If a laser beam is swept quickly across a distant object, the spot of light
can move faster than c, although the initial movement of the spot is
delayed because of the time it takes light to get to the distant object at
the speed c. However, the only physical entities that are moving are the
laser and its emitted light, which travels at the speed c from the laser to
the various positions of the spot. Similarly, a shadow projected onto a
distant object can be made to move faster than c, after a delay in time.⁴⁰
In neither case does any matter, energy, or information travel faster than
light.⁴¹

The rate of change in the distance between two objects in a frame of
reference with respect to which both are moving (their closing speed) may
have a value in excess of c. However, this does not represent the speed of
any single object as measured in a single inertial frame.⁴¹

Certain quantum effects appear to be transmitted instantaneously and
therefore faster than c, as in the EPR paradox. An example involves the
quantum states of two particles that can be entangled. Until either of the
particles is observed, they exist in a superposition of two quantum states.
If the particles are separated and one particle's quantum state is
observed, the other particle's quantum state is determined instantaneously
(i.e., faster than light could travel from one particle to the other).
However, it is impossible to control which quantum state the first particle
will take on when it is observed, so information cannot be transmitted in
this manner.⁴¹ ⁴²

Another quantum effect that predicts the occurrence of faster-than-light
speeds is called the Hartman effect; under certain conditions the time
needed for a virtual particle to tunnel through a barrier is constant,
regardless of the thickness of the barrier.⁴³ ⁴⁴ This could result in a
virtual particle crossing a large gap faster-than-light. However, no
information can be sent using this effect.⁴⁵

So-called superluminal motion is seen in certain astronomical objects,⁴⁶
such as the relativistic jets of radio galaxies and quasars. However, these
jets are not moving at speeds in excess of the speed of light: the apparent
superluminal motion is a projection effect caused by objects moving near
the speed of light and approaching Earth at a small angle to the line of
sight: since the light which was emitted when the jet was farther away took
longer to reach the Earth, the time between two successive observations
corresponds to a longer time between the instants at which the light rays
were emitted.⁴⁷

In models of the expanding universe, the farther galaxies are from each
other, the faster they drift apart. This receding is not due to motion
through space, but rather to the expansion of space itself.⁴¹ For example,
galaxies far away from Earth appear to be moving away from the Earth with a
speed proportional to their distances. Beyond a boundary called the Hubble
sphere, the rate at which their distance from Earth increases becomes
greater than the speed of light.⁴⁸

Propagation of light

In classical physics, light is described as a type of electromagnetic wave.
The classical behaviour of the electromagnetic field is described by
Maxwell's equations, which predict that the speed c with which
electromagnetic waves (such as light) propagate through the vacuum is
related to the electric constant ε₀ and the magnetic constant μ₀ by the
equation c = 1/√ε₀μ₀.⁴⁹ In modern quantum physics, the electromagnetic
field is described by the theory of quantum electrodynamics (QED). In this
theory, light is described by the fundamental excitations (or quanta) of
the electromagnetic field, called photons. In QED, photons are massless
particles and thus, according to special relativity, they travel at the
speed of light in vacuum.

Extensions of QED in which the photon has a mass have been considered. In
such a theory, its speed would depend on its frequency, and the invariant
speed c of special relativity would then be the upper limit of the speed of
light in vacuum.²⁵ No variation of the speed of light with frequency has
been observed in rigorous testing,⁵⁰ ⁵¹ ⁵² putting stringent limits on the
mass of the photon. The limit obtained depends on the model used: if the
massive photon is described by Proca theory,⁵³ the experimental upper bound
for its mass is about 10−57 grams;⁵⁴ if photon mass is generated by a Higgs
mechanism, the experimental upper limit is less sharp, m ≤ 10−14 eV/c² ⁵³
(roughly 2 × 10−47 g).

Another reason for the speed of light to vary with its frequency would be
the failure of special relativity to apply to arbitrarily small scales, as
predicted by some proposed theories of quantum gravity. In 2009, the
observation of the spectrum of gamma-ray burst GRB 090510 did not find any
difference in the speeds of photons of different energies, confirming that
Lorentz invariance is verified at least down to the scale of the Planck
length (lP = √ħG/c³ ≈ 1.6163×10−35 m) divided by 1.2.⁵⁵

In a medium

See also: Refractive index

In a medium, light usually does not propagate at a speed equal to c;
further, different types of light wave will travel at different speeds. The
speed at which the individual crests and troughs of a plane wave (a wave
filling the whole space, with only one frequency) propagate is called the
phase velocity vₚ. An actual physical signal with a finite extent (a pulse
of light) travels at a different speed. The largest part of the pulse
travels at the group velocity vg, and its earliest part travels at the
front velocity vf.

The phase velocity is important in determining how a light wave travels
through a material or from one material to another. It is often represented
in terms of a refractive index. The refractive index of a material is
defined as the ratio of c to the phase velocity vₚ in the material: larger
indices of refraction indicate lower speeds. The refractive index of a
material may depend on the light's frequency, intensity, polarization, or
direction of propagation; in many cases, though, it can be treated as a
material-dependent constant. The refractive index of air is approximately
1.0003.⁵⁶ Denser media, such as water,⁵⁷ glass,⁵⁸ and diamond,⁵⁹ have
refractive indexes of around 1.3, 1.5 and 2.4, respectively, for visible
light. In exotic materials like Bose–Einstein condensates near absolute
zero, the effective speed of light may be only a few metres per second.
However, this represents absorption and re-radiation delay between atoms,
as do all slower-than-c speeds in material substances. As an extreme
example of light "slowing" in matter, two independent teams of physicists
claimed to bring light to a "complete standstill" by passing it through a
Bose–Einstein condensate of the element rubidium, one team at Harvard
University and the Rowland Institute for Science in Cambridge, Mass., and
the other at the Harvard–Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, also in
Cambridge. However, the popular description of light being "stopped" in
these experiments refers only to light being stored in the excited states
of atoms, then re-emitted at an arbitrarily later time, as stimulated by a
second laser pulse. During the time it had "stopped," it had ceased to be
light. This type of behaviour is generally microscopically true of all
transparent media which "slow" the speed of light.⁶⁰

In transparent materials, the refractive index generally is greater than 1,
meaning that the phase velocity is less than c. In other materials, it is
possible for the refractive index to become smaller than 1 for some
frequencies; in some exotic materials it is even possible for the index of
refraction to become negative.⁶¹ The requirement that causality is not
violated implies that the real and imaginary parts of the dielectric
constant of any material, corresponding respectively to the index of
refraction and to the attenuation coefficient, are linked by the
Kramers–Kronig relations.⁶² In practical terms, this means that in a
material with refractive index less than 1, the absorption of the wave is
so quick that no signal can be sent faster than c.

A pulse with different group and phase velocities (which occurs if the
phase velocity is not the same for all the frequencies of the pulse) smears
out over time, a process known as dispersion. Certain materials have an
exceptionally low (or even zero) group velocity for light waves, a
phenomenon called slow light, which has been confirmed in various
experiments.⁶³ ⁶⁴ ⁶⁵ ⁶⁶ The opposite, group velocities exceeding c, has
also been shown in experiment.⁶⁷ It should even be possible for the group
velocity to become infinite or negative, with pulses travelling
instantaneously or backwards in time.⁶⁸

None of these options, however, allow information to be transmitted faster
than c. It is impossible to transmit information with a light pulse any
faster than the speed of the earliest part of the pulse (the front
velocity). It can be shown that this is (under certain assumptions) always
equal to c.⁶⁸

It is possible for a particle to travel through a medium faster than the
phase velocity of light in that medium (but still slower than c). When a
charged particle does that in a dielectric material, the electromagnetic
equivalent of a shock wave, known as Cherenkov radiation, is emitted.⁶⁹

Practical effects of finiteness

The speed of light is of relevance to communications: the one-way and
round-trip delay time are greater than zero. This applies from small to
astronomical scales. On the other hand, some techniques depend on the
finite speed of light, for example in distance measurements.

Small scales

In supercomputers, the speed of light imposes a limit on how quickly data
can be sent between processors. If a processor operates at 1 gigahertz, a
signal can only travel a maximum of about 30 centimetres (1 ft) in a single
cycle. Processors must therefore be placed close to each other to minimize
communication latencies; this can cause difficulty with cooling. If clock
frequencies continue to increase, the speed of light will eventually become
a limiting factor for the internal design of single chips.⁷⁰

Large distances on Earth

For example, given the equatorial circumference of the Earth is about 40075
km and c about 300000 km/s, the theoretical shortest time for a piece of
information to travel half the globe along the surface is about 67
milliseconds. When light is travelling around the globe in an optical
fibre, the actual transit time is longer, in part because the speed of
light is slower by about 35% in an optical fibre, depending on its
refractive index n.⁷¹ Furthermore, straight lines rarely occur in global
communications situations, and delays are created when the signal passes
through an electronic switch or signal regenerator.⁷²

Spaceflights and astronomy

Similarly, communications between the Earth and spacecraft are not
instantaneous. There is a brief delay from the source to the receiver,
which becomes more noticeable as distances increase. This delay was
significant for communications between ground control and Apollo 8 when it
became the first manned spacecraft to orbit the Moon: for every question,
the ground control station had to wait at least three seconds for the
answer to arrive.⁷³ The communications delay between Earth and Mars can
vary between five and twenty minutes depending upon the relative positions
of the two planets. As a consequence of this, if a robot on the surface of
Mars were to encounter a problem, its human controllers would not be aware
of it until at least five minutes later, and possibly up to twenty minutes
later; it would then take a further five to twenty minutes for instructions
to travel from Earth to Mars.

NASA must wait several hours for information from a probe orbiting Jupiter,
and if it needs to correct a navigation error, the fix will not arrive at
the spacecraft for an equal amount of time, creating a risk of the
correction not arriving in time.

Receiving light and other signals from distant astronomical sources can
even take much longer. For example, it has taken 13 billion (13×10⁹) years
for light to travel to Earth from the faraway galaxies viewed in the Hubble
Ultra Deep Field images.⁷⁴ ⁷⁵ Those photographs, taken today, capture
images of the galaxies as they appeared 13 billion years ago, when the
universe was less than a billion years old.⁷⁴ The fact that more distant
objects appear to be younger, due to the finite speed of light, allows
astronomers to infer the evolution of stars, of galaxies, and of the
universe itself.

Astronomical distances are sometimes expressed in light-years, especially
in popular science publications and media.⁷⁶ A light-year is the distance
light travels in one year, around 9461 billion kilometres, 5879 billion
miles, or 0.3066 parsecs. In round figures, a light year is nearly 10
trillion kilometres or nearly 6 trillion miles. Proxima Centauri, the
closest star to Earth after the Sun, is around 4.2 light-years away.⁷⁷

Distance measurement

Main article: Distance measurement

Radar systems measure the distance to a target by the time it takes a
radio-wave pulse to return to the radar antenna after being reflected by
the target: the distance to the target is half the round-trip transit time
multiplied by the speed of light. A Global Positioning System (GPS)
receiver measures its distance to GPS satellites based on how long it takes
for a radio signal to arrive from each satellite, and from these distances
calculates the receiver's position. Because light travels about 300000
kilometres (186000 mi) in one second, these measurements of small fractions
of a second must be very precise. The Lunar Laser Ranging Experiment, radar
astronomy and the Deep Space Network determine distances to the Moon,⁷⁸
planets⁷⁹ and spacecraft,⁸⁰ respectively, by measuring round-trip transit
times.

High-frequency trading

The speed of light has become important in high-frequency trading, where
traders seek to gain minute advantages by delivering their trades to
exchanges fractions of a second ahead of other traders. For example,
traders have been switching to microwave communications between trading
hubs, because of the advantage which microwaves travelling at near to the
speed of light in air, have over fibre optic signals which travel 30–40%
slower at the speed of light through glass.⁸¹

Measurement

There are different ways to determine the value of c. One way is to measure
the actual speed at which light waves propagate, which can be done in
various astronomical and earth-based setups. However, it is also possible
to determine c from other physical laws where it appears, for example, by
determining the values of the electromagnetic constants ε₀ and μ₀ and using
their relation to c. Historically, the most accurate results have been
obtained by separately determining the frequency and wavelength of a light
beam, with their product equalling c.

In 1983 the metre was defined as "the length of the path travelled by light
in vacuum during a time interval of ¹⁄₂₉₉₇₉₂₄₅₈ of a second",⁸² fixing the
value of the speed of light at 299792458 m/s by definition, as described
below. Consequently, accurate measurements of the speed of light yield an
accurate realization of the metre rather than an accurate value of c.

Astronomical measurements

Outer space is a convenient setting for measuring the speed of light
because of its large scale and nearly perfect vacuum. Typically, one
measures the time needed for light to traverse some reference distance in
the solar system, such as the radius of the Earth's orbit. Historically,
such measurements could be made fairly accurately, compared to how
accurately the length of the reference distance is known in Earth-based
units. It is customary to express the results in astronomical units (AU)
per day.

Ole Christensen Rømer used an astronomical measurement to make the first
quantitative estimate of the speed of light.⁸³ ⁸⁴ When measured from Earth,
the periods of moons orbiting a distant planet are shorter when the Earth
is approaching the planet than when the Earth is receding from it. The
distance travelled by light from the planet (or its moon) to Earth is
shorter when the Earth is at the point in its orbit that is closest to its
planet than when the Earth is at the farthest point in its orbit, the
difference in distance being the diameter of the Earth's orbit around the
Sun. The observed change in the moon's orbital period is caused by the
difference in the time it takes light to traverse the shorter or longer
distance. Rømer observed this effect for Jupiter's innermost moon Io and
deduced that light takes 22 minutes to cross the diameter of the Earth's
orbit.

Another method is to use the aberration of light, discovered and explained
by James Bradley in the 18th century.⁸⁵ This effect results from the vector
addition of the velocity of light arriving from a distant source (such as a
star) and the velocity of its observer (see diagram on the right). A moving
observer thus sees the light coming from a slightly different direction and
consequently sees the source at a position shifted from its original
position. Since the direction of the Earth's velocity changes continuously
as the Earth orbits the Sun, this effect causes the apparent position of
stars to move around. From the angular difference in the position of stars
(maximally 20.5 arcseconds)⁸⁶ it is possible to express the speed of light
in terms of the Earth's velocity around the Sun, which with the known
length of a year can be converted to the time needed to travel from the Sun
to the Earth. In 1729, Bradley used this method to derive that light
travelled 10,210 times faster than the Earth in its orbit (the modern
figure is 10,066 times faster) or, equivalently, that it would take light 8
minutes 12 seconds to travel from the Sun to the Earth.⁸⁵

Astronomical unit

An astronomical unit (AU) is approximately the average distance between the
Earth and Sun. It was redefined in 2012 as exactly 149597870700 m.⁸⁷ ⁸⁸
Previously the AU was not based on the International System of Units but in
terms of the gravitational force exerted by the Sun in the framework of
classical mechanics.[Note 6] The current definition uses the recommended
value in metres for the previous definition of the astronomical unit, which
was determined by measurement.⁸⁷ This redefinition is analogous to that of
the metre, and likewise has the effect of fixing the speed of light to an
exact value in astronomical units per second (via the exact speed of light
in metres per second).

Previously, the inverse of c expressed in seconds per astronomical unit was
measured by comparing the time for radio signals to reach different
spacecraft in the Solar System, with their position calculated from the
gravitational effects of the Sun and various planets. By combining many
such measurements, a best fit value for the light time per unit distance
could be obtained. For example, in 2009, the best estimate, as approved by
the International Astronomical Union (IAU), was:⁹⁰ ⁹¹

  light time for unit distance: 499.004783836(10) sc = 0.00200398880410(4)
  AU/s = 173.144632674(3) AU/day.

The relative uncertainty in these measurements is 0.02 parts per billion
(2×10−11), equivalent to the uncertainty in Earth-based measurements of
length by interferometry.⁹² Since the metre is defined to be the length
travelled by light in a certain time interval, the measurement of the light
time in terms of the previous definition of the astronomical unit can also
be interpreted as measuring the length of an AU (old definition) in
metres.[Note 7]

Time of flight techniques

A method of measuring the speed of light is to measure the time needed for
light to travel to a mirror at a known distance and back. This is the
working principle behind the Fizeau–Foucault apparatus developed by
Hippolyte Fizeau and Léon Foucault.

The setup as used by Fizeau consists of a beam of light directed at a
mirror 8 kilometres (5 mi) away. On the way from the source to the mirror,
the beam passes through a rotating cogwheel. At a certain rate of rotation,
the beam passes through one gap on the way out and another on the way back,
but at slightly higher or lower rates, the beam strikes a tooth and does
not pass through the wheel. Knowing the distance between the wheel and the
mirror, the number of teeth on the wheel, and the rate of rotation, the
speed of light can be calculated.⁹³

The method of Foucault replaces the cogwheel by a rotating mirror. Because
the mirror keeps rotating while the light travels to the distant mirror and
back, the light is reflected from the rotating mirror at a different angle
on its way out than it is on its way back. From this difference in angle,
the known speed of rotation and the distance to the distant mirror the
speed of light may be calculated.⁹⁴

Nowadays, using oscilloscopes with time resolutions of less than one
nanosecond, the speed of light can be directly measured by timing the delay
of a light pulse from a laser or an LED reflected from a mirror. This
method is less precise (with errors of the order of 1%) than other modern
techniques, but it is sometimes used as a laboratory experiment in college
physics classes.⁹⁵ ⁹⁶ ⁹⁷

Electromagnetic constants

An option for deriving c that does not directly depend on a measurement of
the propagation of electromagnetic waves is to use the relation between c
and the vacuum permittivity ε₀ and vacuum permeability μ₀ established by
Maxwell's theory: c² = 1/(ε₀μ₀). The vacuum permittivity may be determined
by measuring the capacitance and dimensions of a capacitor, whereas the
value of the vacuum permeability is fixed at exactly 4π×10−7 H·m−1 through
the definition of the ampere. Rosa and Dorsey used this method in 1907 to
find a value of 299710±22 km/s.⁹⁸ ⁹⁹

Cavity resonance

Another way to measure the speed of light is to independently measure the
frequency f and wavelength λ of an electromagnetic wave in vacuum. The
value of c can then be found by using the relation c = fλ. One option is to
measure the resonance frequency of a cavity resonator. If the dimensions of
the resonance cavity are also known, these can be used to determine the
wavelength of the wave. In 1946, Louis Essen and A.C. Gordon-Smith
established the frequency for a variety of normal modes of microwaves of a
microwave cavity of precisely known dimensions. The dimensions were
established to an accuracy of about ±0.8 μm using gauges calibrated by
interferometry.⁹⁸ As the wavelength of the modes was known from the
geometry of the cavity and from electromagnetic theory, knowledge of the
associated frequencies enabled a calculation of the speed of light.⁹⁸ ¹⁰⁰

The Essen–Gordon-Smith result, 299792±9 km/s, was substantially more
precise than those found by optical techniques.⁹⁸ By 1950, repeated
measurements by Essen established a result of 299792.5±3.0 km/s.¹⁰¹

A household demonstration of this technique is possible, using a microwave
oven and food such as marshmallows or margarine: if the turntable is
removed so that the food does not move, it will cook the fastest at the
antinodes (the points at which the wave amplitude is the greatest), where
it will begin to melt. The distance between two such spots is half the
wavelength of the microwaves; by measuring this distance and multiplying
the wavelength by the microwave frequency (usually displayed on the back of
the oven, typically 2450 MHz), the value of c can be calculated, "often
with less than 5% error".¹⁰² ¹⁰³

Interferometry

Interferometry is another method to find the wavelength of electromagnetic
radiation for determining the speed of light.¹⁰⁴ A coherent beam of light
(e.g. from a laser), with a known frequency (f), is split to follow two
paths and then recombined. By adjusting the path length while observing the
interference pattern and carefully measuring the change in path length, the
wavelength of the light (λ) can be determined. The speed of light is then
calculated using the equation c = λf.

Before the advent of laser technology, coherent radio sources were used for
interferometry measurements of the speed of light.¹⁰⁵ However
interferometric determination of wavelength becomes less precise with
wavelength and the experiments were thus limited in precision by the long
wavelength (~0.4 cm) of the radiowaves. The precision can be improved by
using light with a shorter wavelength, but then it becomes difficult to
directly measure the frequency of the light. One way around this problem is
to start with a low frequency signal of which the frequency can be
precisely measured, and from this signal progressively synthesize higher
frequency signals whose frequency can then be linked to the original
signal. A laser can then be locked to the frequency, and its wavelength can
be determined using interferometry.¹⁰⁶ This technique was due to a group at
the National Bureau of Standards (NBS) (which later became NIST). They used
it in 1972 to measure the speed of light in vacuum with a fractional
uncertainty of 3.5×10−9.¹⁰⁶ ¹⁰⁷

History

Until the early modern period, it was not known whether light travelled
instantaneously or at a very fast finite speed. The first extant recorded
examination of this subject was in ancient Greece. The ancient Greeks,
Muslim scholars and classical European scientists long debated this until
Rømer provided the first calculation of the speed of light. Einstein's
Theory of Special Relativity concluded that the speed of light is constant
regardless of one's frame of reference. Since then, scientists have
provided increasingly accurate measurements.

Early history

Empedocles (c. 490–430 BC) was the first to claim that light has a finite
speed.¹¹⁴ He maintained that light was something in motion, and therefore
must take some time to travel. Aristotle argued, to the contrary, that
"light is due to the presence of something, but it is not a movement".¹¹⁵
Euclid and Ptolemy advanced Empedocles' emission theory of vision, where
light is emitted from the eye, thus enabling sight. Based on that theory,
Heron of Alexandria argued that the speed of light must be infinite because
distant objects such as stars appear immediately upon opening the
eyes.Sayana had made commentary statements of measurement of speed of light
as mentioned in Hindu Vedas. Early Islamic philosophers initially agreed
with the Aristotelian view that light had no speed of travel. In 1021,
Alhazen (Ibn al-Haytham) published the Book of Optics, in which he
presented a series of arguments dismissing the emission theory of vision in
favour of the now accepted intromission theory, in which light moves from
an object into the eye.¹¹⁶ This led Alhazen to propose that light must have
a finite speed,¹¹⁵ ¹¹⁷ ¹¹⁸ and that the speed of light is variable,
decreasing in denser bodies.¹¹⁸ ¹¹⁹ He argued that light is substantial
matter, the propagation of which requires time, even if this is hidden from
our senses.¹²⁰ Also in the 11th century, Abū Rayhān al-Bīrūnī agreed that
light has a finite speed, and observed that the speed of light is much
faster than the speed of sound.¹²¹

In the 13th century, Roger Bacon argued that the speed of light in air was
not infinite, using philosophical arguments backed by the writing of
Alhazen and Aristotle.¹²² ¹²³ In the 1270s, Witelo considered the
possibility of light travelling at infinite speed in vacuum, but slowing
down in denser bodies.¹²⁴

In the early 17th century, Johannes Kepler believed that the speed of light
was infinite, since empty space presents no obstacle to it. René Descartes
argued that if the speed of light were to be finite, the Sun, Earth, and
Moon would be noticeably out of alignment during a lunar eclipse. Since
such misalignment had not been observed, Descartes concluded the speed of
light was infinite. Descartes speculated that if the speed of light were
found to be finite, his whole system of philosophy might be demolished.¹¹⁵
In Descartes' derivation of Snell's law, he assumed that even though the
speed of light was instantaneous, the more dense the medium, the faster was
light's speed.¹²⁵ Pierre de Fermat derived Snell's law using the opposing
assumption, the more dense the medium the slower light traveled. Fermat
also argued in support of a finite speed of light.¹²⁶

First measurement attempts

In 1629, Isaac Beeckman proposed an experiment in which a person observes
the flash of a cannon reflecting off a mirror about one mile (1.6 km) away.
In 1638, Galileo Galilei proposed an experiment, with an apparent claim to
having performed it some years earlier, to measure the speed of light by
observing the delay between uncovering a lantern and its perception some
distance away. He was unable to distinguish whether light travel was
instantaneous or not, but concluded that if it were not, it must
nevertheless be extraordinarily rapid.¹⁰⁹ ¹⁰⁸ In 1667, the Accademia del
Cimento of Florence reported that it had performed Galileo's experiment,
with the lanterns separated by about one mile, but no delay was observed.
The actual delay in this experiment would have been about 11 microseconds.

The first quantitative estimate of the speed of light was made in 1676 by
Rømer (see Rømer's determination of the speed of light).⁸³ ⁸⁴ From the
observation that the periods of Jupiter's innermost moon Io appeared to be
shorter when the Earth was approaching Jupiter than when receding from it,
he concluded that light travels at a finite speed, and estimated that it
takes light 22 minutes to cross the diameter of Earth's orbit. Christiaan
Huygens combined this estimate with an estimate for the diameter of the
Earth's orbit to obtain an estimate of speed of light of 220000 km/s, 26%
lower than the actual value.¹¹²

In his 1704 book Opticks, Isaac Newton reported Rømer's calculations of the
finite speed of light and gave a value of "seven or eight minutes" for the
time taken for light to travel from the Sun to the Earth (the modern value
is 8 minutes 19 seconds).¹²⁷ Newton queried whether Rømer's eclipse shadows
were coloured; hearing that they were not, he concluded the different
colours travelled at the same speed. In 1729, James Bradley discovered
stellar aberration.⁸⁵ From this effect he determined that light must travel
10,210 times faster than the Earth in its orbit (the modern figure is
10,066 times faster) or, equivalently, that it would take light 8 minutes
12 seconds to travel from the Sun to the Earth.⁸⁵

Connections with electromagnetism

See also: History of electromagnetic theory and History of special
relativity

In the 19th century Hippolyte Fizeau developed a method to determine the
speed of light based on time-of-flight measurements on Earth and reported a
value of 315000 km/s. His method was improved upon by Léon Foucault who
obtained a value of 298000 km/s in 1862.⁹³ In the year 1856, Wilhelm Eduard
Weber and Rudolf Kohlrausch measured the ratio of the electromagnetic and
electrostatic units of charge, 1/√ε₀μ₀, by discharging a Leyden jar, and
found that its numerical value was very close to the speed of light as
measured directly by Fizeau. The following year Gustav Kirchhoff calculated
that an electric signal in a resistanceless wire travels along the wire at
this speed.¹²⁸ In the early 1860s, Maxwell showed that, according to the
theory of electromagnetism he was working on, electromagnetic waves
propagate in empty space¹²⁹ ¹³⁰ ¹³¹ at a speed equal to the above
Weber/Kohrausch ratio, and drawing attention to the numerical proximity of
this value to the speed of light as measured by Fizeau, he proposed that
light is in fact an electromagnetic wave.¹³²

"Luminiferous aether"

It was thought at the time that empty space was filled with a background
medium called the luminiferous aether in which the electromagnetic field
existed. Some physicists thought that this aether acted as a preferred
frame of reference for the propagation of light and therefore it should be
possible to measure the motion of the Earth with respect to this medium, by
measuring the isotropy of the speed of light. Beginning in the 1880s
several experiments were performed to try to detect this motion, the most
famous of which is the experiment performed by Albert A. Michelson and
Edward W. Morley in 1887.¹³³ The detected motion was always less than the
observational error. Modern experiments indicate that the two-way speed of
light is isotropic (the same in every direction) to within 6 nanometres per
second.¹³⁴ Because of this experiment Hendrik Lorentz proposed that the
motion of the apparatus through the aether may cause the apparatus to
contract along its length in the direction of motion, and he further
assumed, that the time variable for moving systems must also be changed
accordingly ("local time"), which led to the formulation of the Lorentz
transformation. Based on Lorentz's aether theory, Henri Poincaré (1900)
showed that this local time (to first order in v/c) is indicated by clocks
moving in the aether, which are synchronized under the assumption of
constant light speed. In 1904, he speculated that the speed of light could
be a limiting velocity in dynamics, provided that the assumptions of
Lorentz's theory are all confirmed. In 1905, Poincaré brought Lorentz's
aether theory into full observational agreement with the principle of
relativity.¹³⁵ ¹³⁶

Special relativity

In 1905 Einstein postulated from the outset that the speed of light in
vacuum, measured by a non-accelerating observer, is independent of the
motion of the source or observer. Using this and the principle of
relativity as a basis he derived the special theory of relativity, in which
the speed of light in vacuum c featured as a fundamental constant, also
appearing in contexts unrelated to light. This made the concept of the
stationary aether (to which Lorentz and Poincaré still adhered) useless and
revolutionized the concepts of space and time.¹³⁷ ¹³⁸

Increased accuracy of c and redefinition of the metre and second

See also: History of the metre

In the second half of the 20th century much progress was made in increasing
the accuracy of measurements of the speed of light, first by cavity
resonance techniques and later by laser interferometer techniques. These
were aided by new, more precise, definitions of the metre and second. In
1950, Louis Essen determined the speed as 299792.5±1 km/s, using cavity
resonance. This value was adopted by the 12th General Assembly of the
Radio-Scientific Union in 1957. In 1960, the metre was redefined in terms
of the wavelength of a particular spectral line of krypton-86, and, in
1967, the second was redefined in terms of the hyperfine transition
frequency of the ground state of caesium-133.

In 1972, using the laser interferometer method and the new definitions, a
group at NBS in Boulder, Colorado determined the speed of light in vacuum
to be c = 299792456.2±1.1 m/s. This was 100 times less uncertain than the
previously accepted value. The remaining uncertainty was mainly related to
the definition of the metre.[Note 10]¹⁰⁷ As similar experiments found
comparable results for c, the 15th Conférence Générale des Poids et Mesures
(CGPM) in 1975 recommended using the value 299792458 m/s for the speed of
light.¹⁴¹

Defining the speed of light as an explicit constant

In 1983 the 17th CGPM found that wavelengths from frequency measurements
and a given value for the speed of light are more reproducible than the
previous standard. They kept the 1967 definition of second, so the caesium
hyperfine frequency would now determine both the second and the metre. To
do this, they redefined the metre as: "The metre is the length of the path
travelled by light in vacuum during a time interval of 1/299792458 of a
second."⁸² As a result of this definition, the value of the speed of light
in vacuum is exactly 299792458 m/s¹⁴² ¹⁴³ and has become a defined constant
in the SI system of units.¹¹ Improved experimental techniques that prior to
1983 would have measured the speed of light, no longer affect the known
value of the speed of light in SI units, but instead allow a more precise
realization of the metre by more accurately measuring the wavelength of
Krypton-86 and other light sources.¹⁴⁴ ¹⁴⁵

In 2011, the CGPM stated its intention to redefine all seven SI base units
using what it calls "the explicit-constant formulation", where each "unit
is defined indirectly by specifying explicitly an exact value for a
well-recognized fundamental constant", as was done for the speed of light.
It proposed a new, but completely equivalent, wording of the metre's
definition: "The metre, symbol m, is the unit of length; its magnitude is
set by fixing the numerical value of the speed of light in vacuum to be
equal to exactly 299792458 when it is expressed in the SI unit m s−1."¹⁴⁶
This is one of the proposed changes to be incorporated in the next revision
of the SI also termed the New SI.

[1] Exact value:

[2] The speed of light in imperial units and US units is based on an inch
  of exactly 2.54 cm and is exactly 186,282 miles, 698 yards, 2 feet, and 5
  21/127 inches per second.¹²
[3] However, the frequency of light can depend on the motion of the source
  relative to the observer, due to the Doppler effect.
[4] Whereas moving objects are measured to be shorter along the line of
  relative motion, they are also seen as being rotated. This effect, known
  as Terrell rotation, is due to the different times that light from
  different parts of the object takes to reach the observer.²⁰ ²¹
[5] It is thought that the Scharnhorst effect does allow signals to travel
  slightly faster than c, but the special conditions in which this effect
  can occur prevent one from using this effect to violate causality.³⁵
[6] The astronomical unit was defined as the radius of an unperturbed
  circular Newtonian orbit about the Sun of a particle having infinitesimal
  mass, moving with an angular frequency of 0.01720209895 radians
  (approximately ¹⁄365.256898 of a revolution) per day.⁸⁹
[7] Nevertheless, at this degree of precision, the effects of general
  relativity must be taken into consideration when interpreting the length.
  The metre is considered to be a unit of proper length, whereas the AU is
  usually used as a unit of observed length in a given frame of reference.

  According to Galileo, the lanterns he used were "at a short distance,
  less than a mile." Assuming the distance was not too much shorter than a
  mile, and that "about a thirtieth of a second is the minimum time
  interval distinguishable by the unaided eye", Boyer notes that Galileo's
  experiment could at best be said to have established a lower limit of
  about 60 miles per second for the velocity of light.

  krypton 86 atom."¹³⁹ It was discovered in the 1970s that this spectral

  c could be used as a variable for velocity. This usage can be traced back
  to the classic Latin texts in which c stood for 'celeritas' meaning
  'speed'."

Star

For other uses, see Star (disambiguation).

A star is a luminous sphere of plasma held together by its own gravity. The
nearest star to Earth is the Sun. Other stars are visible from Earth during
the night, appearing as a multitude of fixed luminous points in the sky due
to their immense distance from Earth. Historically, the most prominent
stars were grouped into constellations and asterisms, and the brightest
stars gained proper names. Extensive catalogues of stars have been
assembled by astronomers, which provide standardized star designations.

For at least a portion of its life, a star shines due to thermonuclear
fusion of hydrogen into helium in its core, releasing energy that traverses
the star's interior and then radiates into outer space. Once the hydrogen
in the core of a star is nearly exhausted, almost all naturally occurring
elements heavier than helium are created by stellar nucleosynthesis during
the star's lifetime and, for some stars, by supernova nucleosynthesis when
it explodes. Near the end of its life, a star can also contain degenerate
matter. Astronomers can determine the mass, age, metallicity (chemical
composition), and many other properties of a star by observing its motion
through space, luminosity, and spectrum respectively. The total mass of a
star is the principal determinant of its evolution and eventual fate. Other
characteristics of a star, including diameter and temperature, change over
its life, while the star's environment affects its rotation and movement. A
plot of the temperature of many stars against their luminosities, known as
a Hertzsprung–Russell diagram (H–R diagram), allows the age and
evolutionary state of a star to be determined.

A star's life begins with the gravitational collapse of a gaseous nebula of
material composed primarily of hydrogen, along with helium and trace
amounts of heavier elements. Once the stellar core is sufficiently dense,
hydrogen becomes steadily converted into helium through nuclear fusion,
releasing energy in the process.¹ The remainder of the star's interior
carries energy away from the core through a combination of radiative and
convective processes. The star's internal pressure prevents it from
collapsing further under its own gravity. Once the hydrogen fuel at the
core is exhausted, a star with at least 0.4 times the mass of the Sun²
expands to become a red giant, in some cases fusing heavier elements at the
core or in shells around the core. The star then evolves into a degenerate
form, recycling a portion of its matter into the interstellar environment,
where it will contribute to the formation of a new generation of stars with
a higher proportion of heavy elements.³ Meanwhile, the core becomes a
stellar remnant: a white dwarf, a neutron star, or (if it is sufficiently
massive) a black hole.

Binary and multi-star systems consist of two or more stars that are
gravitationally bound, and generally move around each other in stable
orbits. When two such stars have a relatively close orbit, their
gravitational interaction can have a significant impact on their
evolution.⁴ Stars can form part of a much larger gravitationally bound
structure, such as a star cluster or a galaxy.

Observation history

Historically, stars have been important to civilizations throughout the
world. They have been part of religious practices and used for celestial
navigation and orientation. Many ancient astronomers believed that stars
were permanently affixed to a heavenly sphere, and that they were
immutable. By convention, astronomers grouped stars into constellations and
used them to track the motions of the planets and the inferred position of
the Sun.⁵ The motion of the Sun against the background stars (and the
horizon) was used to create calendars, which could be used to regulate
agricultural practices.⁷ The Gregorian calendar, currently used nearly
everywhere in the world, is a solar calendar based on the angle of the
Earth's rotational axis relative to its local star, the Sun.

The oldest accurately dated star chart appeared in ancient Egyptian
astronomy in 1534 BC.⁸ The earliest known star catalogues were compiled by
the ancient Babylonian astronomers of Mesopotamia in the late 2nd
millennium BC, during the Kassite Period (ca. 1531–1155 BC).⁹

The first star catalogue in Greek astronomy was created by Aristillus in
approximately 300 BC, with the help of Timocharis.¹⁰ The star catalog of
Hipparchus (2nd century BC) included 1020 stars, and was used to assemble
Ptolemy's star catalogue.¹¹ Hipparchus is known for the discovery of the
first recorded nova (new star).¹² Many of the constellations and star names
in use today derive from Greek astronomy.

In spite of the apparent immutability of the heavens, Chinese astronomers
were aware that new stars could appear.¹³ In 185 AD, they were the first to
observe and write about a supernova, now known as the SN 185.¹⁴ The
brightest stellar event in recorded history was the SN 1006 supernova,
which was observed in 1006 and written about by the Egyptian astronomer Ali
ibn Ridwan and several Chinese astronomers.¹⁵ The SN 1054 supernova, which
gave birth to the Crab Nebula, was also observed by Chinese and Islamic
astronomers.¹⁶ ¹⁷ ¹⁸

Medieval Islamic astronomers gave Arabic names to many stars that are still
used today, and they invented numerous astronomical instruments that could
compute the positions of the stars. They built the first large observatory
research institutes, mainly for the purpose of producing Zij star
catalogues.¹⁹ Among these, the Book of Fixed Stars (964) was written by the
Persian astronomer Abd al-Rahman al-Sufi, who observed a number of stars,
star clusters (including the Omicron Velorum and Brocchi's Clusters) and
galaxies (including the Andromeda Galaxy).²⁰ According to A. Zahoor, in the
11th century, the Persian polymath scholar Abu Rayhan Biruni described the
Milky Way galaxy as a multitude of fragments having the properties of
nebulous stars, and also gave the latitudes of various stars during a lunar
eclipse in 1019.²¹

According to Josep Puig, the Andalusian astronomer Ibn Bajjah proposed that
the Milky Way was made up of many stars which almost touched one another
and appeared to be a continuous image due to the effect of refraction from
sublunary material, citing his observation of the conjunction of Jupiter
and Mars on 500 AH (1106/1107 AD) as evidence.²² Early European astronomers
such as Tycho Brahe identified new stars in the night sky (later termed
novae), suggesting that the heavens were not immutable. In 1584 Giordano
Bruno suggested that the stars were like the Sun, and may have other
planets, possibly even Earth-like, in orbit around them,²³ an idea that had
been suggested earlier by the ancient Greek philosophers, Democritus and
Epicurus,²⁴ and by medieval Islamic cosmologists²⁵ such as Fakhr al-Din
al-Razi.²⁶ By the following century, the idea of the stars being the same
as the Sun was reaching a consensus among astronomers. To explain why these
stars exerted no net gravitational pull on the Solar System, Isaac Newton
suggested that the stars were equally distributed in every direction, an
idea prompted by the theologian Richard Bentley.²⁷

The Italian astronomer Geminiano Montanari recorded observing variations in
luminosity of the star Algol in 1667. Edmond Halley published the first
measurements of the proper motion of a pair of nearby "fixed" stars,
demonstrating that they had changed positions from the time of the ancient
Greek astronomers Ptolemy and Hipparchus.²³

William Herschel was the first astronomer to attempt to determine the
distribution of stars in the sky. During the 1780s, he performed a series
of gauges in 600 directions, and counted the stars observed along each line
of sight. From this he deduced that the number of stars steadily increased
toward one side of the sky, in the direction of the Milky Way core. His son
John Herschel repeated this study in the southern hemisphere and found a
corresponding increase in the same direction.²⁸ In addition to his other
accomplishments, William Herschel is also noted for his discovery that some
stars do not merely lie along the same line of sight, but are also physical
companions that form binary star systems.

The science of stellar spectroscopy was pioneered by Joseph von Fraunhofer
and Angelo Secchi. By comparing the spectra of stars such as Sirius to the
Sun, they found differences in the strength and number of their absorption
lines—the dark lines in a stellar spectra due to the absorption of specific
frequencies by the atmosphere. In 1865 Secchi began classifying stars into
spectral types.²⁹ However, the modern version of the stellar classification
scheme was developed by Annie J. Cannon during the 1900s.

The first direct measurement of the distance to a star (61 Cygni at 11.4
light-years) was made in 1838 by Friedrich Bessel using the parallax
technique. Parallax measurements demonstrated the vast separation of the
stars in the heavens.²³ Observation of double stars gained increasing
importance during the 19th century. In 1834, Friedrich Bessel observed
changes in the proper motion of the star Sirius, and inferred a hidden
companion. Edward Pickering discovered the first spectroscopic binary in
1899 when he observed the periodic splitting of the spectral lines of the
star Mizar in a 104-day period. Detailed observations of many binary star
systems were collected by astronomers such as William Struve and S. W.
Burnham, allowing the masses of stars to be determined from computation of
the orbital elements. The first solution to the problem of deriving an
orbit of binary stars from telescope observations was made by Felix Savary
in 1827.³⁰ The twentieth century saw increasingly rapid advances in the
scientific study of stars. The photograph became a valuable astronomical
tool. Karl Schwarzschild discovered that the color of a star and, hence,
its temperature, could be determined by comparing the visual magnitude
against the photographic magnitude. The development of the photoelectric
photometer allowed very precise measurements of magnitude at multiple
wavelength intervals. In 1921 Albert A. Michelson made the first
measurements of a stellar diameter using an interferometer on the Hooker
telescope at Mount Wilson Observatory.³¹

Important theoretical work on the physical structure of stars occurred
during the first decades of the twentieth century. In 1913, the
Hertzsprung-Russell diagram was developed, propelling the astrophysical
study of stars. Successful models were developed to explain the interiors
of stars and stellar evolution. Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin first proposed
that stars were made primarily of hydrogen and helium in her 1925 PhD
thesis.³² The spectra of stars were further understood through advances in
quantum physics. This allowed the chemical composition of the stellar
atmosphere to be determined.³³

With the exception of supernovae, individual stars have primarily been
observed in our Local Group of galaxies,³⁴ and especially in the visible
part of the Milky Way (as demonstrated by the detailed star catalogues
available for our galaxy).³⁵ But some stars have been observed in the M100
galaxy of the Virgo Cluster, about 100 million light years from the
Earth.³⁶ In the Local Supercluster it is possible to see star clusters, and
current telescopes could in principle observe faint individual stars in the
Local Cluster³⁷ (see Cepheids). However, outside the Local Supercluster of
galaxies, neither individual stars nor clusters of stars have been
observed. The only exception is a faint image of a large star cluster
containing hundreds of thousands of stars located at a distance of one
billion light years³⁸ —ten times further than the most distant star cluster
previously observed.

Designations

Main articles: Stellar designation, Astronomical naming conventions and
Star catalogue

The concept of the constellation was known to exist during the Babylonian
period. Ancient sky watchers imagined that prominent arrangements of stars
formed patterns, and they associated these with particular aspects of
nature or their myths. Twelve of these formations lay along the band of the
ecliptic and these became the basis of astrology.³⁹ Many of the more
prominent individual stars were also given names, particularly with Arabic
or Latin designations.

As well as certain constellations and the Sun itself, individual stars have
their own myths.⁴⁰ To the Ancient Greeks, some "stars", known as planets
(Greek πλανήτης (planētēs), meaning "wanderer"), represented various
important deities, from which the names of the planets Mercury, Venus,
Mars, Jupiter and Saturn were taken.⁴⁰ (Uranus and Neptune were also Greek
and Roman gods, but neither planet was known in Antiquity because of their
low brightness. Their names were assigned by later astronomers.)

Circa 1600, the names of the constellations were used to name the stars in
the corresponding regions of the sky. The German astronomer Johann Bayer
created a series of star maps and applied Greek letters as designations to
the stars in each constellation. Later a numbering system based on the
star's right ascension was invented and added to John Flamsteed's star
catalogue in his book "Historia coelestis Britannica" (the 1712 edition),
whereby this numbering system came to be called Flamsteed designation or
Flamsteed numbering.⁴¹ ⁴²

The only internationally recognized authority for naming celestial bodies
is the International Astronomical Union (IAU).⁴³ A number of private
companies sell names of stars, which the British Library calls an
unregulated commercial enterprise.⁴⁴ ⁴⁵ However, the IAU has disassociated
itself from this commercial practice, and these names are neither
recognized by the IAU nor used by them.⁴⁶ One such star naming company is
the International Star Registry, which, during the 1980s, was accused of
deceptive practice for making it appear that the assigned name was
official. This now-discontinued ISR practice was informally labeled a scam
and a fraud,⁴⁷ ⁴⁸ ⁴⁹ ⁵⁰ and the New York City Department of Consumer
Affairs issued a violation against ISR for engaging in a deceptive trade
practice.⁵¹ ⁵²

Units of measurement

Although stellar parameters can be expressed in SI units or CGS units, it
is often most convenient to express mass, luminosity, and radii in solar
units, based on the characteristics of the Sun:

Large lengths, such as the radius of a giant star or the semi-major axis of
a binary star system, are often expressed in terms of the astronomical unit
—approximately equal to the mean distance between the Earth and the Sun
(150 million km or 93 million miles).

Formation and evolution

Main article: Stellar evolution

Stars form within extended regions of higher density in the interstellar
medium, although the density is still lower than the inside of a vacuum
chamber. These regions - known as molecular clouds - consist mostly of
hydrogen, with about 23 to 28 percent helium and a few percent heavier
elements. One example of such a star-forming region is the Orion Nebula.⁵⁵
As massive stars form from molecular clouds, they powerfully illuminate
those clouds. They also ionize the hydrogen, creating an H II region.

All stars spend the majority of their existence as main sequence stars,
fueled primarily by the nuclear fusion of hydrogen into helium within their
cores. However, stars of different masses have markedly different
properties at various stages of their development. The ultimate fate of
more massive stars differs from that of less massive stars, as do their
luminosity and the impact they have on their environment. Accordingly,
astronomers often group stars by their mass:⁵⁶

- Very low mass stars with masses below 0.5 M☉ are fully convective and
  distribute helium evenly throughout the whole star while on the main
  sequence. Therefore, they never undergo shell burning, never become red
  giants, and are theorized to become helium white dwarfs which simply cool
  off after exhausting their hydrogen.⁵⁷ However, as the lifetime of 0.5 M☉
  stars is longer than the age of the universe, no such star has yet
  reached the white dwarf stage.
- Low mass stars (including the Sun), with a main sequence mass above about
  0.5 M☉ and below 1.8–2.5 M☉ depending on composition, do become red
  giants when their core hydrogen is depleted, then ignite a degenerate
  helium core in a helium flash, develop a degenerate carbon-oxygen core on
  the asymptotic giant branch, and finally produce a planetary nebula to
  become a white dwarf.
- Intermediate-mass stars, between 1.8–2.5 M☉ and 5–10 M☉, pass through
  similar evolutionary stages to the low mass stars, but after a relatively
  short period on the RGB they ignite helium without a flash and spend an
  extended period in the red clump before forming a degenerate
  carbon-oxygen core.
- Massive stars generally have a minimum mass of 7–10 M☉, but this may be
  as low as 5–6 M☉. After exhausting the hydrogen at the core these stars
  become supergiants and go on to fuse elements heavier than helium. They
  end their lives when their cores collapse and they explode as supernovae.

Star formation

Main article: Star formation

The formation of a star begins with gravitational instability within a
molecular cloud, caused by regions of higher density - often triggered by
shock-waves from nearby supernovae (massive stellar explosions), the
collision of different molecular clouds, or the collision of galaxies (as
in a starburst galaxy). Once a region reaches a sufficient density of
matter to satisfy the criteria for Jeans instability, it begins to collapse
under its own gravitational force.⁵⁸

As the cloud collapses, individual conglomerations of dense dust and gas
form "Bok globules". As a globule collapses and the density increases, the
gravitational energy converts into heat and the temperature rises. When the
protostellar cloud has approximately reached the stable condition of
hydrostatic equilibrium, a protostar forms at the core.⁵⁹ These pre–main
sequence stars are often surrounded by a protoplanetary disk and powered
mainly by the conversion of gravitational energy. The period of
gravitational contraction lasts about 10 to 15 million years.

Early stars of less than 2 M☉ are called T Tauri stars, while those with
greater mass are Herbig Ae/Be stars. These newly formed stars emit jets of
gas along their axis of rotation, which may reduce the angular momentum of
the collapsing star and result in small patches of nebulosity known as
Herbig–Haro objects.⁶⁰ ⁶¹ These jets, in combination with radiation from
nearby massive stars, may help to drive away the surrounding cloud from
which the star was formed.⁶²

Early in their development, T Tauri stars follow the Hayashi track—they
contract and decrease in luminosity while remaining at roughly the same
temperature. Less massive T Tauri stars follow this track to the main
sequence, while more massive stars turn onto the Henyey track.

Main sequence

Main article: Main sequence

Stars spend about 90% of their existence fusing hydrogen into helium in
high-temperature and high-pressure reactions near the core. Such stars are
said to be on the main sequence, and are called dwarf stars. Starting at
zero-age main sequence, the proportion of helium in a star's core will
steadily increase, the rate of nuclear fusion at the core will slowly
increase, as will the star's temperature and luminosity.⁶³ The Sun, for
example, is estimated to have increased in luminosity by about 40% since it
reached the main sequence 4.6 billion (4.6 × 10⁹) years ago.⁶⁴

Every star generates a stellar wind of particles that causes a continual
outflow of gas into space. For most stars, the mass lost is negligible. The
Sun loses 10−14 M☉ every year,⁶⁵ or about 0.01% of its total mass over its
entire lifespan. However, very massive stars can lose 10−7 to 10−5 M☉ each
year, significantly affecting their evolution.⁶⁶ Stars that begin with more
than 50 M☉ can lose over half their total mass while on the main
sequence.⁶⁷

The duration that a star spends on the main sequence depends primarily on
the amount of fuel it has to fuse and the rate at which it fuses that fuel,
i.e. its initial mass and its luminosity. For the Sun, its life is
estimated to be about 10 billion (10¹⁰) years. Massive stars consume their
fuel very rapidly and are short-lived. Low mass stars consume their fuel
very slowly. Stars less massive than 0.25 M☉, called red dwarfs, are able
to fuse nearly all of their mass as fuel while stars of about 1 M☉ can only
use about 10% of their mass as fuel. The combination of their slow
fuel-consumption and relatively large usable fuel supply allows about 0.25
M☉ stars to last for about one trillion (10¹²) years according to
stellar-evolution calculations, while the least-massive hydrogen-fusing
stars (0.08 M☉) will last for about 12 trillion years. Red dwarfs become
hotter and more luminous as they accumulate helium. When they eventually
run out of hydrogen, they contract into a white dwarf and start to cool.⁵⁷
However, since the lifespan of such stars is greater than the current age
of the universe (13.8 billion years), no stars under about 0.85 M☉⁶⁸ are
expected to have moved off the main sequence.

Besides mass, the elements heavier than helium can play a significant role
in the evolution of stars. Astronomers consider all elements heavier than
helium "metals", and call the chemical concentration of these elements the
metallicity. The metallicity can influence the duration that a star will
burn its fuel, control the formation of magnetic fields,⁶⁹ and modify the
strength of the stellar wind.⁷⁰ Older, population II stars have
substantially less metallicity than the younger, population I stars due to
the composition of the molecular clouds from which they formed. Over time
these clouds become increasingly enriched in heavier elements as older
stars die and shed portions of their atmospheres.

Post–main sequence

Main article: Red giant

As stars of at least 0.4 M☉² exhaust their supply of hydrogen at their
core, they start to fuse hydrogen in a shell outside the helium core. Their
outer layers expand and cool greatly to form a red giant. In about 5
billion years, when the Sun enters this phase, it will expand to a maximum
radius of roughly 1 astronomical unit (150 million kilometres), 250 times
its present size. As a giant, the Sun will lose roughly 30% of its current
mass.⁶⁴ ⁷¹

As hydrogen shell burning produces more helium, the core increases in mass
and temperature. In a red giant of up to 2.25 M☉, the helium core becomes
degenerate before it is compressed enough to start helium fusion. When the
temperature increases sufficiently helium fusion begins explosively in the
helium flash, and the star rapidly shrinks in radius, increases its surface
temperature, and moves to the horizontal branch. For more massive stars,
the helium core fusion starts before the core becomes degenerate, and the
star spends some time in the red clump before the outer convective envelope
collapses and the star moves to the horizontal branch.⁴

After the star has consumed the helium at the core, fusion continues in a
shell around a hot core of carbon and oxygen. The star then follows an
evolutionary path (the asymptotic giant branch or AGB) that parallels the
original red giant phase at a higher luminosity. The more massive AGB stars
may undergo a brief period of carbon fusion before the core becomes
degenerate.

Massive stars

Main article: Red supergiant

During their helium-burning phase, very high-mass stars with more than nine
solar masses expand to form red supergiants. Once this fuel is exhausted at
the core, they continue to fuse elements heavier than helium.

The core contracts until the temperature and pressure suffice to fuse
carbon (see Carbon burning process). This process continues, with the
successive stages being fueled by neon (see neon burning process), oxygen
(see oxygen burning process), and silicon (see silicon burning process).
Near the end of the star's life, fusion continues along a series of
onion-layer shells within the star. Each shell fuses a different element,
with the outermost shell fusing hydrogen; the next shell fusing helium, and
so forth.⁷²

The final stage occurs when a massive star begins producing iron. Since
iron nuclei are more tightly bound than any heavier nuclei, any fusion
beyond iron does not produce a net release of energy—the process would, on
the contrary, consume energy. Likewise, since they are more tightly bound
than all lighter nuclei, energy cannot be released by fission.⁷³ In
relatively old, very massive stars, a large core of inert iron will
accumulate in the center of the star. The heavier elements in these stars
can work their way to the surface, forming evolved objects known as
Wolf-Rayet stars that have a dense stellar wind which sheds the outer
atmosphere.

Collapse

As a star's core shrinks, the intensity of radiation from that surface
increases, creating such radiation pressure on the outer shell of gas that
it will push those layers away, forming a planetary nebula. If what remains
after the outer atmosphere has been shed is less than 1.4 M☉, it shrinks to
a relatively tiny object about the size of Earth, known as a white dwarf.
White dwarfs lack the mass for further gravitational compression to take
place.⁷⁴ The electron-degenerate matter inside a white dwarf is no longer a
plasma, even though stars are generally referred to as being spheres of
plasma. Eventually, white dwarfs fade into black dwarfs over a very long
period of time.

In larger stars, fusion continues until the iron core has grown so large
(more than 1.4 M☉) that it can no longer support its own mass. This core
will suddenly collapse as its electrons are driven into its protons,
forming neutrons, neutrinos, and gamma rays in a burst of electron capture
and inverse beta decay. The shockwave formed by this sudden collapse causes
the rest of the star to explode in a supernova. Supernovae become so bright
that they may briefly outshine the star's entire home galaxy. When they
occur within the Milky Way, supernovae have historically been observed by
naked-eye observers as "new stars" where none seemingly existed before.⁷⁵

Supernova explosions blow away the star's outer layers, leaving remnants
such as the Crab Nebula.⁷⁵ There remains a neutron star (which sometimes
manifests itself as a pulsar or X-ray burster) or, in the case of the
largest stars (large enough to leave a remnant greater than roughly 4 M☉),
a black hole.⁷⁶ In a neutron star the matter is in a state known as
neutron-degenerate matter, with a more exotic form of degenerate matter,
QCD matter, possibly present in the core. Within a black hole the matter is
in a state that is not currently understood.

The blown-off outer layers of dying stars include heavy elements, which may
be recycled during the formation of new stars. These heavy elements allow
the formation of rocky planets. The outflow from supernovae and the stellar
wind of large stars play an important part in shaping the interstellar
medium.⁷⁵

Distribution

In addition to isolated stars, a multi-star system can consist of two or
more gravitationally bound stars that orbit each other. The simplest and
most common multi-star system is a binary star, but systems of three or
more stars are also found. For reasons of orbital stability, such
multi-star systems are often organized into hierarchical sets of binary
stars.⁷⁷ Larger groups called star clusters also exist. These range from
loose stellar associations with only a few stars, up to enormous globular
clusters with hundreds of thousands of stars.

It has been a long-held assumption that the majority of stars occur in
gravitationally bound, multiple-star systems. This is particularly true for
very massive O and B class stars, where 80% of the stars are believed to be
part of multiple-star systems. However the proportion of single star
systems increases for smaller stars, so that only 25% of red dwarfs are
known to have stellar companions. As 85% of all stars are red dwarfs, most
stars in the Milky Way are likely single from birth.⁷⁸

Stars are not spread uniformly across the universe, but are normally
grouped into galaxies along with interstellar gas and dust. A typical
galaxy contains hundreds of billions of stars, and there are more than 100
billion (10¹¹) galaxies in the observable universe.⁷⁹ In 2010, one estimate
of the number of stars in the observable universe was 300 sextillion (3 ×
10²³) in the observable universe.⁸⁰ While it is often believed that stars
only exist within galaxies, intergalactic stars have been discovered.⁸¹

The nearest star to the Earth, apart from the Sun, is Proxima Centauri,
which is 39.9 trillion kilometres, or 4.2 light-years away. Travelling at
the orbital speed of the Space Shuttle (8 kilometres per second—almost
30,000 kilometres per hour), it would take about 150,000 years to get
there.⁸² Distances like this are typical inside galactic discs, including
in the vicinity of the solar system.⁸³ Stars can be much closer to each
other in the centres of galaxies and in globular clusters, or much farther
apart in galactic halos.

Due to the relatively vast distances between stars outside the galactic
nucleus, collisions between stars are thought to be rare. In denser regions
such as the core of globular clusters or the galactic center, collisions
can be more common.⁸⁴ Such collisions can produce what are known as blue
stragglers. These abnormal stars have a higher surface temperature than the
other main sequence stars with the same luminosity in the cluster.⁸⁵

Characteristics

Almost everything about a star is determined by its initial mass, including
essential characteristics such as luminosity and size, as well as its
evolution, lifespan, and eventual fate.

Age

Most stars are between 1 billion and 10 billion years old. Some stars may
even be close to 13.8 billion years old—the observed age of the universe.
The oldest star yet discovered, HD 140283, nicknamed Methuselah star, is an
estimated 14.46 ± 0.8 billion years old.⁸⁶ (Due to the uncertainty in the
value, this age for the star does not conflict with the age of the
Universe, determined by the Planck satellite as 13.799 ± 0.021).⁸⁶ ⁸⁷

The more massive the star, the shorter its lifespan, primarily because
massive stars have greater pressure on their cores, causing them to burn
hydrogen more rapidly. The most massive stars last an average of a few
million years, while stars of minimum mass (red dwarfs) burn their fuel
very slowly and can last tens to hundreds of billions of years.⁸⁸ ⁸⁹

Chemical composition

See also: Metallicity and Molecules in stars
  "From a chemist's point of view, the surface or interior of a star…is
  boring—there are no molecules there."--Roald Hoffmann⁹⁰

When stars form in the present Milky Way galaxy they are composed of about
71% hydrogen and 27% helium,⁹¹ as measured by mass, with a small fraction
of heavier elements. Typically the portion of heavy elements is measured in
terms of the iron content of the stellar atmosphere, as iron is a common
element and its absorption lines are relatively easy to measure. The
portion of heavier elements may be an indicator of the likelihood that the
star has a planetary system.⁹²

The star with the lowest iron content ever measured is the dwarf
HE1327-2326, with only 1/200,000th the iron content of the Sun.⁹³ By
contrast, the super-metal-rich star μ Leonis has nearly double the
abundance of iron as the Sun, while the planet-bearing star 14 Herculis has
nearly triple the iron.⁹⁴ There also exist chemically peculiar stars that
show unusual abundances of certain elements in their spectrum; especially
chromium and rare earth elements.⁹⁵

Diameter

Due to their great distance from the Earth, all stars except the Sun appear
to the unaided eye as shining points in the night sky that twinkle because
of the effect of the Earth's atmosphere. The Sun is also a star, but it is
close enough to the Earth to appear as a disk instead, and to provide
daylight. Other than the Sun, the star with the largest apparent size is R
Doradus, with an angular diameter of only 0.057 arcseconds.⁹⁶

The disks of most stars are much too small in angular size to be observed
with current ground-based optical telescopes, and so interferometer
telescopes are required to produce images of these objects. Another
technique for measuring the angular size of stars is through occultation.
By precisely measuring the drop in brightness of a star as it is occulted
by the Moon (or the rise in brightness when it reappears), the star's
angular diameter can be computed.⁹⁷

Stars range in size from neutron stars, which vary anywhere from 20 to 40
km (25 mi) in diameter, to supergiants like Betelgeuse in the Orion
constellation, which has a diameter approximately 1,070 times that of the
Sun—about 1,490,171,880 km (925,949,878 mi). Betelgeuse, however, has a
much lower density than the Sun.⁹⁸

Kinematics

Main article: Stellar kinematics

The motion of a star relative to the Sun can provide useful information
about the origin and age of a star, as well as the structure and evolution
of the surrounding galaxy. The components of motion of a star consist of
the radial velocity toward or away from the Sun, and the traverse angular
movement, which is called its proper motion.

Radial velocity is measured by the doppler shift of the star's spectral
lines, and is given in units of km/s. The proper motion of a star is
determined by precise astrometric measurements in units of milli-arc
seconds (mas) per year. By determining the parallax of a star, the proper
motion can then be converted into units of velocity. Stars with high rates
of proper motion are likely to be relatively close to the Sun, making them
good candidates for parallax measurements.¹⁰⁰

Once both rates of movement are known, the space velocity of the star
relative to the Sun or the galaxy can be computed. Among nearby stars, it
has been found that younger population I stars have generally lower
velocities than older, population II stars. The latter have elliptical
orbits that are inclined to the plane of the galaxy.¹⁰¹ A comparison of the
kinematics of nearby stars has also led to the identification of stellar
associations. These are most likely groups of stars that share a common
point of origin in giant molecular clouds.¹⁰²

Magnetic field

Main article: Stellar magnetic field

The magnetic field of a star is generated within regions of the interior
where convective circulation occurs. This movement of conductive plasma
functions like a dynamo, generating magnetic fields that extend throughout
the star. The strength of the magnetic field varies with the mass and
composition of the star, and the amount of magnetic surface activity
depends upon the star's rate of rotation. This surface activity produces
starspots, which are regions of strong magnetic fields and lower than
normal surface temperatures. Coronal loops are arching magnetic fields that
reach out into the corona from active regions. Stellar flares are bursts of
high-energy particles that are emitted due to the same magnetic
activity.¹⁰³

Young, rapidly rotating stars tend to have high levels of surface activity
because of their magnetic field. The magnetic field can act upon a star's
stellar wind, functioning as a brake to gradually slow the rate of rotation
with time. Thus, older stars such as the Sun have a much slower rate of
rotation and a lower level of surface activity. The activity levels of
slowly rotating stars tend to vary in a cyclical manner and can shut down
altogether for periods of time.¹⁰⁴ During the Maunder minimum, for example,
the Sun underwent a 70-year period with almost no sunspot activity.

Mass

Main article: Stellar mass

One of the most massive stars known is Eta Carinae,¹⁰⁵ which, with 100–150
times as much mass as the Sun, will have a lifespan of only several million
years. Sudies of the most massive open clusters suggests 150 M☉ as an upper
limit for stars in the current era of the universe.¹⁰⁶ This represents an
empirical value for the theoretical limit on the formation of massive stars
due to increasing radiation pressure on the accreting gas cloud. Several
stars in the R136 cluster in the Large Magellanic Cloud have been measured
with larger masses,¹⁰⁷ but it has been determined that they could have been
created through the collision and merger of massive stars in close binary
systems, sidestepping the 150 M☉ limit on massive star formation.¹⁰⁸

The first stars to form after the Big Bang may have been larger, up to 300
M☉ or more,¹⁰⁹ due to the complete absence of elements heavier than lithium
in their composition. This generation of supermassive population III stars
is likely to have existed in the very early universe (i.e., at high
redshift), and may have started the production of chemical elements heavier
than hydrogen that are needed for the later formation of planets and life.
In June 2015, astronomers reported evidence for Population III stars in the
Cosmos Redshift 7 galaxy at z = 6.60.¹¹⁰ ¹¹¹

With a mass only 80 times that of Jupiter (MJ), 2MASS J0523-1403 is the
smallest known star undergoing nuclear fusion in its core.¹¹² For stars
with similar metallicity to the Sun, the theoretical minimum mass the star
can have, and still undergo fusion at the core, is estimated to be about 75
MJ.¹¹³ ¹¹⁴ When the metallicity is very low, however, a recent study of the
faintest stars found that the minimum star size seems to be about 8.3% of
the solar mass, or about 87 MJ.¹¹⁴ ¹¹⁵ Smaller bodies are called brown
dwarfs, which occupy a poorly defined grey area between stars and gas
giants.

The combination of the radius and the mass of a star determines the surface
gravity. Giant stars have a much lower surface gravity than main sequence
stars, while the opposite is the case for degenerate, compact stars such as
white dwarfs. The surface gravity can influence the appearance of a star's
spectrum, with higher gravity causing a broadening of the absorption
lines.³³

Rotation

Main article: Stellar rotation

The rotation rate of stars can be determined through spectroscopic
measurement, or more exactly determined by tracking the rotation rate of
starspots. Young stars can have a rapid rate of rotation greater than 100
km/s at the equator. The B-class star Achernar, for example, has an
equatorial rotation velocity of about 225 km/s or greater, causing its
equator to be slung outward and giving it an equatorial diameter that is
more than 50% larger than the distance between the poles. This rate of
rotation is just below the critical velocity of 300 km/s where the star
would break apart.¹¹⁶ By contrast, the Sun only rotates once every 25 – 35
days, with an equatorial velocity of 1.994 km/s. The star's magnetic field
and the stellar wind serve to slow a main sequence star's rate of rotation
by a significant amount as it evolves on the main sequence.¹¹⁷

Degenerate stars have contracted into a compact mass, resulting in a rapid
rate of rotation. However they have relatively low rates of rotation
compared to what would be expected by conservation of angular momentum—the
tendency of a rotating body to compensate for a contraction in size by
increasing its rate of spin. A large portion of the star's angular momentum
is dissipated as a result of mass loss through the stellar wind.¹¹⁸ In
spite of this, the rate of rotation for a pulsar can be very rapid. The
pulsar at the heart of the Crab nebula, for example, rotates 30 times per
second.¹¹⁹ The rotation rate of the pulsar will gradually slow due to the
emission of radiation.

Temperature

The surface temperature of a main sequence star is determined by the rate
of energy production at the core and by its radius, and is often estimated
from the star's color index.¹²⁰ The temperature is normally given as the
effective temperature, which is the temperature of an idealized black body
that radiates its energy at the same luminosity per surface area as the
star. Note that the effective temperature is only a representative value,
as the temperature increases toward the core.¹²¹ The temperature in the
core region of a star is several million kelvins.¹²²

The stellar temperature will determine the rate of ionization of various
elements, resulting in characteristic absorption lines in the spectrum. The
surface temperature of a star, along with its visual absolute magnitude and
absorption features, is used to classify a star (see classification
below).³³

Massive main sequence stars can have surface temperatures of 50,000 K.
Smaller stars such as the Sun have surface temperatures of a few thousand
K. Red giants have relatively low surface temperatures of about 3,600 K;
but they also have a high luminosity due to their large exterior surface
area.¹²³

Radiation

The energy produced by stars, as a product of nuclear fusion, radiates into
space as both electromagnetic radiation and particle radiation. The
particle radiation emitted by a star is manifested as the stellar wind,¹²⁴
which streams from the outer layers as electrically charged protons and
alpha and beta particles. Although almost massless there also exists a
steady stream of neutrinos emanating from the star's core.

The production of energy at the core is the reason stars shine so brightly:
every time two or more atomic nuclei fuse together to form a single atomic
nucleus of a new heavier element, gamma ray photons are released from the
nuclear fusion product. This energy is converted to other forms of
electromagnetic energy of lower frequency, such as visible light, by the
time it reaches the star's outer layers.

The color of a star, as determined by the most intense frequency of the
visible light, depends on the temperature of the star's outer layers,
including its photosphere.¹²⁵ Besides visible light, stars also emit forms
of electromagnetic radiation that are invisible to the human eye. In fact,
stellar electromagnetic radiation spans the entire electromagnetic
spectrum, from the longest wavelengths of radio waves through infrared,
visible light, ultraviolet, to the shortest of X-rays, and gamma rays. From
the standpoint of total energy emitted by a star, not all components of
stellar electromagnetic radiation are significant, but all frequencies
provide insight into the star's physics.

Using the stellar spectrum, astronomers can also determine the surface
temperature, surface gravity, metallicity and rotational velocity of a
star. If the distance of the star is known, such as by measuring the
parallax, then the luminosity of the star can be derived. The mass, radius,
surface gravity, and rotation period can then be estimated based on stellar
models. (Mass can be calculated for stars in binary systems by measuring
their orbital velocities and distances. Gravitational microlensing has been
used to measure the mass of a single star.¹²⁶ ) With these parameters,
astronomers can also estimate the age of the star.¹²⁷

Luminosity

The luminosity of a star is the amount of light and other forms of radiant
energy it radiates per unit of time. It has units of power. The luminosity
of a star is determined by the radius and the surface temperature. However,
many stars do not radiate a uniform flux (the amount of energy radiated per
unit area) across their entire surface. The rapidly rotating star Vega, for
example, has a higher energy flux at its poles than along its equator.¹²⁸

Surface patches with a lower temperature and luminosity than average are
known as starspots. Small, dwarf stars such as our Sun generally have
essentially featureless disks with only small starspots. Larger, giant
stars have much larger, more obvious starspots,¹²⁹ and they also exhibit
strong stellar limb darkening. That is, the brightness decreases towards
the edge of the stellar disk.¹³⁰ Red dwarf flare stars such as UV Ceti may
also possess prominent starspot features.¹³¹

Magnitude

Main articles: Apparent magnitude and Absolute magnitude

The apparent brightness of a star is expressed in terms of its apparent
magnitude, which is the brightness of a star and is a function of the
star's luminosity, distance from Earth, and the altering of the star's
light as it passes through Earth's atmosphere. Intrinsic or absolute
magnitude is directly related to a star's luminosity, and is what the
apparent magnitude a star would be if the distance between the Earth and
the star were 10 parsecs (32.6 light-years).

Both the apparent and absolute magnitude scales are logarithmic units: one
whole number difference in magnitude is equal to a brightness variation of
about 2.5 times¹³³ (the 5th root of 100 or approximately 2.512). This means
that a first magnitude star (+1.00) is about 2.5 times brighter than a
second magnitude (+2.00) star, and approximately 100 times brighter than a
sixth magnitude star (+6.00). The faintest stars visible to the naked eye
under good seeing conditions are about magnitude +6.

On both apparent and absolute magnitude scales, the smaller the magnitude
number, the brighter the star; the larger the magnitude number, the
fainter. The brightest stars, on either scale, have negative magnitude
numbers. The variation in brightness (ΔL) between two stars is calculated
by subtracting the magnitude number of the brighter star (mb) from the
magnitude number of the fainter star (mf), then using the difference as an
exponent for the base number 2.512; that is to say:

Δ = m_\mathrm{f} - m_\mathrm{b}
2.512^{Δ} = Δ

Relative to both luminosity and distance from Earth, a star's absolute
magnitude (M) and apparent magnitude (m) are not equivalent;¹³³ for
example, the bright star Sirius has an apparent magnitude of −1.44, but it
has an absolute magnitude of +1.41.

The Sun has an apparent magnitude of −26.7, but its absolute magnitude is
only +4.83. Sirius, the brightest star in the night sky as seen from Earth,
is approximately 23 times more luminous than the Sun, while Canopus, the
second brightest star in the night sky with an absolute magnitude of −5.53,
is approximately 14,000 times more luminous than the Sun. Despite Canopus
being vastly more luminous than Sirius, however, Sirius appears brighter
than Canopus. This is because Sirius is merely 8.6 light-years from the
Earth, while Canopus is much farther away at a distance of 310 light-years.

As of 2006, the star with the highest known absolute magnitude is LBV
1806-20, with a magnitude of −14.2. This star is at least 5,000,000 times
more luminous than the Sun.¹³⁴ The least luminous stars that are currently
known are located in the NGC 6397 cluster. The faintest red dwarfs in the
cluster were magnitude 26, while a 28th magnitude white dwarf was also
discovered. These faint stars are so dim that their light is as bright as a
birthday candle on the Moon when viewed from the Earth.¹³⁵

Classification

Main article: Stellar classification

The current stellar classification system originated in the early 20th
century, when stars were classified from A to Q based on the strength of
the hydrogen line.¹³⁷ It was not known at the time that the major influence
on the line strength was temperature; the hydrogen line strength reaches a
peak at over 9000 K, and is weaker at both hotter and cooler temperatures.
When the classifications were reordered by temperature, it more closely
resembled the modern scheme.¹³⁸

Stars are given a single-letter classification according to their spectra,
ranging from type O, which are very hot, to M, which are so cool that
molecules may form in their atmospheres. The main classifications in order
of decreasing surface temperature are: O, B, A, F, G, K, and M. A variety
of rare spectral types have special classifications. The most common of
these are types L and T, which classify the coldest low-mass stars and
brown dwarfs. Each letter has 10 sub-divisions, numbered from 0 to 9, in
order of decreasing temperature. However, this system breaks down at
extreme high temperatures: class O0 and O1 stars may not exist.¹³⁹

In addition, stars may be classified by the luminosity effects found in
their spectral lines, which correspond to their spatial size and is
determined by the surface gravity. These range from 0 (hypergiants) through
III (giants) to V (main sequence dwarfs); some authors add VII (white
dwarfs). Most stars belong to the main sequence, which consists of ordinary
hydrogen-burning stars. These fall along a narrow, diagonal band when
graphed according to their absolute magnitude and spectral type.¹³⁹ The Sun
is a main sequence G2V yellow dwarf of intermediate temperature and
ordinary size.

Additional nomenclature, in the form of lower-case letters, can follow the
spectral type to indicate peculiar features of the spectrum. For example,
an "e" can indicate the presence of emission lines; "m" represents
unusually strong levels of metals, and "var" can mean variations in the
spectral type.¹³⁹

White dwarf stars have their own class that begins with the letter D. This
is further sub-divided into the classes DA, DB, DC, DO, DZ, and DQ,
depending on the types of prominent lines found in the spectrum. This is
followed by a numerical value that indicates the temperature index.¹⁴⁰

Variable stars

Main article: Variable star

Variable stars have periodic or random changes in luminosity because of
intrinsic or extrinsic properties. Of the intrinsically variable stars, the
primary types can be subdivided into three principal groups.

During their stellar evolution, some stars pass through phases where they
can become pulsating variables. Pulsating variable stars vary in radius and
luminosity over time, expanding and contracting with periods ranging from
minutes to years, depending on the size of the star. This category includes
Cepheid and Cepheid-like stars, and long-period variables such as Mira.¹⁴¹

Eruptive variables are stars that experience sudden increases in luminosity
because of flares or mass ejection events.¹⁴¹ This group includes
protostars, Wolf-Rayet stars, and flare stars, as well as giant and
supergiant stars.

Cataclysmic or explosive variable stars are those that undergo a dramatic
change in their properties. This group includes novae and supernovae. A
binary star system that includes a nearby white dwarf can produce certain
types of these spectacular stellar explosions, including the nova and a
Type 1a supernova.⁴ The explosion is created when the white dwarf accretes
hydrogen from the companion star, building up mass until the hydrogen
undergoes fusion.¹⁴² Some novae are also recurrent, having periodic
outbursts of moderate amplitude.¹⁴¹

Stars can also vary in luminosity because of extrinsic factors, such as
eclipsing binaries, as well as rotating stars that produce extreme
starspots.¹⁴¹ A notable example of an eclipsing binary is Algol, which
regularly varies in magnitude from 2.3 to 3.5 over a period of 2.87 days.

Structure

Main article: Stellar structure

The interior of a stable star is in a state of hydrostatic equilibrium: the
forces on any small volume almost exactly counterbalance each other. The
balanced forces are inward gravitational force and an outward force due to
the pressure gradient within the star. The pressure gradient is established
by the temperature gradient of the plasma; the outer part of the star is
cooler than the core. The temperature at the core of a main sequence or
giant star is at least on the order of 10⁷ K. The resulting temperature and
pressure at the hydrogen-burning core of a main sequence star are
sufficient for nuclear fusion to occur and for sufficient energy to be
produced to prevent further collapse of the star.¹⁴³ ¹⁴⁴

As atomic nuclei are fused in the core, they emit energy in the form of
gamma rays. These photons interact with the surrounding plasma, adding to
the thermal energy at the core. Stars on the main sequence convert hydrogen
into helium, creating a slowly but steadily increasing proportion of helium
in the core. Eventually the helium content becomes predominant, and energy
production ceases at the core. Instead, for stars of more than 0.4 M☉,
fusion occurs in a slowly expanding shell around the degenerate helium
core.¹⁴⁵

In addition to hydrostatic equilibrium, the interior of a stable star will
also maintain an energy balance of thermal equilibrium. There is a radial
temperature gradient throughout the interior that results in a flux of
energy flowing toward the exterior. The outgoing flux of energy leaving any
layer within the star will exactly match the incoming flux from below.

The radiation zone is the region within the stellar interior where
radiative transfer is sufficiently efficient to maintain the flux of
energy. In this region the plasma will not be perturbed, and any mass
motions will die out. If this is not the case, however, then the plasma
becomes unstable and convection will occur, forming a convection zone. This
can occur, for example, in regions where very high energy fluxes occur,
such as near the core or in areas with high opacity as in the outer
envelope.¹⁴⁴

The occurrence of convection in the outer envelope of a main sequence star
depends on the mass. Stars with several times the mass of the Sun have a
convection zone deep within the interior and a radiative zone in the outer
layers. Smaller stars such as the Sun are just the opposite, with the
convective zone located in the outer layers.¹⁴⁶ Red dwarf stars with less
than 0.4 M☉ are convective throughout, which prevents the accumulation of a
helium core.² For most stars the convective zones will also vary over time
as the star ages and the constitution of the interior is modified.¹⁴⁴

The portion of a star that is visible to an observer is called the
photosphere. This is the layer at which the plasma of the star becomes
transparent to photons of light. From here, the energy generated at the
core becomes free to propagate out into space. It is within the photosphere
that sun spots, or regions of lower than average temperature, appear.

Above the level of the photosphere is the stellar atmosphere. In a main
sequence star such as the Sun, the lowest level of the atmosphere is the
thin chromosphere region, where spicules appear and stellar flares begin.
This is surrounded by a transition region, where the temperature rapidly
increases within a distance of only 100 km (62 mi). Beyond this is the
corona, a volume of super-heated plasma that can extend outward to several
million kilometres.¹⁴⁷ The existence of a corona appears to be dependent on
a convective zone in the outer layers of the star.¹⁴⁶ Despite its high
temperature, the corona emits very little light. The corona region of the
Sun is normally only visible during a solar eclipse.

From the corona, a stellar wind of plasma particles expands outward from
the star, propagating until it interacts with the interstellar medium. For
the Sun, the influence of its solar wind extends throughout the
bubble-shaped region of the heliosphere.¹⁴⁸

Nuclear fusion reaction pathways

Main article: Stellar nucleosynthesis
Overview of the proton-proton chain
The carbon-nitrogen-oxygen cycle

A variety of different nuclear fusion reactions take place inside the cores
of stars, depending upon their mass and composition, as part of stellar
nucleosynthesis. The net mass of the fused atomic nuclei is smaller than
the sum of the constituents. This lost mass is released as electromagnetic
energy, according to the mass-energy equivalence relationship E = mc².¹

The hydrogen fusion process is temperature-sensitive, so a moderate
increase in the core temperature will result in a significant increase in
the fusion rate. As a result, the core temperature of main sequence stars
only varies from 4 million kelvin for a small M-class star to 40 million
kelvin for a massive O-class star.¹²²

In the Sun, with a 10-million-kelvin core, hydrogen fuses to form helium in
the proton-proton chain reaction:¹⁴⁹

  4¹H → 2²H + 2e⁺ + 2νₑ(2 x 0.4 MeV)2e⁺ + 2e⁻ → 2γ (2 x 1.0 MeV)2¹H + 2²H →
  2³He + 2γ (2 x 5.5 MeV)2³He → ⁴He + 2¹H (12.9 MeV)

These reactions result in the overall reaction:

  4¹H → ⁴He + 2e⁺ + 2γ + 2νₑ (26.7 MeV)

where e⁺ is a positron, γ is a gamma ray photon, νₑ is a neutrino, and H
and He are isotopes of hydrogen and helium, respectively. The energy
released by this reaction is in millions of electron volts, which is
actually only a tiny amount of energy. However enormous numbers of these
reactions occur constantly, producing all the energy necessary to sustain
the star's radiation output.

In more massive stars, helium is produced in a cycle of reactions catalyzed
by carbon—the carbon-nitrogen-oxygen cycle.¹⁴⁹

In evolved stars with cores at 100 million kelvin and masses between 0.5
and 10 M☉, helium can be transformed into carbon in the triple-alpha
process that uses the intermediate element beryllium:¹⁴⁹

  ⁴He + ⁴He + 92 keV → 8*Be⁴He + 8*Be + 67 keV → 12*C12*C → ¹²C + γ + 7.4
  MeV

For an overall reaction of:

  3⁴He → ¹²C + γ + 7.2 MeV

In massive stars, heavier elements can also be burned in a contracting core
through the neon burning process and oxygen burning process. The final
stage in the stellar nucleosynthesis process is the silicon burning process
that results in the production of the stable isotope iron-56. Fusion can
not proceed any further except through an endothermic process, and so
further energy can only be produced through gravitational collapse.¹⁴⁹

The example below shows the amount of time required for a star of 20 M☉ to
consume all of its nuclear fuel. As an O-class main sequence star, it would
be 8 times the solar radius and 62,000 times the Sun's luminosity.¹⁵¹

Star formation

Star formation is the process by which dense regions within molecular
clouds in interstellar space, sometimes referred to as "stellar nurseries"
or "star-forming regions", collapse to form stars. As a branch of
astronomy, star formation includes the study of the interstellar medium
(ISM) and giant molecular clouds (GMC) as precursors to the star formation
process, and the study of protostars and young stellar objects as its
immediate products. It is closely related to planet formation, another
branch of astronomy. Star formation theory, as well as accounting for the
formation of a single star, must also account for the statistics of binary
stars and the initial mass function.

In June 2015, astronomers reported evidence for Population III stars in the
Cosmos Redshift 7 galaxy at z = 6.60. Such stars are likely to have existed
in the very early universe (i.e., at high redshift), and may have started
the production of chemical elements heavier than hydrogen that are needed
for the later formation of planets and life as we know it.¹ ²

Stellar nurseries

Interstellar clouds

A spiral galaxy like the Milky Way contains stars, stellar remnants, and a
diffuse interstellar medium (ISM) of gas and dust. The interstellar medium
consists of 10−4 to 10⁶ particles per cm³ and is typically composed of
roughly 70% hydrogen by mass, with most of the remaining gas consisting of
helium. This medium has been chemically enriched by trace amounts of
heavier elements that were ejected from stars as they passed beyond the end
of their main sequence lifetime. Higher density regions of the interstellar
medium form clouds, or diffuse nebulae,³ where star formation takes place.⁴
In contrast to spirals, an elliptical galaxy loses the cold component of
its interstellar medium within roughly a billion years, which hinders the
galaxy from forming diffuse nebulae except through mergers with other
galaxies.⁵

In the dense nebulae where stars are produced, much of the hydrogen is in
the molecular (H₂) form, so these nebulae are called molecular clouds.⁴
Observations indicate that the coldest clouds tend to form low-mass stars,
observed first in the infrared inside the clouds, then in visible light at
their surface when the clouds dissipate, while giant molecular clouds,
which are generally warmer, produce stars of all masses.⁶ These giant
molecular clouds have typical densities of 100 particles per cm³, diameters
of 100 light-years (9.5×10¹⁴ km), masses of up to 6 million solar masses
(M☉),⁷ and an average interior temperature of 10 K. About half the total
mass of the galactic ISM is found in molecular clouds⁸ and in the Milky Way
there are an estimated 6,000 molecular clouds, each with more than 100,000
M☉.⁹ The nearest nebula to the Sun where massive stars are being formed is
the Orion nebula, 1,300 ly (1.2×10¹⁶ km) away.¹⁰ However, lower mass star
formation is occurring about 400–450 light years distant in the ρ Ophiuchi
cloud complex.¹¹

A more compact site of star formation is the opaque clouds of dense gas and
dust known as Bok globules; so named after the astronomer Bart Bok. These
can form in association with collapsing molecular clouds or possibly
independently.¹² The Bok globules are typically up to a light year across
and contain a few solar masses.¹³ They can be observed as dark clouds
silhouetted against bright emission nebulae or background stars. Over half
the known Bok globules have been found to contain newly forming stars.¹⁴

The first observed newborn star-forming clump, aged less than 10 million
years old, was found in a galaxy about a corresponding light travel
distance of 10.4 billion light years away, at an age when the universe was
about 3.3 billion years old. The clump is about 3,000 light-years wide, and
has a mass more than 1 billion times the mass of the sun, creating 32 stars
each year with the mass of the sun, and produced about 40 percent of the
stars in the clump's host galaxy.

Initial research indicates star-forming clumps start as giant, dense areas
in turbulent gas-rich matter in young galaxies, live about 500 million
years, and may migrate to the center of a galaxy, creating the central
bulge of a galaxy.¹⁶

Cloud collapse

An interstellar cloud of gas will remain in hydrostatic equilibrium as long
as the kinetic energy of the gas pressure is in balance with the potential
energy of the internal gravitational force. Mathematically this is
expressed using the virial theorem, which states that, to maintain
equilibrium, the gravitational potential energy must equal twice the
internal thermal energy.¹⁷ If a cloud is massive enough that the gas
pressure is insufficient to support it, the cloud will undergo
gravitational collapse. The mass above which a cloud will undergo such
collapse is called the Jeans mass. The Jeans mass depends on the
temperature and density of the cloud, but is typically thousands to tens of
thousands of solar masses.⁴ This coincides with the typical mass of an open
cluster of stars, which is the end product of a collapsing cloud.¹⁸

In triggered star formation, one of several events might occur to compress
a molecular cloud and initiate its gravitational collapse. Molecular clouds
may collide with each other, or a nearby supernova explosion can be a
trigger, sending shocked matter into the cloud at very high speeds.⁴
Alternatively, galactic collisions can trigger massive starbursts of star
formation as the gas clouds in each galaxy are compressed and agitated by
tidal forces.¹⁹ The latter mechanism may be responsible for the formation
of globular clusters.²⁰

A supermassive black hole at the core of a galaxy may serve to regulate the
rate of star formation in a galactic nucleus. A black hole that is
accreting infalling matter can become active, emitting a strong wind
through a collimated relativistic jet. This can limit further star
formation. Massive black holes ejecting radio-frequency-emitting particles
at near-light speed can also block the formation of new stars in aging
galaxies.²¹ However, the radio emissions around the jets may also trigger
star formation. Likewise, a weaker jet may trigger star formation when it
collides with a cloud.²²

As it collapses, a molecular cloud breaks into smaller and smaller pieces
in a hierarchical manner, until the fragments reach stellar mass. In each
of these fragments, the collapsing gas radiates away the energy gained by
the release of gravitational potential energy. As the density increases,
the fragments become opaque and are thus less efficient at radiating away
their energy. This raises the temperature of the cloud and inhibits further
fragmentation. The fragments now condense into rotating spheres of gas that
serve as stellar embryos.²³

Complicating this picture of a collapsing cloud are the effects of
turbulence, macroscopic flows, rotation, magnetic fields and the cloud
geometry. Both rotation and magnetic fields can hinder the collapse of a
cloud.²⁴ ²⁵ Turbulence is instrumental in causing fragmentation of the
cloud, and on the smallest scales it promotes collapse.²⁶

Protostar

Main article: Protostar

A protostellar cloud will continue to collapse as long as the gravitational
binding energy can be eliminated. This excess energy is primarily lost
through radiation. However, the collapsing cloud will eventually become
opaque to its own radiation, and the energy must be removed through some
other means. The dust within the cloud becomes heated to temperatures of
60–100 K, and these particles radiate at wavelengths in the far infrared
where the cloud is transparent. Thus the dust mediates the further collapse
of the cloud.²⁷

During the collapse, the density of the cloud increases toward the center
and thus the middle region becomes optically opaque first. This occurs when
the density is about 10−13 g / cm³. A core region, called the First
Hydrostatic Core, forms where the collapse is essentially halted. It
continues to increase in temperature as determined by the virial theorem.
The gas falling toward this opaque region collides with it and creates
shock waves that further heat the core.²⁸

When the core temperature reaches about 2000 K, the thermal energy
dissociates the H₂ molecules.²⁸ This is followed by the ionization of the
hydrogen and helium atoms. These processes absorb the energy of the
contraction, allowing it to continue on timescales comparable to the period
of collapse at free fall velocities.²⁹ After the density of infalling
material has dropped below about 10−8 g / cm³, that material is
sufficiently transparent to allow energy radiated by the protostar to
escape. The combination of convection within the protostar and radiation
from its exterior allow the star to contract further.²⁸ This continues
until the gas is hot enough for the internal pressure to support the
protostar against further gravitational collapse—a state called hydrostatic
equilibrium. When this accretion phase is nearly complete, the resulting
object is known as a protostar.⁴

Accretion of material onto the protostar continues partially from the newly
formed circumstellar disc. When the density and temperature are high
enough, deuterium fusion begins, and the outward pressure of the resultant
radiation slows (but does not stop) the collapse. Material comprising the
cloud continues to "rain" onto the protostar. In this stage bipolar jets
are produced called Herbig-Haro objects. This is probably the means by
which excess angular momentum of the infalling material is expelled,
allowing the star to continue to form.

When the surrounding gas and dust envelope disperses and accretion process
stops, the star is considered a pre–main sequence star (PMS star). The
energy source of these objects is gravitational contraction, as opposed to
hydrogen burning in main sequence stars. The PMS star follows a Hayashi
track on the Hertzsprung–Russell (H–R) diagram.³⁰ The contraction will
proceed until the Hayashi limit is reached, and thereafter contraction will
continue on a Kelvin–Helmholtz timescale with the temperature remaining
stable. Stars with less than 0.5 M☉ thereafter join the main sequence. For
more massive PMS stars, at the end of the Hayashi track they will slowly
collapse in near hydrostatic equilibrium, following the Henyey track.³¹

Finally, hydrogen begins to fuse in the core of the star, and the rest of
the enveloping material is cleared away. This ends the protostellar phase
and begins the star's main sequence phase on the H–R diagram.

The stages of the process are well defined in stars with masses around 1 M☉
or less. In high mass stars, the length of the star formation process is
comparable to the other timescales of their evolution, much shorter, and
the process is not so well defined. The later evolution of stars are
studied in stellar evolution.

Observations

Key elements of star formation are only available by observing in
wavelengths other than the optical. The protostellar stage of stellar
existence is almost invariably hidden away deep inside dense clouds of gas
and dust left over from the GMC. Often, these star-forming cocoons known as
Bok globules, can be seen in silhouette against bright emission from
surrounding gas.³² Early stages of a star's life can be seen in infrared
light, which penetrates the dust more easily than visible light.³³
Observations from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) have thus
been especially important for unveiling numerous Galactic protostars and
their parent star clusters.³⁴ ³⁵ Examples of such embedded star clusters
are FSR 1184, FSR 1190, Camargo 14, Camargo 74, Majaess 64, and Majaess
98.³⁶

The structure of the molecular cloud and the effects of the protostar can
be observed in near-IR extinction maps (where the number of stars are
counted per unit area and compared to a nearby zero extinction area of
sky), continuum dust emission and rotational transitions of CO and other
molecules; these last two are observed in the millimeter and submillimeter
range. The radiation from the protostar and early star has to be observed
in infrared astronomy wavelengths, as the extinction caused by the rest of
the cloud in which the star is forming is usually too big to allow us to
observe it in the visual part of the spectrum. This presents considerable
difficulties as the Earth's atmosphere is almost entirely opaque from 20μm
to 850μm, with narrow windows at 200μm and 450μm. Even outside this range,
atmospheric subtraction techniques must be used.

The formation of individual stars can only be directly observed in the
Milky Way Galaxy, but in distant galaxies star formation has been detected
through its unique spectral signature.

On February 21, 2014, NASA announced a greatly upgraded database for
tracking polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the universe. According
to scientists, more than 20% of the carbon in the universe may be
associated with PAHs, possible starting materials for the formation of
life. PAHs seem to have been formed shortly after the Big Bang, are
widespread throughout the universe, and are associated with new stars and
exoplanets.³⁷

Notable pathfinder objects

Stars of different masses are thought to form by slightly different
mechanisms. The theory of low-mass star formation, which is well-supported
by a plethora of observations, suggests that low-mass stars form by the
gravitational collapse of rotating density enhancements within molecular
clouds. As described above, the collapse of a rotating cloud of gas and
dust leads to the formation of an accretion disk through which matter is
channeled onto a central protostar. For stars with masses higher than about
8 M☉, however, the mechanism of star formation is not well understood.

Massive stars emit copious quantities of radiation which pushes against
infalling material. In the past, it was thought that this radiation
pressure might be substantial enough to halt accretion onto the massive
protostar and prevent the formation of stars with masses more than a few
tens of solar masses.³⁹ Recent theoretical work has shown that the
production of a jet and outflow clears a cavity through which much of the
radiation from a massive protostar can escape without hindering accretion
through the disk and onto the protostar.⁴⁰ ⁴¹ Present thinking is that
massive stars may therefore be able to form by a mechanism similar to that
by which low mass stars form.

There is mounting evidence that at least some massive protostars are indeed
surrounded by accretion disks. Several other theories of massive star
formation remain to be tested observationally. Of these, perhaps the most
prominent is the theory of competitive accretion, which suggests that
massive protostars are "seeded" by low-mass protostars which compete with
other protostars to draw in matter from the entire parent molecular cloud,
instead of simply from a small local region.⁴² ⁴³

Another theory of massive star formation suggests that massive stars may
form by the coalescence of two or more stars of lower mass.⁴⁴

Stellar evolution

Stellar evolution is the process by which a star changes during its
lifetime. Depending on the mass of the star, this lifetime ranges from a
few million years for the most massive to trillions of years for the least
massive, which is considerably longer than the age of the universe. The
table shows the lifetimes of stars as a function of their masses.¹ All
stars are born from collapsing clouds of gas and dust, often called nebulae
or molecular clouds. Over the course of millions of years, these protostars
settle down into a state of equilibrium, becoming what is known as a
main-sequence star.

Nuclear fusion powers a star for most of its life. Initially the energy is
generated by the fusion of hydrogen atoms at the core of the main-sequence
star. Later, as the preponderance of atoms at the core becomes helium,
stars like the Sun begin to fuse hydrogen along a spherical shell
surrounding the core. This process causes the star to gradually grow in
size, passing through the subgiant stage until it reaches the red giant
phase. Stars with at least half the mass of the Sun can also begin to
generate energy through the fusion of helium at their core, whereas
more-massive stars can fuse heavier elements along a series of concentric
shells. Once a star like the Sun has exhausted its nuclear fuel, its core
collapses into a dense white dwarf and the outer layers are expelled as a
planetary nebula. Stars with around ten or more times the mass of the Sun
can explode in a supernova as their inert iron cores collapse into an
extremely dense neutron star or black hole. Although the universe is not
old enough for any of the smallest red dwarfs to have reached the end of
their lives, stellar models suggest they will slowly become brighter and
hotter before running out of hydrogen fuel and becoming low-mass white
dwarfs.²

Stellar evolution is not studied by observing the life of a single star, as
most stellar changes occur too slowly to be detected, even over many
centuries. Instead, astrophysicists come to understand how stars evolve by
observing numerous stars at various points in their lifetime, and by
simulating stellar structure using computer models.

In June 2015, astronomers reported evidence for Population III stars in the
Cosmos Redshift 7 galaxy at z = 6.60. Such stars are likely to have existed
in the very early universe (i.e., at high redshift), and may have started
the production of chemical elements heavier than hydrogen that are needed
for the later formation of planets and life as we know it.³ ⁴

Birth of a star

Main article: Star formation

Protostar

Stellar evolution starts with the gravitational collapse of a giant
molecular cloud. Typical giant molecular clouds are roughly 100 light-years
(9.5×10¹⁴ km) across and contain up to 6,000,000 solar masses (1.2×10³⁷
kg). As it collapses, a giant molecular cloud breaks into smaller and
smaller pieces. In each of these fragments, the collapsing gas releases
gravitational potential energy as heat. As its temperature and pressure
increase, a fragment condenses into a rotating sphere of superhot gas known
as a protostar.⁵

A protostar continues to grow by accretion of gas and dust from the
molecular cloud, becoming a pre-main-sequence star as it reaches its final
mass. Further development is determined by its mass. (Mass is compared to
the mass of the Sun: 1.0 M☉ (2.0×10³⁰ kg) means 1 solar mass.)

Protostars are encompassed in dust, and are thus more readily visible at
infrared wavelengths. Observations from the Wide-field Infrared Survey
Explorer (WISE) have been especially important for unveiling numerous
Galactic protostars and their parent star clusters.⁶ ⁷

Brown dwarfs and sub-stellar objects

Protostars with masses less than roughly 0.08 M☉ (1.6×10²⁹ kg) never reach
temperatures high enough for nuclear fusion of hydrogen to begin. These are
known as brown dwarfs. The International Astronomical Union defines brown
dwarfs as stars massive enough to fuse deuterium at some point in their
lives (13 Jupiter masses (MJ), 2.5 × 10²⁸ kg, or 0.0125 M☉). Objects
smaller than 13 MJ are classified as sub-brown dwarfs (but if they orbit
around another stellar object they are classified as planets).⁸ Both types,
deuterium-burning and not, shine dimly and die away slowly, cooling
gradually over hundreds of millions of years.

Hydrogen fusion

For a more-massive protostar, the core temperature will eventually reach 10
million kelvin, initiating the proton–proton chain reaction and allowing
hydrogen to fuse, first to deuterium and then to helium. In stars of
slightly over 1 M☉ (2.0×10³⁰ kg), the carbon–nitrogen–oxygen fusion
reaction (CNO cycle) contributes a large portion of the energy generation.
The onset of nuclear fusion leads relatively quickly to a hydrostatic
equilibrium in which energy released by the core exerts a "radiation
pressure" balancing the weight of the star's matter, preventing further
gravitational collapse. The star thus evolves rapidly to a stable state,
beginning the main-sequence phase of its evolution.

A new star will sit at a specific point on the main sequence of the
Hertzsprung–Russell diagram, with the main-sequence spectral type depending
upon the mass of the star. Small, relatively cold, low-mass red dwarfs fuse
hydrogen slowly and will remain on the main sequence for hundreds of
billions of years or longer, whereas massive, hot O-type stars will leave
the main sequence after just a few million years. A mid-sized yellow dwarf
star, like the Sun, will remain on the main sequence for about 10 billion
years. The Sun is thought to be in the middle of its main sequence
lifespan.

The evolutionary tracks of stars with different initial masses on the
Hertzsprung–Russell diagram. The tracks start once the star has evolved to
the main sequence and stop when fusion stops (for massive stars) and at the
end of the red giant branch (for stars 1 M☉ and less).⁹
A yellow track is shown for the Sun, which will become a red giant after
its main-sequence phase ends before expanding further along the asymptotic
giant branch, which will be the last phase in which the Sun undergoes
fusion.

Mature stars

Eventually the core exhausts its supply of hydrogen and the star begins to
evolve off of the main sequence. Without the outward pressure generated by
the fusion of hydrogen to counteract the force of gravity the core
contracts until either electron degeneracy pressure becomes sufficient to
oppose gravity or the core becomes hot enough (around 100 MK) for helium
fusion to begin. Which of these happens first depends upon the star's mass.

Low-mass stars

What happens after a low-mass star ceases to produce energy through fusion
has not been directly observed; the universe is around 13.8 billion years
old, which is less time (by several orders of magnitude, in some cases)
than it takes for fusion to cease in such stars.

Recent astrophysical models suggest that red dwarfs of 0.1 M☉ may stay on
the main sequence for some six to twelve trillion years, gradually
increasing in both temperature and luminosity, and take several hundred
billion more to collapse, slowly, into a white dwarf.¹⁰ ¹¹ Such stars will
not become red giants as they are fully convective and will not develop a
degenerate helium core with a shell burning hydrogen. Instead, hydrogen
fusion will proceed until almost the whole star is helium.

Slightly more massive stars do expand into red giants, but their helium
cores are not massive enough to reach the temperatures required for helium
fusion so they never reach the tip of the red giant branch. When hydrogen
shell burning finishes, these stars move directly off the red giant branch
like a post AGB star, but at lower luminosity, to become a white dwarf.² A
star of about 0.5 M☉ will be able to reach temperatures high enough to fuse
helium, and these "mid-sized" stars go on to further stages of evolution
beyond the red giant branch.¹²

Mid-sized stars

Stars of roughly 0.5–10 M☉ become red giants, which are large
non-main-sequence stars of stellar classification K or M. Red giants lie
along the right edge of the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram due to their red
color and large luminosity. Examples include Aldebaran in the constellation
Taurus and Arcturus in the constellation of Boötes. Red giants all have
inert cores with hydrogen-burning shells: concentric layers atop the core
that are still fusing hydrogen into helium.

Mid-sized stars are red giants during two different phases of their
post-main-sequence evolution: red-giant-branch stars, whose inert cores are
made of helium, and asymptotic-giant-branch stars, whose inert cores are
made of carbon. Asymptotic-giant-branch stars have helium-burning shells
inside the hydrogen-burning shells, whereas red-giant-branch stars have
hydrogen-burning shells only.¹³ In either case, the accelerated fusion in
the hydrogen-containing layer immediately over the core causes the star to
expand. This lifts the outer layers away from the core, reducing the
gravitational pull on them, and they expand faster than the energy
production increases. This causes the outer layers of the star to cool,
which causes the star to become redder than it was on the main sequence.

Red-giant-branch phase

The red-giant-branch phase of a star's life follows the main sequence.
Initially, the cores of red-giant-branch stars collapse, as the internal
pressure of the core is insufficient to balance gravity. This gravitational
collapse releases energy, heating concentric shells immediately outside the
inert helium core so that hydrogen fusion continues in these shells. The
core of a red-giant-branch star of up to a few solar masses stops
collapsing when it is dense enough to be supported by electron degeneracy
pressure. Once this occurs, the core reaches hydrostatic equilibrium: the
electron degeneracy pressure is sufficient to balance gravitational
pressure.¹⁴ The core's gravity compresses the hydrogen in the layer
immediately above it, causing it to fuse faster than hydrogen would fuse in
a main-sequence star of the same mass. This in turn causes the star to
become more luminous (from 1,000–10,000 times brighter) and expand; the
degree of expansion outstrips the increase in luminosity, causing the
effective temperature to decrease.

The expanding outer layers of the star are convective, with the material
being mixed by turbulence from near the fusing regions up to the surface of
the star. For all but the lowest-mass stars, the fused material has
remained deep in the stellar interior prior to this point, so the
convecting envelope makes fusion products visible at the star's surface for
the first time. At this stage of evolution, the results are subtle, with
the largest effects, alterations to the isotopes of hydrogen and helium,
being unobservable. The effects of the CNO cycle appear at the surface,
with lower ¹²C/¹³C ratios and altered proportions of carbon and nitrogen.
These are detectable with spectroscopy and have been measured for many
evolved stars.

As the hydrogen in the shell around the core is consumed, the helium core
grows. Eventually, the electrons in the helium core of stars less than
about 2.5 M☉ become degenerate, preventing the helium core from contracting
further.¹⁵ Later in the red giant phase, the cores of stars more massive
than 0.5 M☉ get hot enough to start helium fusion by the triple-alpha
process. In stars of approximately one solar mass, it can take a billion
years or more for the core to reach helium ignition temperatures.¹⁶

If the core is largely supported by electron degeneracy pressure, helium
fusion will ignite on a timescale of days in a helium flash. In more
massive stars, the ignition of helium fusion occurs relatively slowly with
no flash.¹⁷ The nuclear power released during the helium flash is very
large, on the order of 10⁸ times the luminosity of the Sun for a few days¹⁵
and 10¹¹ times the luminosity of the Sun (roughly the luminosity of the
Milky Way Galaxy) for a few seconds.¹⁸ However, the energy is absorbed by
the stellar envelope and thus cannot be seen from outside the star.¹⁵ ¹⁸
The energy released by helium fusion causes the core to expand, so that
hydrogen fusion in the overlying layers slows and total energy generation
decreases. The star contracts, although not all the way to the main
sequence, and it migrates to the horizontal branch on the
Hertzsprung–Russell diagram, gradually shrinking in radius and increasing
its surface temperature. Core helium flash stars evolve to the red end of
the horizontal branch but do not migrate to higher temperatures before they
gain a degenerate carbon-oxygen core and start helium shell burning. These
stars are often observed as a red clump of stars in the colour-magnitude
diagram of a cluster, hotter and less luminous than the red giants.
Higher-mass stars with larger helium cores move along the horizontal branch
to higher temperatures, some becoming unstable pulsating stars in the
yellow instability strip (RR Lyrae variables), whereas some become even
hotter and can form a blue tail or blue hook to the horizontal branch. The
exact morphology of the horizontal branch depends on parameters such as
metallicity, age, and helium content, but the exact details are still being
modelled.¹⁹

Asymptotic-giant-branch phase

After a star has consumed the helium at the core, hydrogen and helium
fusion continues in shells around a hot core of carbon and oxygen. The star
follows the asymptotic giant branch on the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram,
paralleling the original red giant evolution, but with even faster energy
generation (which lasts for a shorter time).²⁰ Although helium is being
burnt in a shell, the majority of the energy is produced by hydrogen
burning in a shell further from the core of the star. Helium from these
hydrogen burning shells drops towards the center of the star and
periodically the energy output from the helium shell increases
dramatically. This is known as a thermal pulse and they occur towards the
end of the asymptotic-giant-branch phase, sometimes even into the
post-asymptotic-giant-branch phase. Depending on mass and composition,
there may be several to hundreds of thermal pulses.

There is a phase on the ascent of the asymptotic-giant-branch where a deep
convective zone forms and can bring carbon from the core to the surface.
This is known as the second dredge up, and in some stars there may even be
a third dredge up. In this way a carbon star is formed, very cool and
strongly reddened stars showing strong carbon lines in their spectra. A
process known as hot bottom burning may convert carbon into oxygen and
nitrogen before it can be dredged to the surface, and the interaction
between these processes determines the observed luminosities and spectra of
carbon stars in particular clusters.²¹

Another well known class of asymptotic-giant-branch stars are the Mira
variables, which pulsate with well-defined periods of tens to hundreds of
days and large amplitudes up to about 10 magnitudes (in the visual, total
luminosity changes by a much smaller amount). In more-massive stars the
stars become more luminous and the pulsation period is longer, leading to
enhanced mass loss, and the stars become heavily obscured at visual
wavelengths. These stars can be observed as OH/IR stars, pulsating in the
infra-red and showing OH maser activity. These stars are clearly oxygen
rich, in contrast to the carbon stars, but both must be produced by dredge
ups.

These mid-range stars ultimately reach the tip of the
asymptotic-giant-branch and run out of fuel for shell burning. They are not
sufficiently massive to start full-scale carbon fusion, so they contract
again, going through a period of post-asymptotic-giant-branch superwind to
produce a planetary nebula with an extremely hot central star. The central
star then cools to a white dwarf. The expelled gas is relatively rich in
heavy elements created within the star and may be particularly oxygen or
carbon enriched, depending on the type of the star. The gas builds up in an
expanding shell called a circumstellar envelope and cools as it moves away
from the star, allowing dust particles and molecules to form. With the high
infrared energy input from the central star, ideal conditions are formed in
these circumstellar envelopes for maser excitation.

It is possible for thermal pulses to be produced once
post-asymptotic-giant-branch evolution has begun, producing a variety of
unusual and poorly understood stars known as born-again
asymptotic-giant-branch stars.²² These may result in extreme
horizontal-branch stars (subdwarf B stars), hydrogen deficient
post-asymptotic-giant-branch stars, variable planetary nebula central
stars, and R Coronae Borealis variables.

Massive stars

In massive stars, the core is already large enough at the onset of the
hydrogen burning shell that helium ignition will occur before electron
degeneracy pressure has a chance to become prevalent. Thus, when these
stars expand and cool, they do not brighten as much as lower-mass stars;
however, they were much brighter than lower-mass stars to begin with, and
are thus still brighter than the red giants formed from less-massive stars.
These stars are unlikely to survive as red supergiants; instead they will
destroy themselves as type II supernovas.

Extremely massive stars (more than approximately 40 M☉), which are very
luminous and thus have very rapid stellar winds, lose mass so rapidly due
to radiation pressure that they tend to strip off their own envelopes
before they can expand to become red supergiants, and thus retain extremely
high surface temperatures (and blue-white color) from their main-sequence
time onwards. The largest stars of the current generation are about 100-150
M☉ because the outer layers would be expelled by the extreme radiation.
Although lower-mass stars normally do not burn off their outer layers so
rapidly, they can likewise avoid becoming red giants or red supergiants if
they are in binary systems close enough so that the companion star strips
off the envelope as it expands, or if they rotate rapidly enough so that
convection extends all the way from the core to the surface, resulting in
the absence of a separate core and envelope due to thorough mixing.²³

The core grows hotter and denser as it gains material from fusion of
hydrogen at the base of the envelope. In all massive stars, electron
degeneracy pressure is insufficient to halt collapse by itself, so as each
major element is consumed in the center, progressively heavier elements
ignite, temporarily halting collapse. If the core of the star is not too
massive (less than approximately 1.4 M☉, taking into account mass loss that
has occurred by this time), it may then form a white dwarf (possibly
surrounded by a planetary nebula) as described above for less-massive
stars, with the difference that the white dwarf is composed chiefly of
oxygen, neon, and magnesium.

Above a certain mass (estimated at approximately 2.5 M☉ and whose star's
progenitor was around 10 M☉), the core will reach the temperature
(approximately 1.1 gigakelvins) at which neon partially breaks down to form
oxygen and helium, the latter of which immediately fuses with some of the
remaining neon to form magnesium; then oxygen fuses to form sulfur,
silicon, and smaller amounts of other elements. Finally, the temperature
gets high enough that any nucleus can be partially broken down, most
commonly releasing an alpha particle (helium nucleus) which immediately
fuses with another nucleus, so that several nuclei are effectively
rearranged into a smaller number of heavier nuclei, with net release of
energy because the addition of fragments to nuclei exceeds the energy
required to break them off the parent nuclei.

A star with a core mass too great to form a white dwarf but insufficient to
achieve sustained conversion of neon to oxygen and magnesium, will undergo
core collapse (due to electron capture) before achieving fusion of the
heavier elements.²⁴ Both heating and cooling caused by electron capture
onto minor constituent elements (such as aluminum and sodium) prior to
collapse may have a significant impact on total energy generation within
the star shortly before collapse.²⁵ This may produce a noticeable effect on
the abundance of elements and isotopes ejected in the subsequent supernova.

Supernova

Main article: Supernova

Once the nucleosynthesis process arrives at iron-56, the continuation of
this process consumes energy (the addition of fragments to nuclei releases
less energy than required to break them off the parent nuclei). If the mass
of the core exceeds the Chandrasekhar limit, electron degeneracy pressure
will be unable to support its weight against the force of gravity, and the
core will undergo sudden, catastrophic collapse to form a neutron star or
(in the case of cores that exceed the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff limit), a
black hole. Through a process that is not completely understood, some of
the gravitational potential energy released by this core collapse is
converted into a Type Ib, Type Ic, or Type II supernova. It is known that
the core collapse produces a massive surge of neutrinos, as observed with
supernova SN 1987A. The extremely energetic neutrinos fragment some nuclei;
some of their energy is consumed in releasing nucleons, including neutrons,
and some of their energy is transformed into heat and kinetic energy, thus
augmenting the shock wave started by rebound of some of the infalling
material from the collapse of the core. Electron capture in very dense
parts of the infalling matter may produce additional neutrons. Because some
of the rebounding matter is bombarded by the neutrons, some of its nuclei
capture them, creating a spectrum of heavier-than-iron material including
the radioactive elements up to (and likely beyond) uranium.²⁶ Although
non-exploding red giants can produce significant quantities of elements
heavier than iron using neutrons released in side reactions of earlier
nuclear reactions, the abundance of elements heavier than iron (and in
particular, of certain isotopes of elements that have multiple stable or
long-lived isotopes) produced in such reactions is quite different from
that produced in a supernova. Neither abundance alone matches that found in
the Solar System, so both supernovae and ejection of elements from red
giants are required to explain the observed abundance of heavy elements and
isotopes thereof.

The energy transferred from collapse of the core to rebounding material not
only generates heavy elements, but provides for their acceleration well
beyond escape velocity, thus causing a Type Ib, Type Ic, or Type II
supernova. Note that current understanding of this energy transfer is still
not satisfactory; although current computer models of Type Ib, Type Ic, and
Type II supernovae account for part of the energy transfer, they are not
able to account for enough energy transfer to produce the observed ejection
of material.²⁷

Some evidence gained from analysis of the mass and orbital parameters of
binary neutron stars (which require two such supernovae) hints that the
collapse of an oxygen-neon-magnesium core may produce a supernova that
differs observably (in ways other than size) from a supernova produced by
the collapse of an iron core.²⁸

The most-massive stars that exist today may be completely destroyed by a
supernova with an energy greatly exceeding its gravitational binding
energy. This rare event, caused by pair-instability, leaves behind no black
hole remnant.²⁹ In the past history of the universe, some stars were even
larger than the largest that exists today, and they would immediately
collapse into a black hole at the end of their lives, due to
photodisintegration.

Stellar remnants

After a star has burned out its fuel supply, its remnants can take one of
three forms, depending on the mass during its lifetime.

White and black dwarfs

Main articles: White dwarf and Black dwarf

For a star of 1 M☉, the resulting white dwarf is of about 0.6 M☉,
compressed into approximately the volume of the Earth. White dwarfs are
stable because the inward pull of gravity is balanced by the degeneracy
pressure of the star's electrons, a consequence of the Pauli exclusion
principle. Electron degeneracy pressure provides a rather soft limit
against further compression; therefore, for a given chemical composition,
white dwarfs of higher mass have a smaller volume. With no fuel left to
burn, the star radiates its remaining heat into space for billions of
years.

A white dwarf is very hot when it first forms, more than 100,000 K at the
surface and even hotter in its interior. It is so hot that a lot of its
energy is lost in the form of neutrinos for the first 10 million years of
its existence, but will have lost most of its energy after a billion
years.³⁰

The chemical composition of the white dwarf depends upon its mass. A star
of a few solar masses will ignite carbon fusion to form magnesium, neon,
and smaller amounts of other elements, resulting in a white dwarf composed
chiefly of oxygen, neon, and magnesium, provided that it can lose enough
mass to get below the Chandrasekhar limit (see below), and provided that
the ignition of carbon is not so violent as to blow the star apart in a
supernova.³¹ A star of mass on the order of magnitude of the Sun will be
unable to ignite carbon fusion, and will produce a white dwarf composed
chiefly of carbon and oxygen, and of mass too low to collapse unless matter
is added to it later (see below). A star of less than about half the mass
of the Sun will be unable to ignite helium fusion (as noted earlier), and
will produce a white dwarf composed chiefly of helium.

In the end, all that remains is a cold dark mass sometimes called a black
dwarf. However, the universe is not old enough for any black dwarfs to
exist yet.

If the white dwarf's mass increases above the Chandrasekhar limit, which is
1.4 M☉ for a white dwarf composed chiefly of carbon, oxygen, neon, and/or
magnesium, then electron degeneracy pressure fails due to electron capture
and the star collapses. Depending upon the chemical composition and
pre-collapse temperature in the center, this will lead either to collapse
into a neutron star or runaway ignition of carbon and oxygen. Heavier
elements favor continued core collapse, because they require a higher
temperature to ignite, because electron capture onto these elements and
their fusion products is easier; higher core temperatures favor runaway
nuclear reaction, which halts core collapse and leads to a Type Ia
supernova.³² These supernovae may be many times brighter than the Type II
supernova marking the death of a massive star, even though the latter has
the greater total energy release. This inability to collapse means that no
white dwarf more massive than approximately 1.4 M☉ can exist (with a
possible minor exception for very rapidly spinning white dwarfs, whose
centrifugal force due to rotation partially counteracts the weight of their
matter). Mass transfer in a binary system may cause an initially stable
white dwarf to surpass the Chandrasekhar limit.

If a white dwarf forms a close binary system with another star, hydrogen
from the larger companion may accrete around and onto a white dwarf until
it gets hot enough to fuse in a runaway reaction at its surface, although
the white dwarf remains below the Chandrasekhar limit. Such an explosion is
termed a nova.

Neutron stars

Main article: Neutron star

When a stellar core collapses, the pressure causes electron capture, thus
converting the great majority of the protons into neutrons. The
electromagnetic forces keeping separate nuclei apart are gone
(proportionally, if nuclei were the size of dust mites, atoms would be as
large as football stadiums), and most of the core of the star becomes a
dense ball of contiguous neutrons (in some ways like a giant atomic
nucleus), with a thin overlying layer of degenerate matter (chiefly iron
unless matter of different composition is added later). The neutrons resist
further compression by the Pauli Exclusion Principle, in a way analogous to
electron degeneracy pressure, but stronger.

These stars, known as neutron stars, are extremely small—on the order of
radius 10 km, no bigger than the size of a large city—and are phenomenally
dense. Their period of rotation shortens dramatically as the stars shrink
(due to conservation of angular momentum); observed rotational periods of
neutron stars range from about 1.5 milliseconds (over 600 revolutions per
second) to several seconds.³³ When these rapidly rotating stars' magnetic
poles are aligned with the Earth, we detect a pulse of radiation each
revolution. Such neutron stars are called pulsars, and were the first
neutron stars to be discovered. Though electromagnetic radiation detected
from pulsars is most often in the form of radio waves, pulsars have also
been detected at visible, X-ray, and gamma ray wavelengths.³⁴

Black holes

Main article: Black hole

If the mass of the stellar remnant is high enough, the neutron degeneracy
pressure will be insufficient to prevent collapse below the Schwarzschild
radius. The stellar remnant thus becomes a black hole. The mass at which
this occurs is not known with certainty, but is currently estimated at
between 2 and 3 M☉.

Black holes are predicted by the theory of general relativity. According to
classical general relativity, no matter or information can flow from the
interior of a black hole to an outside observer, although quantum effects
may allow deviations from this strict rule. The existence of black holes in
the universe is well supported, both theoretically and by astronomical
observation.

Because the core-collapse supernova mechanism itself is imperfectly
understood, it is still not known whether it is possible for a star to
collapse directly to a black hole without producing a visible supernova, or
whether some supernovae initially form unstable neutron stars which then
collapse into black holes; the exact relation between the initial mass of
the star and the final remnant is also not completely certain. Resolution
of these uncertainties requires the analysis of more supernovae and
supernova remnants.

Models

A stellar evolutionary model is a mathematical model that can be used to
compute the evolutionary phases of a star from its formation until it
becomes a remnant. The mass and chemical composition of the star are used
as the inputs, and the luminosity and surface temperature are the only
constraints. The model formulae are based upon the physical understanding
of the star, usually under the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium.
Extensive computer calculations are then run to determine the changing
state of the star over time, yielding a table of data that can be used to
determine the evolutionary track of the star across the Hertzsprung–Russell
diagram, along with other evolving properties.³⁵ Accurate models can be
used to estimate the current age of a star by comparing its physical
properties with those of stars along a matching evolutionary track.³⁶

Stellar nucleosynthesis

Stellar nucleosynthesis is the process by which the natural abundances of
the chemical elements within stars vary due to nuclear fusion reactions in
the cores and overlying mantles of stars. Stars are said to evolve (age)
with changes in the abundances of the elements within. Core fusion
increases the atomic weight of its gaseous elements, causing pressure loss
and contraction accompanied by increase of temperature.¹ Structural changes
of the star (evolution) become necessary to stabilize it. Stars lose most
of their mass when it is ejected late in their stellar lifetimes, thereby
increasing the abundance of elements heavier than helium in the
interstellar medium. The term supernova nucleosynthesis is used to describe
the creation of elements during the evolution and explosion of a
presupernova star, as Fred Hoyle advocated presciently in 1954.² One
stimulus to the development of the theory of nucleosynthesis was the
variations in the abundances of elements found in the universe. Those
abundances, when plotted on a graph as a function of atomic number of the
element, have a jagged sawtooth shape that varies by factors of tens of
millions. This suggested a natural process other than a random
distribution. Such a graph of the abundances can be seen at History of
nucleosynthesis theory. Stellar nucleosynthesis is the dominating
contributor to several processes that also occur under the collective term
nucleosynthesis.

A second stimulus to understanding the processes of stellar nucleosynthesis
occurred during the 20th century, when it was realized that the energy
released from nuclear fusion reactions accounted for the longevity of the
Sun as a source³ of heat and light. The fusion of nuclei in a star,
starting from its initial hydrogen and helium abundance, provides that
energy and synthesizes new nuclei as a byproduct of that fusion process.
This became clear during the decade prior to World War II. The fusion
product nuclei are restricted to those only slightly heavier than the
fusing nuclei; thus they do not contribute heavily to the natural
abundances of the elements. Nonetheless, this insight raised the
plausibility of explaining all of the natural abundances of elements in
this way. The prime energy producer in the sun is the fusion of hydrogen to
form helium, which occurs at a solar-core temperature of 14 million kelvin.

History

In 1920, Arthur Eddington, on the basis of the precise measurements of
atomic masses by F.W. Aston and a preliminary suggestion by Jean Perrin,
proposed that stars obtained their energy from nuclear fusion of hydrogen
to form helium and raised the possibility that the heavier elements are
produced in stars.⁴ ⁵ ⁶ This was a preliminary step toward the idea of
nucleosynthesis. In 1928, George Gamow derived what is now called the Gamow
factor, a quantum-mechanical formula that gave the probability of bringing
two nuclei sufficiently close for the strong nuclear force to overcome the
Coulomb barrier. The Gamow factor was used in the decade that followed by
Atkinson and Houtermans and later by Gamow himself and Edward Teller to
derive the rate at which nuclear reactions would proceed at the high
temperatures believed to exist in stellar interiors.

In 1939, in a paper entitled "Energy Production in Stars", Hans Bethe
analyzed the different possibilities for reactions by which hydrogen is
fused into helium.⁷ He defined two processes that he believed to be the
sources of energy in stars. The first one, the proton–proton chain
reaction, is the dominant energy source in stars with masses up to about
the mass of the Sun. The second process, the carbon-nitrogen-oxygen cycle,
which was also considered by Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker in 1938, is most
important in more massive stars. These works concerned the energy
generation capable of keeping stars hot. A clear physical description of
the p-p chain and of the CNO cycle appears in a 1968 textbook.⁸ Bethe's two
papers did not address the creation of heavier nuclei, however. That theory
was begun by Fred Hoyle in 1946 with his argument that a collection of very
hot nuclei would assemble into iron.⁹ Hoyle followed that in 1954 with a
large paper describing how advanced fusion stages within stars would
synthesize elements between carbon and iron in mass.¹⁰ This is the dominant
work in stellar nucleosynthesis.¹¹ It provided the roadmap to how the most
abundant elements on earth had been synthesized from initial hydrogen and
helium, making clear how those abundant elements increased their galactic
abundances as the galaxy aged.

Quickly, Hoyle's theory was expanded to other processes, beginning with the
publication of a celebrated review paper in 1957 by Burbidge, Burbidge,
Fowler and Hoyle (commonly referred to as the B²FH paper).¹² This review
paper collected and refined earlier research into a heavily cited picture
that gave promise of accounting for the observed relative abundances of the
elements; but it did not itself enlarge Hoyle's 1954 picture for the origin
of primary nuclei as much as many assumed, except in the understanding of
nucleosynthesis of those elements heavier than iron. Significant
improvements were made by Alastair GW Cameron and by Donald D. Clayton.
Cameron presented his own independent approach¹³ (following Hoyle's
approach for the most part) of nucleosynthesis. He introduced computers
into time-dependent calculations of evolution of nuclear systems. Clayton
calculated the first time-dependent models of the S-process¹⁴ and of the
R-process,¹⁵ as well as of the burning of silicon into the abundant
alpha-particle nuclei and iron-group elements,¹⁶ and discovered radiogenic
chronologies¹⁷ for determining the age of the elements. The entire research
field expanded rapidly in the 1970s.

Hydrogen burning

Illustration of the proton–proton chain reaction sequence
Overview of the CNO-I cycle. The helium nucleus is released at the top-left
step.

"Hydrogen burning" is an expression that astronomers sometimes use for the
stellar process that results in the nuclear fusion of four protons to form
a nucleus of helium-4.¹⁸ (This should not be confused with the chemical
combustion of hydrogen in an oxidizing atmosphere.) There are two
predominant processes by which stellar hydrogen burning occurs.

In the cores of lower mass main sequence stars such as the Sun, the
dominant process is the proton-proton chain reaction (pp-chain reaction).
This creates a helium-4 nucleus through a sequence of chain reactions that
begin with the fusion of two protons to form a nucleus of deuterium.¹⁹ The
subsequent process of deuterium burning will consume any pre-existing
deuterium found at the core. The pp-chain reaction cycle is relatively
insensitive to temperature, so this hydrogen burning process can occur in
up to a third of the star's radius and occupy half the star's mass. As a
result, for stars above 35% of the Sun's mass,²⁰ the energy flux toward the
surface is sufficiently low that the core region remains a radiative zone,
rather than becoming convective.²¹ In each complete fusion cycle, the p-p
chain reaction releases about 26.2 MeV.¹⁹

In higher mass stars, the dominant process is the CNO cycle, which is a
catalytic cycle that uses nuclei of carbon, nitrogen and oxygen as
intermediaries to produce a helium nucleus.¹⁹ During a complete CNO cycle,
25.0 MeV of energy is released. The difference in energy compared to the
p-p chain reaction is accounted for by the energy lost through neutrino
emission.¹⁹ The CNO cycle is very temperature sensitive, so it is strongly
concentrated at the core. About 90% of the CNO cycle energy generation
occurs within the inner 15% of the star's mass.²² This results in an
intense outward energy flux that can not be sustained by radiative
transfer. As a result, the core region becomes a convection zone, which
stirs the hydrogen burning region and keeps it well mixed with the
surrounding proton-rich region.²³ This core convection occurs in stars
where the CNO cycle contributes more than 20% of the total energy. As the
star ages and the core temperature increases, the region occupied by the
convection zone slowly shrinks from 20% of the mass down to the inner 8% of
the mass.²²

The type of hydrogen burning process that dominates inside a star is
determined by the temperature dependency differences between the two
reactions. The pp-chain reaction starts at temperatures around 4×10⁶ K,²⁴
making it the dominant mechanism in smaller stars. A self-maintaining CNO
chain requires a higher temperature of approximately 15×10⁶ K, but
thereafter it increases more rapidly in efficiency than the pp-chain
reaction as the temperature grows.²⁵ Above approximately 17×10⁶ K, the CNO
cycle becomes the dominant source of energy. This temperature is achieved
in the cores of main sequence stars with at least 1.3 times the mass of the
Sun.²⁶ The Sun itself has a core temperature of around 15.7×10⁶ K and only
0.8% of the energy being produced in the Sun comes from the CNO cycle.²⁷ As
a main sequence star ages, the core temperature will rise, resulting in a
steadily increasing contribution from its CNO cycle.²²

Once a star with about 0.5–10 times the mass of the Sun has consumed nearly
all the hydrogen at its core, it begins to evolve up the red giant branch.
Hydrogen burning occurs in a shell surrounding an inert helium core until
the steadily increasing core temperature exceeds 1×10⁸ K. At that point
helium burning begins with a thermal runaway process called the helium
flash with hydrogen burning continuing in a thin shell surrounding the now
active helium core.²¹

Sun

This article is about the star. For other uses, see Sun (disambiguation).

The Sun (in Greek: Helios, in Latin: Sol[lower-alpha 1]) is the star at the
center of the Solar System and is by far the most important source of
energy for life on Earth. It is a nearly perfect spherical ball of hot
plasma,¹² ¹³ with internal convective motion that generates a magnetic
field via a dynamo process.¹⁴ Its diameter is about 109 times that of
Earth, and it has a mass about 330,000 times that of Earth, accounting for
about 99.86% of the total mass of the Solar System.¹⁵ About three quarters
of the Sun's mass consists of hydrogen; the rest is mostly helium, with
much smaller quantities of heavier elements, including oxygen, carbon, neon
and iron.¹⁶

The Sun is a G-type main-sequence star (G2V) based on spectral class and it
is informally referred to as a yellow dwarf. It formed approximately 4.567
billion[lower-alpha 2]¹⁷ years ago from the gravitational collapse of
matter within a region of a large molecular cloud. Most of this matter
gathered in the center, whereas the rest flattened into an orbiting disk
that became the Solar System. The central mass became increasingly hot and
dense, eventually initiating nuclear fusion in its core. It is thought that
almost all stars form by this process.

The Sun is roughly middle aged and has not changed dramatically for four
billion[lower-alpha 2] years, and will remain fairly stable for another
four billion years. However, after hydrogen fusion in its core has stopped,
the Sun will undergo severe changes and become a red giant. It is
calculated that the Sun will become sufficiently large to engulf the
current orbits of Mercury, Venus, and possibly Earth.

The enormous effect of the Sun on the Earth has been recognized since
prehistoric times, and the Sun has been regarded by some cultures as a
deity. Earth's movement around the Sun is the basis of the solar calendar,
which is the predominant calendar in use today.

Name and etymology

The English proper noun Sun developed from Old English sunne and may be
related to south. Cognates to English sun appear in other Germanic
languages, including Old Frisian sunne, sonne, Old Saxon sunna, Middle
Dutch sonne, modern Dutch zon, Old High German sunna, modern German Sonne,
Old Norse sunna, and Gothic sunnō. All Germanic terms for the Sun stem from
Proto-Germanic *sunnōn.¹⁸ ¹⁹

The English weekday name Sunday stems from Old English (Sunnandæg; "Sun's
day", from before 700) and is ultimately a result of a Germanic
interpretation of Latin dies solis, itself a translation of the Greek ἡμέρα
ἡλίου (hēméra hēlíou).²⁰ The Latin name for the Sun, Sol, is widely known
but is not common in general English language use; the adjectival form is
the related word solar.²¹ ²² The term sol is also used by planetary
astronomers to refer to the duration of a solar day on another planet, such
as Mars.²³ A mean Earth solar day is approximately 24 hours, whereas a mean
Martian 'sol' is 24 hours, 39 minutes, and 35.244 seconds.²⁴

Religious aspects

The Sun is viewed as a goddess in Germanic paganism, Sól/Sunna.¹⁹ Scholars
theorize that the Sun, as a Germanic goddess, may represent an extension of
an earlier Proto-Indo-European Sun deity because of Indo-European
linguistic connections between Old Norse Sól, Sanskrit Surya, Gaulish
Sulis, Lithuanian Saulė, and Slavic Solntse.¹⁹

In ancient Roman culture, Sunday was the day of the Sun god. It was adopted
as the Sabbath day by Christians who did not have a Jewish background. The
symbol of light was a pagan device adopted by Christians – perhaps the most
important one that did not come from Jewish traditions. In paganism, the
sun was a source of life, giving warmth and illumination to mankind. It was
the center of a popular cult among Romans, who would stand at dawn to catch
the first rays of sunshine as they prayed. The celebration of the winter
solstice (which influenced Christmas) was part of the Roman cult of the
sun. Christian churches were built with an orientation so that the
congregation faced toward the sunrise in the East.²⁵

Characteristics

The Sun is a G-type main-sequence star that comprises about 99.86% of the
mass of the Solar System. The Sun has an absolute magnitude of +4.83,
estimated to be brighter than about 85% of the stars in the Milky Way, most
of which are red dwarfs.²⁶ ²⁷ The Sun is a Population I, or
heavy-element-rich,[lower-alpha 3] star.²⁸ The formation of the Sun may
have been triggered by shockwaves from one or more nearby supernovae.²⁹
This is suggested by a high abundance of heavy elements in the Solar
System, such as gold and uranium, relative to the abundances of these
elements in so-called Population II, heavy-element-poor, stars. These
elements could most plausibly have been produced by endothermic nuclear
reactions during a supernova, or by transmutation through neutron
absorption within a massive second-generation star.²⁸

The Sun is by far the brightest object in the sky, with an apparent
magnitude of −26.74.³⁰ ³¹ This is about 13 billion times brighter than the
next brightest star, Sirius, which has an apparent magnitude of −1.46. The
mean distance of the Sun to Earth is approximately 1 astronomical unit
(about 150,000,000 km; 93,000,000 mi), though the distance varies as Earth
moves from perihelion in January to aphelion in July.³² At this average
distance, light travels from the Sun to Earth in about 8 minutes and 19
seconds. The energy of this sunlight supports almost all life[lower-alpha
4] on Earth by photosynthesis,³³ and drives Earth's climate and weather.

The Sun does not have a definite boundary, and in its outer parts its
density decreases exponentially with increasing distance from its center.³⁴
For the purpose of measurement, however, the Sun's radius is considered to
be the distance from its center to the edge of the photosphere, the
apparent visible surface of the Sun.³⁵ By this measure, the Sun is a
near-perfect sphere with an oblateness estimated at about 9 millionths,³⁶
which means that its polar diameter differs from its equatorial diameter by
only 10 kilometres (6.2 mi).³⁷ The tidal effect of the planets is weak and
does not significantly affect the shape of the Sun.³⁸ The Sun rotates
faster at its equator than at its poles. This differential rotation is
caused by convective motion due to heat transport and the Coriolis force
due to the Sun's rotation. In a frame of reference defined by the stars,
the rotational period is approximately 25.6 days at the equator and 33.5
days at the poles. Viewed from Earth as it orbits the Sun, the apparent
rotational period of the Sun at its equator is about 28 days.³⁹

Sunlight

Main article: Sunlight

Sunlight is Earth's primary source of energy. The other significant source
of Earth's energy is the store of fissionable materials generated by the
cataclysmic death of other stars. These fissionable materials trapped in
Earth's crust give rise to geothermal energy, which drives the volcanism on
Earth and also makes it possible for humans to fuel nuclear reactors. The
solar constant is the amount of power that the Sun deposits per unit area
that is directly exposed to sunlight. The solar constant is equal to
approximately 1,368 W/m² (watts per square meter) at a distance of one
astronomical unit (AU) from the Sun (that is, on or near Earth).⁴⁰ Sunlight
on the surface of Earth is attenuated by Earth's atmosphere so that less
power arrives at the surface—closer to 1,000 W/m² in clear conditions when
the Sun is near the zenith.⁴¹ Sunlight at the top of Earth's atmosphere is
composed (by total energy) of about 50% infrared light, 40% visible light,
and 10% ultraviolet light.⁴² The atmosphere in particular filters out over
70% of solar ultraviolet, especially at the shorter wavelengths.⁴³ Solar
ultraviolet radiation ionizes the Earth's dayside upper atmosphere,
creating the electrically conducting ionosphere.⁴⁴

The Sun's color is white, with a CIE color-space index near (0.3, 0.3),
when viewed from space or when high in the sky; when low in the sky,
atmospheric scattering renders the Sun yellow, red, orange, or magenta.
Despite its typical whiteness, most people mentally picture the Sun as
yellow; the reasons for this are the subject of debate.⁴⁵ The Sun is a G2V
star, with G2 indicating its surface temperature of approximately 5,778 K
(5,505 °C, 9,941 °F), and V that it, like most stars, is a main-sequence
star.⁴⁶ ⁴⁷ The luminance of the Sun is about 1.88 giga candela per square
metre, but as viewed through Earth's atmosphere, this is lowered to about
1.44 Gcd/m².⁴⁸

Composition

See also: Molecules in stars

The Sun is composed primarily of the chemical elements hydrogen and helium;
they account for 74.9% and 23.8% of the mass of the Sun in the photosphere,
respectively.⁴⁹ All heavier elements, called metals in astronomy, account
for less than 2% of the mass, with oxygen (roughly 1% of the Sun's mass),
carbon (0.3%), neon (0.2%), and iron (0.2%) being the most abundant.⁵⁰

The Sun inherited its chemical composition from the interstellar medium out
of which it formed. The hydrogen and helium in the Sun were produced by Big
Bang nucleosynthesis, and the heavier elements were produced by stellar
nucleosynthesis in generations of stars that completed their stellar
evolution and returned their material to the interstellar medium before the
formation of the Sun.⁵¹ The chemical composition of the photosphere is
normally considered representative of the composition of the primordial
Solar System.⁵² However, since the Sun formed, some of the helium and heavy
elements have gravitationally settled from the photosphere. Therefore, in
today's photosphere the helium fraction is reduced and the metallicity is
only 84% of that in the protostellar phase (before nuclear fusion in the
core started). The protostellar Sun's composition was reconstructed as
71.1% hydrogen, 27.4% helium, and 1.5% heavier elements.⁴⁹

In the inner portions of the Sun, nuclear fusion has modified the
composition by converting hydrogen into helium, so the innermost portion of
the Sun is now roughly 60% helium, with the abundance of heavier elements
unchanged. Because the interior of the Sun is radiative, not convective
(see Radiative zone below), none of the fusion products from the core have
risen to the photosphere.⁵³

The reactive core zone of "hydrogen burning", where hydrogen is converted
into helium, is starting to surround the core of "helium ash". This
development will continue and will eventually cause the Sun to leave the
main sequence, to become a red giant.⁵⁴

The solar heavy-element abundances described above are typically measured
both using spectroscopy of the Sun's photosphere and by measuring
abundances in meteorites that have never been heated to melting
temperatures. These meteorites are thought to retain the composition of the
protostellar Sun and are thus not affected by settling of heavy elements.
The two methods generally agree well.¹⁶

Singly ionized iron-group elements

In the 1970s, much research focused on the abundances of iron-group
elements in the Sun.⁵⁵ ⁵⁶ Although significant research was done, until
1978 it was difficult to determine the abundances of some iron-group
elements (e.g. cobalt and manganese) via spectrography because of their
hyperfine structures.⁵⁵

The first largely complete set of oscillator strengths of singly ionized
iron-group elements were made available in the 1960s,⁵⁷ and these were
subsequently improved.⁵⁸ In 1978, the abundances of singly ionized elements
of the iron group were derived.⁵⁵

Isotopic composition

Various authors have considered the existence of a gradient in the isotopic
compositions of solar and planetary noble gases,⁵⁹ e.g. correlations
between isotopic compositions of neon and xenon in the Sun and on the
planets.⁶⁰

Prior to 1983, it was thought that the whole Sun has the same composition
as the solar atmosphere.⁶¹ In 1983, it was claimed that it was
fractionation in the Sun itself that caused the isotopic-composition
relationship between the planetary and solar-wind-implanted noble gases.⁶¹

Structure

Core

Main article: Solar core

The core of the Sun extends from the center to about 20–25% of the solar
radius.⁶² It has a density of up to 150 g/cm³⁶³ ⁶⁴ (about 150 times the
density of water) and a temperature of close to 15.7 million kelvin (K).⁶⁴
By contrast, the Sun's surface temperature is approximately 5,800 K. Recent
analysis of SOHO mission data favors a faster rotation rate in the core
than in the rest of the radiative zone.⁶² Through most of the Sun's life,
energy is produced by nuclear fusion in the core region through a series of
steps called the p–p (proton–proton) chain; this process converts hydrogen
into helium.⁶⁵ Only 0.8% of the energy generated in the Sun comes from the
CNO cycle, though this proportion is expected to increase as the Sun gets
older.⁶⁶

The core is the only region in the Sun that produces an appreciable amount
of thermal energy through fusion; 99% of the power is generated within 24%
of the Sun's radius, and by 30% of the radius, fusion has stopped nearly
entirely. The rest of the Sun is heated by this energy that is transferred
outwards through many successive layers to the solar photosphere before it
escapes into space as sunlight or the kinetic energy of particles.⁴⁶ ⁶⁷

The proton–proton chain occurs around 9.2×10³⁷ times each second in the
core, converting about 3.7×10³⁸ protons into alpha particles (helium
nuclei) every second (out of a total of ~8.9×10⁵⁶ free protons in the Sun),
or about 6.2×10¹¹ kg/s.⁴⁶ Fusing four free protons (hydrogen nuclei) into a
single alpha particle (helium nuclei) releases around 0.7% of the fused
mass as energy,⁶⁸ so the Sun releases energy at the mass–energy conversion
rate of 4.26 million metric tons per second, for 384.6 yotta watts
(3.846×10²⁶ W),¹ or 9.192×10¹⁰ megatons of TNT per second. Theoretical
models of the Sun's interior indicate a power density of approximately
276.5 W/m³,⁶⁹ a value that more nearly approximates reptile metabolism than
a thermonuclear bomb.[lower-alpha 5] Peak power production in the Sun has
been compared to the volumetric heat generated in an active compost heap.
The tremendous power output of the Sun is not due to its high power per
volume, but instead due to its large size.

The fusion rate in the core is in a self-correcting equilibrium: a slightly
higher rate of fusion would cause the core to heat up more and expand
slightly against the weight of the outer layers, reducing the fusion rate
and correcting the perturbation; and a slightly lower rate would cause the
core to cool and shrink slightly, increasing the fusion rate and again
reverting it to its present level.⁷⁰ ⁷¹

Radiative zone

Main article: Radiative zone

From the core out to about 0.7 solar radii, thermal radiation is the
primary means of energy transfer.⁷² This zone is not regulated by thermal
convection. The temperature drops from approximately 7 million to 2 million
kelvin with increasing distance from the core.⁶⁴ This temperature gradient
is less than the value of the adiabatic lapse rate and hence cannot drive
convection.⁶⁴ Energy is transferred by radiation—ions of hydrogen and
helium emit photons, which travel only a brief distance before being
reabsorbed by other ions.⁷² The density drops a hundredfold (from 20 g/cm³
to only 0.2 g/cm³) from 0.25 solar radii to the top of the radiative
zone.⁷²

Tachocline

Main article: Tachocline

The radiative zone and the convective zone are separated by a transition
layer, the tachocline. This is a region where the sharp regime change
between the uniform rotation of the radiative zone and the differential
rotation of the convection zone results in a large shear—a condition where
successive horizontal layers slide past one another.⁷³ The fluid motions
found in the convection zone above, slowly disappear from the top of this
layer to its bottom, matching the calm characteristics of the radiative
zone on the bottom. Presently, it is hypothesized (see Solar dynamo) that a
magnetic dynamo within this layer generates the Sun's magnetic field.⁶⁴

Convective zone

Main article: Convection zone

In the Sun's outer layer, from its surface to approximately 200,000 km
below (70% of the solar radius from the center), the temperature is lower
than in the radiative zone and heavier atoms are not fully ionized. As a
result, radiative heat transport is less effective. The density of the
plasma is low enough to allow convective currents to develop. Material
heated at the tachocline picks up heat and expands, thereby reducing its
density and allowing it to rise. As a result, thermal convection develops
as thermal cells carry the majority of the heat outward to the Sun's
photosphere. Once the material diffusively and radiatively cools just
beneath the photospheric surface, its density increases, and it sinks to
the base of the convection zone, where it picks up more heat from the top
of the radiative zone and the convective cycle continues. At the
photosphere, the temperature has dropped to 5,700 K and the density to only
0.2 g/m³ (about 1/6,000th the density of air at sea level).⁶⁴

The thermal columns in the convection zone form an imprint on the surface
of the Sun as the solar granulation and supergranulation. The turbulent
convection of this outer part of the solar interior sustains "small-scale"
dynamo action over the near-surface volume of the Sun.⁶⁴ The Sun's thermal
columns are Bénard cells and take the shape of hexagonal prisms.⁷⁴

Photosphere

Main article: Photosphere

The visible surface of the Sun, the photosphere, is the layer below which
the Sun becomes opaque to visible light.⁷⁵ Above the photosphere visible
sunlight is free to propagate into space, and its energy escapes the Sun
entirely. The change in opacity is due to the decreasing amount of H− ions,
which absorb visible light easily.⁷⁵ Conversely, the visible light we see
is produced as electrons react with hydrogen atoms to produce H− ions.⁷⁶ ⁷⁷
The photosphere is tens to hundreds of kilometers thick, being slightly
less opaque than air on Earth. Because the upper part of the photosphere is
cooler than the lower part, an image of the Sun appears brighter in the
center than on the edge or limb of the solar disk, in a phenomenon known as
limb darkening.⁷⁵ The spectrum of sunlight has approximately the spectrum
of a black-body radiating at about 6,000 K, interspersed with atomic
absorption lines from the tenuous layers above the photosphere. The
photosphere has a particle density of ~10²³ m−3 (about 0.37% of the
particle number per volume of Earth's atmosphere at sea level). The
photosphere is not fully ionized—the extent of ionization is about 3%,
leaving almost all of the hydrogen in atomic form.⁷⁸

During early studies of the optical spectrum of the photosphere, some
absorption lines were found that did not correspond to any chemical
elements then known on Earth. In 1868, Norman Lockyer hypothesized that
these absorption lines were caused by a new element that he dubbed helium,
after the Greek Sun god Helios. Twenty-five years later, helium was
isolated on Earth.⁷⁹

Atmosphere

See also: Corona and Coronal loop

During a total solar eclipse, when the disk of the Sun is covered by that
of the Moon, the Sun's surrounding atmosphere can be seen. It is composed
of three distinct parts the chromosphere, the transition region, the
corona, that, together, form the heliosphere.⁷⁵

The coolest layer of the Sun is a temperature minimum region about 500 km
above the photosphere, with a temperature of about 4,100 K.⁷⁵ This part of
the Sun is cool enough to allow the existence of simple molecules such as
carbon monoxide and water, which can be detected via their absorption
spectra.⁸⁰

The chromosphere, transition region, and corona are much hotter than the
surface of the Sun.⁷⁵ The reason is not well understood, but evidence
suggests that Alfvén waves may have enough energy to heat the corona.⁸¹

Above the temperature minimum layer is a layer about 2,000 km thick,
dominated by a spectrum of emission and absorption lines.⁷⁵ It is called
the chromosphere from the Greek root chroma, meaning color, because the
chromosphere is visible as a colored flash at the beginning and end of
total solar eclipses.⁷² The temperature in the chromosphere increases
gradually with altitude, ranging up to around 20,000 K near the top.⁷⁵ In
the upper part of the chromosphere helium becomes partially ionized.⁸²

Above the chromosphere, in a thin (about 200 km) transition region, the
temperature rises rapidly from around 20,000 K in the upper chromosphere to
coronal temperatures closer to 1,000,000 K.⁸³ The temperature increase is
facilitated by the full ionization of helium in the transition region,
which significantly reduces radiative cooling of the plasma.⁸² The
transition region does not occur at a well-defined altitude. Rather, it
forms a kind of nimbus around chromospheric features such as spicules and
filaments, and is in constant, chaotic motion.⁷² The transition region is
not easily visible from Earth's surface, but is readily observable from
space by instruments sensitive to the extreme ultraviolet portion of the
spectrum.⁸⁴

The corona is the next layer of the Sun. The low corona, near the surface
of the Sun, has a particle density around 10¹⁵ m−3 to 10¹⁶ m−3.⁸²
[lower-alpha 6] The average temperature of the corona and solar wind is
about 1,000,000–2,000,000 K; however, in the hottest regions it is
8,000,000–20,000,000 K.⁸³ Although no complete theory yet exists to account
for the temperature of the corona, at least some of its heat is known to be
from magnetic reconnection.⁸³ ⁸⁵ The corona is the extended atmosphere of
the Sun, which has a volume much larger than the volume enclosed by the
Sun's photosphere. A flow of plasma outward from the Sun into
interplanetary space is the solar wind.⁸⁵

The heliosphere, the tenuous outermost atmosphere of the Sun, is filled
with the solar wind plasma. This outermost layer of the Sun is defined to
begin at the distance where the flow of the solar wind becomes
superalfvénic—that is, where the flow becomes faster than the speed of
Alfvén waves,⁸⁶ at approximately 20 solar radii (0.1 AU). Turbulence and
dynamic forces in the heliosphere cannot affect the shape of the solar
corona within, because the information can only travel at the speed of
Alfvén waves. The solar wind travels outward continuously through the
heliosphere,⁸⁷ ⁸⁸ forming the solar magnetic field into a spiral shape,⁸⁵
until it impacts the heliopause more than 50 AU from the Sun. In December
2004, the Voyager 1 probe passed through a shock front that is thought to
be part of the heliopause. Both of the Voyager probes have recorded higher
levels of energetic particles as they approach the boundary.⁸⁹

Photons and neutrinos

High-energy gamma-ray photons initially released with fusion reactions in
the core are almost immediately absorbed by the solar plasma of the
radiative zone, usually after traveling only a few millimeters. Re-emission
happens in a random direction and usually at a slightly lower energy. With
this sequence of emissions and absorptions, it takes a long time for
radiation to reach the Sun's surface. Estimates of the photon travel time
range between 10,000 and 170,000 years.⁹⁰ In contrast, it takes only 2.3
seconds for the neutrinos, which account for about 2% of the total energy
production of the Sun, to reach the surface. Because energy transport in
the Sun is a process that involves photons in thermodynamic equilibrium
with matter, the time scale of energy transport in the Sun is longer, on
the order of 30,000,000 years. This is the time it would take the Sun to
return to a stable state, if the rate of energy generation in its core were
suddenly changed.⁹¹

Neutrinos are also released by the fusion reactions in the core, but,
unlike photons, they rarely interact with matter, so almost all are able to
escape the Sun immediately. For many years measurements of the number of
neutrinos produced in the Sun were lower than theories predicted by a
factor of 3. This discrepancy was resolved in 2001 through the discovery of
the effects of neutrino oscillation: the Sun emits the number of neutrinos
predicted by the theory, but neutrino detectors were missing ²⁄₃ of them
because the neutrinos had changed flavor by the time they were detected.⁹²

Magnetism and activity

Magnetic field

See also: Stellar magnetic field, Sunspots and List of solar cycles
Butterfly diagram showing paired sunspot pattern. Graph is of sunspot area.

The Sun has a magnetic field that varies across the surface of the Sun. Its
polar field is 1–2 gauss (0.0001–0.0002 T), whereas the field is typically
3,000 gauss (0.3 T) in features on the Sun called sunspots and 10–100 gauss
(0.001–0.01 T) in solar prominences.¹

The magnetic field also varies in time and location. The quasi-periodic
11-year solar cycle is the most prominent variation in which the number and
size of sunspots waxes and wanes.¹⁴ ⁹⁴ ⁹⁵

Sunspots are visible as dark patches on the Sun's photosphere, and
correspond to concentrations of magnetic field where the convective
transport of heat is inhibited from the solar interior to the surface. As a
result, sunspots are slightly cooler than the surrounding photosphere, and,
so, they appear dark. At a typical solar minimum, few sunspots are visible,
and occasionally none can be seen at all. Those that do appear are at high
solar latitudes. As the solar cycle progresses towards its maximum,
sunspots tend form closer to the solar equator, a phenomenon known as
Spörer's law. The largest sunspots can be tens of thousands of kilometers
across.⁹⁶

An 11-year sunspot cycle is half of a 22-year Babcock–Leighton dynamo
cycle, which corresponds to an oscillatory exchange of energy between
toroidal and poloidal solar magnetic fields. At solar-cycle maximum, the
external poloidal dipolar magnetic field is near its dynamo-cycle minimum
strength, but an internal toroidal quadrupolar field, generated through
differential rotation within the tachocline, is near its maximum strength.
At this point in the dynamo cycle, buoyant upwelling within the convective
zone forces emergence of toroidal magnetic field through the photosphere,
giving rise to pairs of sunspots, roughly aligned east–west and having
footprints with opposite magnetic polarities. The magnetic polarity of
sunspot pairs alternates every solar cycle, a phenomenon known as the Hale
cycle.⁹⁷ ⁹⁸

During the solar cycle's declining phase, energy shifts from the internal
toroidal magnetic field to the external poloidal field, and sunspots
diminish in number. At solar-cycle minimum, the toroidal field is,
correspondingly, at minimum strength, sunspots are relatively rare, and the
poloidal field is at its maximum strength. With the rise of the next
11-year sunspot cycle, differential rotation shifts magnetic energy back
from the poloidal to the toroidal field, but with a polarity that is
opposite to the previous cycle. The process carries on continuously, and in
an idealized, simplified scenario, each 11-year sunspot cycle corresponds
to a change, then, in the overall polarity of the Sun's large-scale
magnetic field.⁹⁹ ¹⁰⁰

The solar magnetic field extends well beyond the Sun itself. The
electrically conducting solar wind plasma carries the Sun's magnetic field
into space, forming what is called the interplanetary magnetic field.⁸⁵ In
an approximation known as ideal magnetohydrodynamics, plasma particles only
move along the magnetic field lines. As a result, the outward-flowing solar
wind stretches the interplanetary magnetic field outward, forcing it into a
roughly radial structure. For a simple dipolar solar magnetic field, with
opposite hemispherical polarities on either side of the solar magnetic
equator, a thin current sheet is formed in the solar wind.⁸⁵ At great
distances, the rotation of the Sun twists the dipolar magnetic field and
corresponding current sheet into an Archimedean spiral structure called the
Parker spiral.⁸⁵ The interplanetary magnetic field is much stronger than
the dipole component of the solar magnetic field. The Sun's dipole magnetic
field of 50–400 μT (at the photosphere) reduces with the inverse-cube of
the distance to about 0.1 nT at the distance of Earth. However, according
to spacecraft observations the interplanetary field at Earth's location is
around 5 nT, about a hundred times greater.¹⁰¹ The difference is due to
magnetic fields generated by electrical currents in the plasma surrounding
the Sun.

Variation in activity

The Sun's magnetic field leads to many effects that are collectively called
solar activity. Solar flares and coronal-mass ejections tend to occur at
sunspot groups. Slowly changing high-speed streams of solar wind are
emitted from coronal holes at the photospheric surface. Both coronal-mass
ejections and high-speed streams of solar wind carry plasma and
interplanetary magnetic field outward into the Solar System.¹⁰² The effects
of solar activity on Earth include auroras at moderate to high latitudes
and the disruption of radio communications and electric power. Solar
activity is thought to have played a large role in the formation and
evolution of the Solar System.

With solar-cycle modulation of sunspot number comes a corresponding
modulation of space weather conditions, including those surrounding Earth
where technological systems can be affected.

Long-term change

Long-term secular change in sunspot number is thought, by some scientists,
to be correlated with long-term change in solar irradiance,¹⁰³ which, in
turn, might influence Earth's long-term climate.¹⁰⁴ For example, in the
17th century, the solar cycle appeared to have stopped entirely for several
decades; few sunspots were observed during a period known as the Maunder
minimum. This coincided in time with the era of the Little Ice Age, when
Europe experienced unusually cold temperatures.¹⁰⁵ Earlier extended minima
have been discovered through analysis of tree rings and appear to have
coincided with lower-than-average global temperatures.¹⁰⁶

A recent theory claims that there are magnetic instabilities in the core of
the Sun that cause fluctuations with periods of either 41,000 or 100,000
years. These could provide a better explanation of the ice ages than the
Milankovitch cycles.¹⁰⁷ ¹⁰⁸

Life phases

Main articles: Formation and evolution of the Solar System and Stellar
evolution

The Sun today is roughly halfway through the most stable part of its life.
It has not changed dramatically for four billion[lower-alpha 2] years, and
will remain fairly stable for four billion more. However, after hydrogen
fusion in its core has stopped, the Sun will undergo severe changes, both
internally and externally.

Formation

The Sun was formed about 4.57 billion years ago from the collapse of part
of a giant molecular cloud that consisted mostly of hydrogen and helium and
that probably gave birth to many other stars.¹⁰⁹ This age is estimated
using computer models of stellar evolution and through
nucleocosmochronology.⁸ The result is consistent with the radiometric date
of the oldest Solar System material, at 4.567 billion years ago.¹¹⁰ ¹¹¹
Studies of ancient meteorites reveal traces of stable daughter nuclei of
short-lived isotopes, such as iron-60, that form only in exploding,
short-lived stars. This indicates that one or more supernovae must have
occurred near the location where the Sun formed. A shock wave from a nearby
supernova would have triggered the formation of the Sun by compressing the
matter within the molecular cloud and causing certain regions to collapse
under their own gravity.¹¹² As one fragment of the cloud collapsed it also
began to rotate because of conservation of angular momentum and heat up
with the increasing pressure. Much of the mass became concentrated in the
center, whereas the rest flattened out into a disk that would become the
planets and other Solar System bodies. Gravity and pressure within the core
of the cloud generated a lot of heat as it accreted more matter from the
surrounding disk, eventually triggering nuclear fusion. Thus, the Sun was
born.

Main sequence

The Sun is about halfway through its main-sequence stage, during which
nuclear fusion reactions in its core fuse hydrogen into helium. Each
second, more than four million tonnes of matter are converted into energy
within the Sun's core, producing neutrinos and solar radiation. At this
rate, the Sun has so far converted around 100 times the mass of Earth into
energy, about 0.03% of the total mass of the Sun. The Sun will spend a
total of approximately 10 billion years as a main-sequence star.¹¹⁴ The Sun
is gradually becoming hotter during its time on the main sequence, because
the helium atoms in the core occupy less volume than the hydrogen atoms
that were fused. The core is therefore shrinking, allowing the outer layers
of the Sun to move closer to the centre and experience a stronger
gravitational force, according to the inverse-square law. This stronger
force increases the pressure on the core, which is resisted by a gradual
increase in the rate at which fusion occurs. This process speeds up as the
core gradually becomes denser. It is estimated that the Sun has become 30%
brighter in the last 4.5 billion years.¹¹⁵ At present, it is increasing in
brightness by about 1% every 100 million years.¹¹⁶

After core hydrogen exhaustion

The Sun does not have enough mass to explode as a supernova. Instead it
will exit the main sequence in approximately 5.4 billion years and start to
turn into a red giant. It is calculated that the Sun will become
sufficiently large to engulf the current orbits of the Solar System's inner
planets, possibly including Earth.¹¹⁷ ¹¹⁸

Even before it becomes a red giant, the luminosity of the Sun will have
nearly doubled, and Earth will be hotter than Venus is today. Once the core
hydrogen is exhausted in 5.4 billion years, the Sun will expand into a
subgiant phase and slowly double in size over about half a billion years.
It will then expand more rapidly over about half a billion years until it
is over two hundred times larger than today and a couple of thousand times
more luminous. This then starts the red-giant-branch (RGB) phase where the
Sun will spend around a billion years and lose around a third of its
mass.¹¹⁸

After RGB the Sun has approximately 120 million years of active life left,
but much happens. First, the core, full of degenerate helium ignites
violently in the helium flash, where it is estimated that 6% of the core,
itself 40% of the Sun's mass, will be converted into carbon within a matter
of minutes through the triple-alpha process.¹¹⁹ The Sun then shrinks to
around 10 times its current size and 50 times the luminosity, with a
temperature a little lower than today. It will then have reached the red
clump or horizontal branch (HB), but a star of the Sun's mass does not
evolve blueward along the HB. Instead, it just becomes moderately larger
and more luminous over about 100 million years as it continues to burn
helium in the core.¹¹⁸

When the helium is exhausted, the Sun will repeat the expansion it followed
when the hydrogen in the core was exhausted, except that this time it all
happens faster, and the Sun becomes larger and more luminous. This is the
asymptotic-giant-branch (AGB) phase, and the Sun is alternately burning
hydrogen in a shell or helium in a deeper shell. After about 20 million
years on the early AGB, the Sun becomes increasingly unstable, with rapid
mass loss and thermal pulses that increase the size and luminosity for a
few hundred years every 100,000 years or so. The thermal pulses become
larger each time, with the later pulses pushing the luminosity to as much
as 5,000 times the current level and the radius to over 1 AU.¹²⁰ Models
vary depending on the rate and timing of mass loss. Models that have higher
mass loss on the RGB produce smaller, less luminous stars at the tip of the
AGB, perhaps only 2,000 times the luminosity and less than 200 times the
radius.¹¹⁸ For the Sun, four thermal pulses are predicted before it
completely loses its outer envelope and starts to make a planetary nebula.
By the end of that phase – lasting approximately 500,000 years – the Sun
will only have about half of its current mass.

The post AGB evolution is even faster. The luminosity stays approximately
constant as the temperature increases, with the ejected half of the Sun's
mass becoming ionised into a planetary nebula as the exposed core reaches
30,000 K. The final naked core temperature will be over 100,000 K, after
which the remnant will cool towards a white dwarf. The planetary nebula
will disperse in about 10,000 years, but the white dwarf will survive for
trillions of years before fading to black.¹²¹ ¹²²

Motion and location

Orbit in Milky Way

The Sun lies close to the inner rim of the Milky Way's Orion Arm, in the
Local Interstellar Cloud or the Gould Belt, at a distance of 7.5–8.5 kpc
(25,000–28,000 light-years) from the Galactic Center.¹²³ ¹²⁴ ¹²⁵ ¹²⁶ ¹²⁷
¹²⁸ The Sun is contained within the Local Bubble, a space of rarefied hot
gas, possibly produced by the supernova remnant Geminga.¹²⁹ The distance
between the local arm and the next arm out, the Perseus Arm, is about 6,500
light-years.¹³⁰ The Sun, and thus the Solar System, is found in what
scientists call the galactic habitable zone. The Apex of the Sun's Way, or
the solar apex, is the direction that the Sun travels through space in the
Milky Way, relative to other nearby stars. The general direction of the
Sun's galactic motion is towards the star Vega in the constellation of Lyra
at an angle of roughly 60 sky degrees to the direction of the Galactic
Center. Of the 50 nearest stellar systems within 17 light-years from Earth
(the closest being the red dwarf Proxima Centauri at approximately 4.2
light-years), the Sun ranks fourth in mass.¹³¹

The Sun's orbit around the Milky Way is expected to be roughly elliptical
with the addition of perturbations due to the galactic spiral arms and
non-uniform mass distributions. In addition the Sun oscillates up and down
relative to the galactic plane approximately 2.7 times per orbit. It has
been argued that the Sun's passage through the higher density spiral arms
often coincides with mass extinctions on Earth, perhaps due to increased
impact events.¹³² It takes the Solar System about 225–250 million years to
complete one orbit through the Milky Way (a galactic year),¹³³ so it is
thought to have completed 20–25 orbits during the lifetime of the Sun. The
orbital speed of the Solar System about the center of the Milky Way is
approximately 251 km/s (156 mi/s).¹³⁴ At this speed, it takes around 1,190
years for the Solar System to travel a distance of 1 light-year, or 7 days
to travel 1 AU.¹³⁵

Theoretical problems

Coronal heating problem

Main article: Corona

The temperature of the photosphere is approximately 6,000 K, whereas the
temperature of the corona reaches 1,000,000–2,000,000 K.⁸³ The high
temperature of the corona shows that it is heated by something other than
direct heat conduction from the photosphere.⁸⁵

It is thought that the energy necessary to heat the corona is provided by
turbulent motion in the convection zone below the photosphere, and two main
mechanisms have been proposed to explain coronal heating.⁸³ The first is
wave heating, in which sound, gravitational or magnetohydrodynamic waves
are produced by turbulence in the convection zone.⁸³ These waves travel
upward and dissipate in the corona, depositing their energy in the ambient
matter in the form of heat.¹³⁶ The other is magnetic heating, in which
magnetic energy is continuously built up by photospheric motion and
released through magnetic reconnection in the form of large solar flares
and myriad similar but smaller events—nanoflares.¹³⁷

Currently, it is unclear whether waves are an efficient heating mechanism.
All waves except Alfvén waves have been found to dissipate or refract
before reaching the corona.¹³⁸ In addition, Alfvén waves do not easily
dissipate in the corona. Current research focus has therefore shifted
towards flare heating mechanisms.⁸³

Faint young Sun problem

Main article: Faint young Sun paradox

Theoretical models of the Sun's development suggest that 3.8 to 2.5 billion
years ago, during the Archean period, the Sun was only about 75% as bright
as it is today. Such a weak star would not have been able to sustain liquid
water on Earth's surface, and thus life should not have been able to
develop. However, the geological record demonstrates that Earth has
remained at a fairly constant temperature throughout its history, and that
the young Earth was somewhat warmer than it is today. The consensus among
scientists is that the atmosphere of the young Earth contained much larger
quantities of greenhouse gases (such as carbon dioxide, methane and/or
ammonia) than are present today, which trapped enough heat to compensate
for the smaller amount of solar energy reaching it.¹³⁹

History of observation

The enormous effect of the Sun on the Earth has been recognized since
prehistoric times, and the Sun has been regarded by some cultures as a
deity.

Early understanding

See also: The Sun in culture

The Sun has been an object of veneration in many cultures throughout human
history. Humanity's most fundamental understanding of the Sun is as the
luminous disk in the sky, whose presence above the horizon creates day and
whose absence causes night. In many prehistoric and ancient cultures, the
Sun was thought to be a solar deity or other supernatural entity. Worship
of the Sun was central to civilizations such as the ancient Egyptians, the
Inca of South America and the Aztecs of what is now Mexico. In religions
such as Hinduism, the Sun is still considered a god. Many ancient monuments
were constructed with solar phenomena in mind; for example, stone megaliths
accurately mark the summer or winter solstice (some of the most prominent
megaliths are located in Nabta Playa, Egypt; Mnajdra, Malta and at
Stonehenge, England); Newgrange, a prehistoric human-built mount in
Ireland, was designed to detect the winter solstice; the pyramid of El
Castillo at Chichén Itzá in Mexico is designed to cast shadows in the shape
of serpents climbing the pyramid at the vernal and autumn equinoxes.

The Egyptians portrayed the god Ra as being carried across the sky in a
solar barque, accompanied by lesser gods, and to the Greeks, he was Helios,
carried by a chariot drawn by fiery horses. From the reign of Elagabalus in
the late Roman Empire the Sun's birthday was a holiday celebrated as Sol
Invictus (literally "Unconquered Sun") soon after the winter solstice,
which may have been an antecedent to Christmas. Regarding the fixed stars,
the Sun appears from Earth to revolve once a year along the ecliptic
through the zodiac, and so Greek astronomers considered it to be one of the
seven planets (Greek planetes, "wanderer"), after which the seven days of
the week are named in some languages.¹⁴⁰ ¹⁴¹ ¹⁴²

Development of scientific understanding

In the early first millennium BC, Babylonian astronomers observed that the
Sun's motion along the ecliptic is not uniform, though they did not know
why; it is today known that this is due to the movement of Earth in an
elliptic orbit around the Sun, with Earth moving faster when it is nearer
to the Sun at perihelion and moving slower when it is farther away at
aphelion.¹⁴³

One of the first people to offer a scientific or philosophical explanation
for the Sun was the Greek philosopher Anaxagoras, who reasoned that it is a
giant flaming ball of metal even larger than the Peloponnesus rather than
the chariot of Helios, and that the Moon reflected the light of the Sun.¹⁴⁴
For teaching this heresy, he was imprisoned by the authorities and
sentenced to death, though he was later released through the intervention
of Pericles. Eratosthenes estimated the distance between Earth and the Sun
in the 3rd century BC as "of stadia myriads 400 and 80000", the translation
of which is ambiguous, implying either 4,080,000 stadia (755,000 km) or
804,000,000 stadia (148 to 153 million kilometers or 0.99 to 1.02 AU); the
latter value is correct to within a few percent. In the 1st century AD,
Ptolemy estimated the distance as 1,210 times the radius of Earth,
approximately 7.71 million kilometers (0.0515 AU).¹⁴⁵

The theory that the Sun is the center around which the planets orbit was
first proposed by the ancient Greek Aristarchus of Samos in the 3rd century
BC, and later adopted by Seleucus of Seleucia (see Heliocentrism). This
largely philosophical view was developed into fully predictive mathematical
model of a heliocentric system in the 16th century by Nicolaus Copernicus.

Observations of sunspots were recorded during the Han Dynasty (206 BC–AD
220) by Chinese astronomers, who maintained records of these observations
for centuries. Averroes also provided a description of sunspots in the 12th
century.¹⁴⁶ The invention of the telescope in the early 17th century
permitted detailed observations of sunspots by Thomas Harriot, Galileo
Galilei and other astronomers. Galileo posited that sunspots were on the
surface of the Sun rather than small objects passing between Earth and the
Sun.¹⁴⁷

Arabic astronomical contributions include Albatenius' discovery that the
direction of the Sun's apogee (the place in the Sun's orbit against the
fixed stars where it seems to be moving slowest) is changing.¹⁴⁸ (In modern
heliocentric terms, this is caused by a gradual motion of the aphelion of
the Earth's orbit). Ibn Yunus observed more than 10,000 entries for the
Sun's position for many years using a large astrolabe.¹⁴⁹

From an observation of a transit of Venus in 1032, the Persian astronomer
and polymath Avicenna concluded that Venus is closer to Earth than the
Sun.¹⁵⁰ In 1672 Giovanni Cassini and Jean Richer determined the distance to
Mars and were thereby able to calculate the distance to the Sun.

In 1666, Isaac Newton observed the Sun's light using a prism, and showed
that it is made up of light of many colors.¹⁵¹ In 1800, William Herschel
discovered infrared radiation beyond the red part of the solar spectrum.¹⁵²
The 19th century saw advancement in spectroscopic studies of the Sun;
Joseph von Fraunhofer recorded more than 600 absorption lines in the
spectrum, the strongest of which are still often referred to as Fraunhofer
lines. In the early years of the modern scientific era, the source of the
Sun's energy was a significant puzzle. Lord Kelvin suggested that the Sun
is a gradually cooling liquid body that is radiating an internal store of
heat.¹⁵³ Kelvin and Hermann von Helmholtz then proposed a gravitational
contraction mechanism to explain the energy output, but the resulting age
estimate was only 20 million years, well short of the time span of at least
300 million years suggested by some geological discoveries of that time.¹⁵³
In 1890 Joseph Lockyer, who discovered helium in the solar spectrum,
proposed a meteoritic hypothesis for the formation and evolution of the
Sun.¹⁵⁴

Not until 1904 was a documented solution offered. Ernest Rutherford
suggested that the Sun's output could be maintained by an internal source
of heat, and suggested radioactive decay as the source.¹⁵⁵ However, it
would be Albert Einstein who would provide the essential clue to the source
of the Sun's energy output with his mass-energy equivalence relation E =
mc².¹⁵⁶ In 1920, Sir Arthur Eddington proposed that the pressures and
temperatures at the core of the Sun could produce a nuclear fusion reaction
that merged hydrogen (protons) into helium nuclei, resulting in a
production of energy from the net change in mass.¹⁵⁷ The preponderance of
hydrogen in the Sun was confirmed in 1925 by Cecilia Payne using the
ionization theory developed by Meghnad Saha, an Indian physicist. The
theoretical concept of fusion was developed in the 1930s by the
astrophysicists Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar and Hans Bethe. Hans Bethe
calculated the details of the two main energy-producing nuclear reactions
that power the Sun.¹⁵⁸ ¹⁵⁹ In 1957, Margaret Burbidge, Geoffrey Burbidge,
William Fowler and Fred Hoyle showed that most of the elements in the
universe have been synthesized by nuclear reactions inside stars, some like
the Sun.¹⁶⁰

Solar space missions

See also: Solar observatory

The first satellites designed to observe the Sun were NASA's Pioneers 5, 6,
7, 8 and 9, which were launched between 1959 and 1968. These probes orbited
the Sun at a distance similar to that of Earth, and made the first detailed
measurements of the solar wind and the solar magnetic field. Pioneer 9
operated for a particularly long time, transmitting data until May 1983.¹⁶²
¹⁶³

In the 1970s, two Helios spacecraft and the Skylab Apollo Telescope Mount
provided scientists with significant new data on solar wind and the solar
corona. The Helios 1 and 2 probes were U.S.–German collaborations that
studied the solar wind from an orbit carrying the spacecraft inside
Mercury's orbit at perihelion.¹⁶⁴ The Skylab space station, launched by
NASA in 1973, included a solar observatory module called the Apollo
Telescope Mount that was operated by astronauts resident on the station.⁸⁴
Skylab made the first time-resolved observations of the solar transition
region and of ultraviolet emissions from the solar corona.⁸⁴ Discoveries
included the first observations of coronal mass ejections, then called
"coronal transients", and of coronal holes, now known to be intimately
associated with the solar wind.¹⁶⁴

In 1980, the Solar Maximum Mission was launched by NASA. This spacecraft
was designed to observe gamma rays, X-rays and UV radiation from solar
flares during a time of high solar activity and solar luminosity. Just a
few months after launch, however, an electronics failure caused the probe
to go into standby mode, and it spent the next three years in this inactive
state. In 1984 Space Shuttle Challenger mission STS-41C retrieved the
satellite and repaired its electronics before re-releasing it into orbit.
The Solar Maximum Mission subsequently acquired thousands of images of the
solar corona before re-entering Earth's atmosphere in June 1989.¹⁶⁵

Launched in 1991, Japan's Yohkoh (Sunbeam) satellite observed solar flares
at X-ray wavelengths. Mission data allowed scientists to identify several
different types of flares, and demonstrated that the corona away from
regions of peak activity was much more dynamic and active than had
previously been supposed. Yohkoh observed an entire solar cycle but went
into standby mode when an annular eclipse in 2001 caused it to lose its
lock on the Sun. It was destroyed by atmospheric re-entry in 2005.¹⁶⁶

One of the most important solar missions to date has been the Solar and
Heliospheric Observatory, jointly built by the European Space Agency and
NASA and launched on 2 December 1995.⁸⁴ Originally intended to serve a
two-year mission, a mission extension through 2012 was approved in October
2009.¹⁶⁷ It has proven so useful that a follow-on mission, the Solar
Dynamics Observatory (SDO), was launched in February 2010.¹⁶⁸ Situated at
the Lagrangian point between Earth and the Sun (at which the gravitational
pull from both is equal), SOHO has provided a constant view of the Sun at
many wavelengths since its launch.⁸⁴ Besides its direct solar observation,
SOHO has enabled the discovery of a large number of comets, mostly tiny
sungrazing comets that incinerate as they pass the Sun.¹⁶⁹

All these satellites have observed the Sun from the plane of the ecliptic,
and so have only observed its equatorial regions in detail. The Ulysses
probe was launched in 1990 to study the Sun's polar regions. It first
travelled to Jupiter, to "slingshot" into an orbit that would take it far
above the plane of the ecliptic. Serendipitously, it was well-placed to
observe the collision of Comet Shoemaker–Levy 9 with Jupiter in 1994. Once
Ulysses was in its scheduled orbit, it began observing the solar wind and
magnetic field strength at high solar latitudes, finding that the solar
wind from high latitudes was moving at about 750 km/s, which was slower
than expected, and that there were large magnetic waves emerging from high
latitudes that scattered galactic cosmic rays.¹⁷⁰

Elemental abundances in the photosphere are well known from spectroscopic
studies, but the composition of the interior of the Sun is more poorly
understood. A solar wind sample return mission, Genesis, was designed to
allow astronomers to directly measure the composition of solar material.
Genesis returned to Earth in 2004 but was damaged by a crash landing after
its parachute failed to deploy on re-entry into Earth's atmosphere. Despite
severe damage, some usable samples have been recovered from the
spacecraft's sample return module and are undergoing analysis.¹⁷¹

The Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO) mission was launched
in October 2006. Two identical spacecraft were launched into orbits that
cause them to (respectively) pull further ahead of and fall gradually
behind Earth. This enables stereoscopic imaging of the Sun and solar
phenomena, such as coronal mass ejections.¹⁷² ¹⁷³

The Indian Space Research Organisation has scheduled the launch of a 100 kg
satellite named Aditya for 2017–18. Its main instrument will be a
coronagraph for studying the dynamics of the Solar corona.¹⁷⁴

Observation and effects

The brightness of the Sun can cause pain from looking at it with the naked
eye; however, doing so for brief periods is not hazardous for normal
non-dilated eyes.¹⁷⁵ ¹⁷⁶ Looking directly at the Sun causes phosphene
visual artifacts and temporary partial blindness. It also delivers about 4
milliwatts of sunlight to the retina, slightly heating it and potentially
causing damage in eyes that cannot respond properly to the brightness.¹⁷⁷
¹⁷⁸ UV exposure gradually yellows the lens of the eye over a period of
years, and is thought to contribute to the formation of cataracts, but this
depends on general exposure to solar UV, and not whether one looks directly
at the Sun.¹⁷⁹ Long-duration viewing of the direct Sun with the naked eye
can begin to cause UV-induced, sunburn-like lesions on the retina after
about 100 seconds, particularly under conditions where the UV light from
the Sun is intense and well focused;¹⁸⁰ ¹⁸¹ conditions are worsened by
young eyes or new lens implants (which admit more UV than aging natural
eyes), Sun angles near the zenith, and observing locations at high
altitude.

Viewing the Sun through light-concentrating optics such as binoculars may
result in permanent damage to the retina without an appropriate filter that
blocks UV and substantially dims the sunlight. When using an attenuating
filter to view the Sun, the viewer is cautioned to use a filter
specifically designed for that use. Some improvised filters that pass UV or
IR rays, can actually harm the eye at high brightness levels.¹⁸² Herschel
wedges, also called Solar Diagonals, are effective and inexpensive for
small telescopes. The sunlight that is destined for the eyepiece is
reflected from an unsilvered surface of a piece of glass. Only a very small
fraction of the incident light is reflected. The rest passes through the
glass and leaves the instrument. If the glass breaks because of the heat,
no light at all is reflected, making the device fail-safe. Simple filters
made of darkened glass allow the full intensity of sunlight to pass through
if they break, endangering the observer's eyesight. Unfiltered binoculars
can deliver hundreds of times as much energy as using the naked eye,
possibly causing immediate damage. It is claimed that even brief glances at
the midday Sun through an unfiltered telescope can cause permanent
damage.¹⁸³

Partial solar eclipses are hazardous to view because the eye's pupil is not
adapted to the unusually high visual contrast: the pupil dilates according
to the total amount of light in the field of view, not by the brightest
object in the field. During partial eclipses most sunlight is blocked by
the Moon passing in front of the Sun, but the uncovered parts of the
photosphere have the same surface brightness as during a normal day. In the
overall gloom, the pupil expands from ~2 mm to ~6 mm, and each retinal cell
exposed to the solar image receives up to ten times more light than it
would looking at the non-eclipsed Sun. This can damage or kill those cells,
resulting in small permanent blind spots for the viewer.¹⁸⁴ The hazard is
insidious for inexperienced observers and for children, because there is no
perception of pain: it is not immediately obvious that one's vision is
being destroyed.

During sunrise and sunset, sunlight is attenuated because of Rayleigh
scattering and Mie scattering from a particularly long passage through
Earth's atmosphere,¹⁸⁵ and the Sun is sometimes faint enough to be viewed
comfortably with the naked eye or safely with optics (provided there is no
risk of bright sunlight suddenly appearing through a break between clouds).
Hazy conditions, atmospheric dust, and high humidity contribute to this
atmospheric attenuation.¹⁸⁶

An optical phenomenon, known as a green flash, can sometimes be seen
shortly after sunset or before sunrise. The flash is caused by light from
the Sun just below the horizon being bent (usually through a temperature
inversion) towards the observer. Light of shorter wavelengths (violet,
blue, green) is bent more than that of longer wavelengths (yellow, orange,
red) but the violet and blue light is scattered more, leaving light that is
perceived as green.¹⁸⁷

Ultraviolet light from the Sun has antiseptic properties and can be used to
sanitize tools and water. It also causes sunburn, and has other medical
effects such as the production of vitamin D. Ultraviolet light is strongly
attenuated by Earth's ozone layer, so that the amount of UV varies greatly
with latitude and has been partially responsible for many biological
adaptations, including variations in human skin color in different regions
of the globe.¹⁸⁸

Notes

[1] It is sometimes said that "Sol" is an alternative name for the Sun. It
  is the word for "Sun" in Latin and some modern European languages and is
  the root of some English words, such as "solar". However, it is not
  included, on its own and in this sense, in English dictionaries, so it is
  not considered correct English. Nevertheless, it is sometimes found in
  science fiction.
[2] All numbers in this article are short scale. One billion is 10⁹, or
  1,000,000,000.
[3] In astronomical sciences, the term heavy elements (or metals) refers to
  all elements except hydrogen and helium.
[4] Hydrothermal vent communities live so deep under the sea that they have
  no access to sunlight. Bacteria instead use sulfur compounds as an energy
  source, via chemosynthesis.
[5] A 50 kg adult human has a volume of about 0.05 m³, which corresponds to
  13.8 watts, at the volumetric power of the solar center. This is 285
  kcal/day, about 10% of the actual average caloric intake and output for
  humans in non-stressful conditions.
[6] Earth's atmosphere near sea level has a particle density of about
  2×10²⁵ m−3.

Supernova

This article is about the astronomical event. For other uses, see Supernova
(disambiguation).

A supernova is a stellar explosion that briefly outshines an entire galaxy,
radiating as much energy as the Sun or any ordinary star is expected to
emit over its entire life span, before fading from view over several weeks
or months.¹ The extremely luminous burst of radiation expels much or all of
a star's material² at a velocity of up to 30,000 km/s (10% of the speed of
light), driving a shock wave³ into the surrounding interstellar medium.
This shock wave sweeps up an expanding shell of gas and dust called a
supernova remnant. Supernovae are potentially strong galactic sources of
gravitational waves.⁴ A great proportion of primary cosmic rays comes from
supernovae.⁵

Supernovae are more energetic than novae. Nova means "new" in Latin,
referring to what appears to be a very bright new star shining in the
celestial sphere; the prefix "super-" distinguishes supernovae from
ordinary novae, which are far less luminous. The word supernova was coined
by Walter Baade and Fritz Zwicky in 1931.⁶ It is pronounced /ˌsuːpərnoʊvə/
with the plural supernovae /ˌsuːpərnoʊviː/ or supernovas (abbreviated SN,
plural SNe after "supernovae").

Supernovae can be triggered in one of two ways: by the sudden re-ignition
of nuclear fusion in a degenerate star; or by the gravitational collapse of
the core of a massive star. In the first case, a degenerate white dwarf may
accumulate sufficient material from a companion, either through accretion
or via a merger, to raise its core temperature, ignite carbon fusion, and
trigger runaway nuclear fusion, completely disrupting the star. In the
second case, the core of a massive star may undergo sudden gravitational
collapse, releasing gravitational potential energy that can create a
supernova explosion.

The most recent directly observed supernova in the Milky Way was Kepler's
Star of 1604 (SN 1604); remnants of two more recent supernovae have been
found retrospectively.⁷ Observations in other galaxies indicate that
supernovae should occur on average about three times every century in the
Milky Way, and that any galactic supernova would almost certainly be
observable in modern astronomical equipment.⁸ Supernovae play a significant
role in enriching the interstellar medium with higher mass elements.⁹
Furthermore, the expanding shock waves from supernova explosions can
trigger the formation of new stars.¹⁰ ¹¹

Observation history

The highlighted passages refer to the Chinese observation of SN 1054

Hipparchus' interest in the fixed stars may have been inspired by the
observation of a supernova (according to Pliny).¹² The earliest recorded
supernova, SN 185, was viewed by Chinese astronomers in 185 AD. The
brightest recorded supernova was the SN 1006, which was described in detail
by Chinese and Islamic astronomers.¹³ The widely observed supernova SN 1054
produced the Crab Nebula. Supernovae SN 1572 and SN 1604, the latest to be
observed with the naked eye in the Milky Way galaxy, had notable effects on
the development of astronomy in Europe because they were used to argue
against the Aristotelian idea that the universe beyond the Moon and planets
was immutable.¹⁴ Johannes Kepler began observing SN 1604 at its peak on
October 17, 1604, and continued to make estimates of its brightness until
it faded from naked eye view a year later.¹⁵ It was the second supernova to
be observed in a generation (after SN 1572 seen by Tycho Brahe in
Cassiopeia).¹²

Since the development of the telescope, the field of supernova discovery
has extended to other galaxies, starting with the 1885 observation of
supernova S Andromedae in the Andromeda galaxy. American astronomers
Rudolph Minkowski and Fritz Zwicky developed the modern supernova
classification scheme beginning in 1941.¹⁶ In the 1960s, astronomers found
that the maximum intensities of supernova explosions could be used as
standard candles, hence indicators of astronomical distances.¹⁷ Some of the
most distant supernovae recently observed appeared dimmer than expected.
This supports the view that the expansion of the universe is
accelerating.¹⁸ Techniques were developed for reconstructing supernova
explosions that have no written records of being observed. The date of the
Cassiopeia A supernova event was determined from light echoes off
nebulae,¹⁹ while the age of supernova remnant RX J0852.0-4622 was estimated
from temperature measurements²⁰ and the gamma ray emissions from the decay
of titanium-44.²¹ In 2009, nitrates were discovered in Antarctic ice
deposits that matched the times of past supernova events.²²

Discovery

Main article: History of supernova observation § Telescope observation

Early work on what was originally believed to be simply a new category of
novae was performed during the 1930s by Walter Baade and Fritz Zwicky at
Mount Wilson Observatory.²³ The name super-novae was first used during 1931
lectures held at Caltech by Baade and Zwicky, then used publicly in 1933 at
a meeting of the American Physical Society.⁶ By 1938, the hyphen had been
lost and the modern name was in use.²⁴ Because supernovae are relatively
rare events within a galaxy, occurring about three times a century in the
Milky Way,⁷ obtaining a good sample of supernovae to study requires regular
monitoring of many galaxies.

Supernovae in other galaxies cannot be predicted with any meaningful
accuracy. Normally, when they are discovered, they are already in
progress.²⁵ Most scientific interest in supernovae—as standard candles for
measuring distance, for example—require an observation of their peak
luminosity. It is therefore important to discover them well before they
reach their maximum. Amateur astronomers, who greatly outnumber
professional astronomers, have played an important role in finding
supernovae, typically by looking at some of the closer galaxies through an
optical telescope and comparing them to earlier photographs.²⁶

Toward the end of the 20th century astronomers increasingly turned to
computer-controlled telescopes and CCDs for hunting supernovae. While such
systems are popular with amateurs, there are also professional
installations such as the Katzman Automatic Imaging Telescope.²⁷ Recently
the Supernova Early Warning System (SNEWS) project has begun using a
network of neutrino detectors to give early warning of a supernova in the
Milky Way galaxy.²⁸ ²⁹ Neutrinos are particles that are produced in great
quantities by a supernova explosion,³⁰ and they are not significantly
absorbed by the interstellar gas and dust of the galactic disk.

Supernova searches fall into two classes: those focused on relatively
nearby events and those looking for explosions farther away. Because of the
expansion of the universe, the distance to a remote object with a known
emission spectrum can be estimated by measuring its Doppler shift (or
redshift); on average, more distant objects recede with greater velocity
than those nearby, and so have a higher redshift. Thus the search is split
between high redshift and low redshift, with the boundary falling around a
redshift range of z = 0.1–0.3³² —where z is a dimensionless measure of the
spectrum's frequency shift.

High redshift searches for supernovae usually involve the observation of
supernova light curves. These are useful for standard or calibrated candles
to generate Hubble diagrams and make cosmological predictions. Supernova
spectroscopy, used to study the physics and environments of supernovae, is
more practical at low than at high redshift.³³ ³⁴ Low redshift observations
also anchor the low-distance end of the Hubble curve, which is a plot of
distance versus redshift for visible galaxies.³⁵ ³⁶ (See also Hubble's
law).

Naming convention

Supernova discoveries are reported to the International Astronomical
Union's Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams, which sends out a
circular with the name it assigns to that supernova. The name is the marker
SN followed by the year of discovery, suffixed with a one or two-letter
designation. The first 26 supernovae of the year are designated with a
capital letter from A to Z. Afterward pairs of lower-case letters are used:
aa, ab, and so on. Hence, for example, SN 2003C designates the third
supernova reported in the year 2003.³⁷ The last supernova of 2005 was SN
2005nc, indicating that it was the 367th[nb 1] supernova found in 2005.
Since 2000, professional and amateur astronomers have been finding several
hundreds of supernovae each year (572 in 2007, 261 in 2008, 390 in 2009;
231 in 2013).³⁸ ³⁹

Historical supernovae are known simply by the year they occurred: SN 185,
SN 1006, SN 1054, SN 1572 (called Tycho's Nova) and SN 1604 (Kepler's
Star). Since 1885 the additional letter notation has been used, even if
there was only one supernova discovered that year (e.g. SN 1885A, SN 1907A,
etc.) — this last happened with SN 1947A. SN, for SuperNova, is a standard
prefix. Until 1987, two-letter designations were rarely needed; since 1988,
however, they have been needed every year.

Classification

As part of the attempt to understand supernovae, astronomers have
classified them according to their light curves and the absorption lines of
different chemical elements that appear in their spectra. The first element
for division is the presence or absence of a line caused by hydrogen. If a
supernova's spectrum contains lines of hydrogen (known as the Balmer series
in the visual portion of the spectrum) it is classified Type II; otherwise
it is Type I. In each of these two types there are subdivisions according
to the presence of lines from other elements or the shape of the light
curve (a graph of the supernova's apparent magnitude as a function of
time).⁴¹ ⁴²

Type I

The type I supernovae are subdivided on the basis of their spectra, with
type Ia showing a strong ionised silicon absorption line. Type I supernovae
without this strong line are classified as types Ib and Ic, with type Ib
showing strong neutral helium lines and type Ic lacking them. The light
curves are all similar, although type Ia are generally brighter at peak
luminosity, but the light curve is not important for classification of type
I supernovae.

A small number of type Ia supernovae exhibit unusual features such as
non-standard luminosity or broadened light curves, and these are typically
classified by referring to the earliest example showing similar features.
For example, the sub-luminous SN 2008ha is often referred to as SN
2002cx-like or class Ia-2002cx.

Type II

The supernovae of Type II can also be sub-divided based on their spectra.
While most Type II supernovae show very broad emission lines which indicate
expansion velocities of many thousands of kilometres per second, some, such
as SN 2005gl, have relatively narrow features in their spectra. These are
called Type IIn, where the 'n' stands for 'narrow'.

A few supernovae, such as SN 1987K and SN 1993J, appear to change types:
they show lines of hydrogen at early times, but, over a period of weeks to
months, become dominated by lines of helium. The term "Type IIb" is used to
describe the combination of features normally associated with Types II and
Ib.⁴²

Type II supernovae with normal spectra dominated by broad hydrogen lines
that remain for the life of the decline are classified on the basis of
their light curves. The most common type shows a distinctive "plateau" in
the light curve shortly after peak brightness where the visual luminosity
stays relatively constant for several months before the decline resumes.
These are called type II-P referring to the plateau. Less common are type
II-L supernovae that lack a distinct plateau. The "L" signifies "linear"
although the light curve is not actually a straight line.

Supernovae that do not fit into the normal classifications are designated
peculiar, or 'pec'.⁴²

Types III, IV, and V

Fritz Zwicky defined additional supernovae types, although based on a very
few examples that didn't cleanly fit the parameters for a type I or type II
supernova. SN 1961i in NGC 4303 was the prototype and only member of the
type III supernova class, noted for its broad light curve maximum and broad
hydrogen Balmer lines that were slow to develop in the spectrum. SN 1961f
in NGC 3003 was the prototype and only member of the type IV class, with a
light curve similar to a type II-P supernova, with hydrogen absorption
lines but weak hydrogen emission lines. The type V class was coined for SN
1961V in NGC 1058, an unusual faint supernova or supernova imposter with a
slow rise to brightness, a maximum lasting many months, and an unusual
emission spectrum. The similarity of SN 1961V to the Eta Carinae Great
Outburst was noted.⁴⁴ Supernovae in M101 (1909) and M83 (1923 and 1957)
were also suggested as possible type IV or type V supernovae.⁴⁵

These types would now all be treated as peculiar type II supernovae, of
which many more examples have been discovered, although it is still debated
whether SN 1961V was a true supernova following an LBV outburst or an
imposter.⁴³

Current models

The type codes described above that astronomers give to supernovae are
taxonomic in nature: the type number describes the light observed from the
supernova, not necessarily its cause. For example, type Ia supernovae are
produced by runaway fusion ignited on degenerate white dwarf progenitors
while the spectrally similar type Ib/c are produced from massive Wolf-Rayet
progenitors by core collapse. The following summarizes what astronomers
currently believe are the most plausible explanations for supernovae.

Thermal runaway

Main article: Type Ia supernova

A white dwarf star may accumulate sufficient material from a stellar
companion to raise its core temperature enough to ignite carbon fusion, at
which point it undergoes runaway nuclear fusion, completely disrupting it.
There are three avenues by which this detonation is theorized to happen:
stable accretion of material from a companion, the collision of two white
dwarfs, or accretion that causes ignition in a shell that then ignites. The
dominant mechanism by which Type Ia supernovae are produced remains
unclear.⁴⁷ Despite this uncertainty in how Type Ia supernovae are produced,
Type Ia supernovae have very uniform properties, and are useful standard
candles over intergalactic distances. Some calibrations are required to
compensate for the gradual change in properties or different frequencies of
abnormal luminosity supernovae at high red shift, and for small variations
in brightness identified by light curve shape or spectrum.⁴⁸ ⁴⁹

Normal Type Ia

There are several means by which a supernova of this type can form, but
they share a common underlying mechanism. If a carbon-oxygen[nb 2] white
dwarf accreted enough matter to reach the Chandrasekhar limit of about 1.44
solar masses (M☉)⁵⁰ (for a non-rotating star), it would no longer be able
to support the bulk of its plasma through electron degeneracy pressure⁵¹ ⁵²
and would begin to collapse. However, the current view is that this limit
is not normally attained; increasing temperature and density inside the
core ignite carbon fusion as the star approaches the limit (to within about
1%⁵³ ), before collapse is initiated.⁵⁰

Within a few seconds, a substantial fraction of the matter in the white
dwarf undergoes nuclear fusion, releasing enough energy (1–2×10⁴⁴ J)⁵⁴ to
unbind the star in a supernova explosion.⁵⁵ An outwardly expanding shock
wave is generated, with matter reaching velocities on the order of
5,000–20,000 km/s, or roughly 3% of the speed of light. There is also a
significant increase in luminosity, reaching an absolute magnitude of −19.3
(or 5 billion times brighter than the Sun), with little variation.⁵⁶

The model for the formation of this category of supernova is a closed
binary star system. The larger of the two stars is the first to evolve off
the main sequence, and it expands to form a red giant. The two stars now
share a common envelope, causing their mutual orbit to shrink. The giant
star then sheds most of its envelope, losing mass until it can no longer
continue nuclear fusion. At this point it becomes a white dwarf star,
composed primarily of carbon and oxygen.⁵⁷ Eventually the secondary star
also evolves off the main sequence to form a red giant. Matter from the
giant is accreted by the white dwarf, causing the latter to increase in
mass. Despite widespread acceptance of the basic model, the exact details
of initiation and of the heavy elements produced in the explosion are still
unclear.

Type Ia supernovae follow a characteristic light curve—the graph of
luminosity as a function of time—after the explosion. This luminosity is
generated by the radioactive decay of nickel-56 through cobalt-56 to
iron-56.⁵⁶ The peak luminosity of the light curve is extremely consistent
across normal Type Ia supernovae, having a maximum absolute magnitude of
about −19.3. This allows them to be used as a secondary⁵⁸ standard candle
to measure the distance to their host galaxies.⁵⁹

Non-standard Type Ia

Another model for the formation of a Type Ia explosion involves the merger
of two white dwarf stars, with the combined mass momentarily exceeding the
Chandrasekhar limit.⁶⁰ There is much variation in this type of explosion,⁶¹
and in many cases there may be no supernova at all, but it is expected that
they will have a broader and less luminous light curve than the more normal
Type Ia explosions.

Abnormally bright Type Ia supernovae are expected when the white dwarf
already has a mass higher than the Chandrasekhar limit,⁶² possibly enhanced
further by asymmetry,⁶³ but the ejected material will have less than normal
kinetic energy.

There is no formal sub-classification for the non-standard Type Ia
supernovae. It has been proposed that a group of sub-luminous supernovae
that occur when helium accretes onto a white dwarf should be classified as
type Iax.⁶⁴ ⁶⁵ This type of supernova may not always completely destroy the
white dwarf progenitor and could leave behind a zombie star.⁶⁶

One specific type of non-standard Type Ia supernova develops hydrogen, and
other, emission lines and gives the appearance of mixture between a normal
Type Ia and a Type IIn supernova. Examples are SN 2002ic and SN 2005gj.
These supernova have been dubbed Type Ia/IIn, Type Ian, Type IIa and Type
IIan.⁶⁷

Core collapse

Very massive stars can undergo core collapse when nuclear fusion suddenly
becomes unable to sustain the core against its own gravity; this is the
cause of all types of supernova except type Ia. The collapse may cause
violent expulsion of the outer layers of the star resulting in a supernova,
or the release of gravitational potential energy may be insufficient and
the star may collapse into a black hole or neutron star with little
radiated energy.

Core collapse can be caused by several different mechanisms: electron
capture; exceeding the Chandrasekhar limit; pair-instability; or
photodisintegration.² ⁶⁸ When a massive star develops an iron core larger
than the Chandrasekhar mass it will no longer be able to support itself by
electron degeneracy pressure and will collapse further to a neutron star or
black hole. Electron capture by magnesium in a degenerate O/Ne/Mg core
causes gravitational collapse followed by explosive oxygen fusion, with
very similar results. Electron-positron pair production in a large
post-helium burning core removes thermodynamic support and causes initial
collapse followed by runaway fusion, resulting in a pair-instability
supernova. A sufficiently large and hot stellar core may generate
gamma-rays energetic enough to initiate photodisintegration directly, which
will cause a complete collapse of the core.

The table below lists the known reasons for core collapse in massive stars,
the types of star that they occur in, their associated supernova type, and
the remnant produced. The metallicity is the proportion of elements other
than hydrogen or helium, as compared to the Sun. The initial mass is the
mass of the star prior to the supernova event, given in multiples of the
Sun's mass, although the mass at the time of the supernova may be much
lower.

Type IIn supernovae are not listed in the table. They can potentially be
produced by various types of core collapse in different progenitor stars,
possibly even by type Ia white dwarf ignitions, although it seems that most
will be from iron core collapse in luminous supergiants or hypergiants
(including LBVs). The narrow spectral lines for which they are named occur
because the supernova is expanding into a small dense cloud of
circumstellar material.⁶⁹ It appears that a significant proportion of
supposed type IIn supernovae are actually supernova imposters, massive
eruptions of LBV-like stars similar to the Great Eruption Eta Carinae. In
these events, material previously ejected from the star creates the narrow
absorption lines and causes a shock wave through interaction with the newly
ejected material.⁷⁰

When a stellar core is no longer supported against gravity it collapses in
on itself with velocities reaching 70,000 km/s (0.23c),⁷¹ resulting in a
rapid increase in temperature and density. What follows next depends on the
mass and structure of the collapsing core, with low mass degenerate cores
forming neutron stars, higher mass degenerate cores mostly collapsing
completely to black holes, and non-degenerate cores undergoing runaway
fusion.

The initial collapse of degenerate cores is accelerated by beta decay,
photodisintegration and electron capture, which causes a burst of electron
neutrinos. As the density increases, neutrino emission is cut off as they
become trapped in the core. The inner core eventually reaches typically 30
km diameter⁷² and a density comparable to that of an atomic nucleus, and
neutron degeneracy pressure tries to halt the collapse. If the core mass is
more than about 15 M☉ then neutron degeneracy is insufficient to stop the
collapse and a black hole forms directly with no supernova explosion.

In lower mass cores the collapse is stopped and the newly formed neutron
core has an initial temperature of about 100 billion kelvin, 6000 times the
temperature of the sun's core.⁷³ 'Thermal' neutrinos form as
neutrino-antineutrino pairs of all flavors, and total several times the
number of electron-capture neutrinos.⁷⁴ About 10⁴⁶ joules, approximately
10% of the star's rest mass, is converted into a ten-second burst of
neutrinos which is the main output of the event.⁷² ⁷⁵ The suddenly halted
core collapse rebounds and produces a shock wave that stalls within
milliseconds⁷⁶ in the outer core as energy is lost through the dissociation
of heavy elements. A process that is not clearly understood is necessary to
allow the outer layers of the core to reabsorb around 10⁴⁴ joules⁷⁵ (1 foe)
from the neutrino pulse, producing the visible explosion, although there
are also other theories on how to power the explosion.⁷²

Some material from the outer envelope falls back onto the neutron star, and
for cores beyond about 8 M☉ there is sufficient fallback to form a black
hole. This fallback will reduce the kinetic energy of the explosion and the
mass of expelled radioactive material, but in some situations it may also
generate relativistic jets that result in a gamma-ray burst or an
exceptionally luminous supernova.

Collapse of massive non-degenerate cores will ignite further fusion. When
the core collapse is initiated by pair instability, oxygen fusion begins
and the collapse may be halted. For core masses of 40–60 M☉, the collapse
halts and the star remains intact, but core collapse will occur again when
a larger core has formed. For cores of around 60–130 M☉, the fusion of
oxygen and heavier elements is so energetic that the entire star is
disrupted, causing a supernova. At the upper end of the mass range, the
supernova is unusually luminous and extremely long-lived due to many solar
masses of ejected Ni₅₆. For even larger core masses, the core temperature
becomes high enough to allow photodisintegration and the core collapses
completely into a black hole.⁷⁷

Type II

Main article: Type II supernova

Stars with initial masses less than about eight times the sun never develop
a core large enough to collapse and they eventually lose their atmospheres
to become white dwarfs. Stars with at least 9 M☉ (possibly as much as 12
M☉⁷⁸ ) evolve in a complex fashion, progressively burning heavier elements
at hotter temperatures in their cores.⁷² ⁷⁹ The star becomes layered like
an onion, with the burning of more easily fused elements occurring in
larger shells.² ⁸⁰ Although popularly described as an onion with an iron
core, the least massive supernova progenitors only have
oxygen-neon(-magnesium) cores. These super AGB stars may form the majority
of core collapse supernovae, although less luminous and so less commonly
observed than those from more massive progenitors.⁷⁸

If core collapse occurs during a supergiant phase when the star still has a
hydrogen envelope, the result is a type II supernova. The rate of mass loss
for luminous stars depends on the metallicity and luminosity. Extremely
luminous stars at near solar metallicity will lose all their hydrogen
before they reach core collapse and so will not form a type II supernova.
At low metallicity, all stars will reach core collapse with a hydrogen
envelope but sufficiently massive stars collapse directly to a black hole
without producing a visible supernova.

Stars with an initial mass up to about 90 times the sun, or a little less
at high metallicity, are expected to result in a type II-P supernova which
is the most commonly observed type. At moderate to high metallicity, stars
near the upper end of that mass range will have lost most of their hydrogen
when core collapse occurs and the result will be a type II-L supernova. At
very low metallicity, stars of around 140–250 M☉ will reach core collapse
by pair instability while they still have a hydrogen atmosphere and an
oxygen core and the result will be a supernova with type II characteristics
but a very large mass of ejected ⁵⁶Ni and high luminosity.

Type Ib and Ic

Main article: Type Ib and Ic supernovae

These supernovae, like those of Type II, are massive stars that undergo
core collapse. However the stars which become Types Ib and Ic supernovae
have lost most of their outer (hydrogen) envelopes due to strong stellar
winds or else from interaction with a companion.⁸³ These stars are known as
Wolf-Rayet stars, and they occur at moderate to high metallicity where
continuum driven winds cause sufficiently high mass loss rates.
Observations of type Ib/c supernova do not match the observed or expected
occurrence of Wolf Rayet stars and alternate explanations for this type of
core collapse supernova involve stars stripped of their hydrogen by binary
interactions. Binary models provide a better match for the observed
supernovae, with the proviso that no suitable binary helium stars have ever
been observed.⁸⁴ Since a supernova explosion can occur whenever the mass of
the star at the time of core collapse is low enough not to cause complete
fallback to a black hole, any massive star may result in a supernova if it
loses enough mass before core collapse occurs.

Type Ib supernovae are the more common and result from Wolf-Rayet stars of
type WC which still have helium in their atmospheres. For a narrow range of
masses, stars evolve further before reaching core collapse to become WO
stars with very little helium remaining and these are the progenitors of
type Ic supernovae.

A few percent of the Type Ic supernovae are associated with gamma-ray
bursts (GRB), though it is also believed that any hydrogen-stripped Type Ib
or Ic supernova could produce a GRB, depending on the geometry of the
explosion.⁸⁵ The mechanism for producing this type of GRB is the jets
produced by the magnetic field of the rapidly spinning magnetar formed at
the collapsing core of the star. The jets would also transfer energy into
the expanding outer shell of the explosion to produce a super-luminous
supernova.⁸⁶

Ultra-stripped supernovae occur when the exploding star has been stripped
(almost) all the way to the metal core, via mass transfer in a close
binary.⁸⁷ As a result, very little material is ejected from the exploding
star (~0.1 MSun). In the most extreme cases, ultra-stripped supernovae can
occur in naked metal cores, barely above the Chandrasekhar mass limit. SN
2005ek ⁸⁸ might be an observational example of an ultra-stripped supernova,
giving rise to a relatively dim and fast decaying light curve. The nature
of ultra-stripped supernovae can be both iron core-collapse and electron
capture supernovae, depending on the mass of the collapsing core.

Failed

The core collapse of some massive stars may not result in a visible
supernova. The main model for this is a sufficiently massive core that the
explosion is insufficient to reverse the infall of the outer layers onto a
black hole. These events are difficult to detect, but large surveys have
detected possible candidates.⁸⁹ ⁹⁰

Light curves

The visual light curves of the different supernova types vary in shape and
amplitude, based on the underlying mechanisms of the explosion, the way
that visible radiation is produced, and the transparency of the ejected
material. The light curves can be significantly different at other
wavelengths. For example, at UV and shorter wavelengths there is an
extremely luminous peak lasting just a few hours, corresponding to the
shock breakout of the initial explosion, which is hardly detectable at
longer wavelengths.

The light curves for type Ia are mostly very uniform, with a consistent
maximum absolute magnitude and a relatively steep decline in luminosity.
The energy output is driven by radioactive decay of nickel-56 (half life 6
days), which then decays to radioactive cobalt-56 (half life 77 days).
These radioisotopes from material ejected in the explosion excite
surrounding material to incandescence. The initial phases of the light
curve decline steeply as the effective size of the photosphere decreases
and trapped electromagnetic radiation is depleted. The light curve
continues to decline in the B band while it may show a small shoulder in
the visual at about 40 days, but this is only a hint of a secondary maximum
that occurs in the infra-red as certain ionised heavy elements recombine to
produce infra-red radiation and the ejecta become transparent to it. The
visual light curve continues to decline at a rate slightly greater than the
decay rate of the radioactive cobalt (which has the longer half life and
controls the later curve), because the ejected material becomes more
diffuse and less able to convert the high energy radiation into visual
radiation. After several months, the light curve changes its decline rate
again as positron emission becomes dominant from the remaining cobalt-56,
although this portion of the light curve has been little-studied.

Type Ib and Ic light curves are basically similar to type Ia although with
a lower average peak luminosity. The visual light output is again due to
radioactive decay being converted into visual radiation, but there is a
much lower mass of nickel-56 produced in these types of explosion. The peak
luminosity varies considerably and there are even occasional type Ib/c
supernovae orders of magnitude more and less luminous than the norm. The
most luminous type Ic supernovae are referred to as hypernovae and tend to
have broadened light curves in addition to the increases peak luminosity.
The source of the extra energy is thought to be relativistic jets driven by
the formation of a rotating black hole, which also produce gamma-ray
bursts.

The light curves for type II supernovae are characterised by a much slower
decline than type I, on the order of 0.05 magnitudes per day,⁹¹ excluding
the plateau phase. The visual light output is dominated by kinetic energy
rather than radioactive decay for several months, due primarily to the
existence of hydrogen in the ejecta from the atmosphere of the supergiant
progenitor star. In the initial explosion this hydrogen becomes heated and
ionised. The majority of type II supernovae show a prolonged plateau in
their light curves as this hydrogen recombines, emitting visible light and
becoming more transparent. This is then followed by a declining light curve
driven by radioactive decay although slower than in type I supernovae, due
to the efficiency of conversion into light by all the hydrogen.⁴³

In type II-L the plateau is absent because the progenitor had relatively
little hydrogen left in its atmosphere, sufficient to appear in the
spectrum but insufficient to produce a noticeable plateau in the light
output. In type IIb supernovae the hydrogen atmosphere of the progenitor is
so depleted (thought to be due to tidal stripping by a companion star) that
the light curve is closer to a type I supernova and the hydrogen even
disappears from the spectrum after several weeks.⁴³

Type IIn supernovae are characterised by additional narrow spectral lines
produced in a dense shell of circumstellar material. Their light curves are
generally very broad and extended, occasionally also extremely luminous and
referred to as a hypernova. These light curves are produced by the highly
efficient conversion of kinetic energy of the ejecta into electromagnetic
radiation by interaction with the dense shell of material. This only occurs
when the material is sufficiently dense and compact, indicating that it has
been produced by the progenitor star itself only shortly before the
supernova occurs.

Large numbers of supernovae have been catalogued and classified to provide
distance candles and test models. Average characteristics vary somewhat
with distance and type of host galaxy, but can broadly be specified for
each supernova type.

  supernovae.

Asymmetry

A long-standing puzzle surrounding Type II supernovae is why the compact
object remaining after the explosion is given a large velocity away from
the epicentre;⁹⁵ pulsars, and thus neutron stars, are observed to have high
velocities, and black holes presumably do as well, although they are far
harder to observe in isolation. The initial impetus can be substantial,
propelling an object of more than a solar mass at a velocity of 500 km/s or
greater. This indicates an asymmetry in the explosion, but the mechanism by
which momentum is transferred to the compact object remains a puzzle.
Proposed explanations for this kick include convection in the collapsing
star and jet production during neutron star formation.

One possible explanation for the asymmetry in the explosion is large-scale
convection above the core. The convection can create variations in the
local abundances of elements, resulting in uneven nuclear burning during
the collapse, bounce and resulting explosion.⁹⁶

Another possible explanation is that accretion of gas onto the central
neutron star can create a disk that drives highly directional jets,
propelling matter at a high velocity out of the star, and driving
transverse shocks that completely disrupt the star. These jets might play a
crucial role in the resulting supernova explosion.⁹⁷ ⁹⁸ (A similar model is
now favored for explaining long gamma-ray bursts.)

Initial asymmetries have also been confirmed in Type Ia supernova
explosions through observation. This result may mean that the initial
luminosity of this type of supernova depends on the viewing angle. However,
the explosion becomes more symmetrical with the passage of time. Early
asymmetries are detectable by measuring the polarization of the emitted
light.⁹⁹

Energy output

Although we are used to thinking of supernovae primarily as luminous
visible events, the electromagnetic radiation they produce is almost a
minor side-effect of the explosion. Particularly in the case of core
collapse supernovae, the emitted electromagnetic radiation is a tiny
fraction of the total event energy.

There is a fundamental difference between the balance of energy production
in the different types of supernova. In type Ia white dwarf detonations,
most of the explosion energy is directed into heavy element synthesis and
kinetic energy of the ejecta. In core collapse supernovae, the vast
majority of the energy is directed into neutrino emission, and while some
of this apparently powers the main explosion 99%+ of the neutrinos escape
in the first few minutes following the start of the collapse.

Type Ia supernovae derive their energy from runaway nuclear fusion of a
carbon-oxygen white dwarf. Details of the energetics are still not fully
modelled, but the end result is the ejection of the entire mass of the
original star with high kinetic energy. Around half a solar mass of this is
Ni₅₆ generated from silicon burning. Ni₅₆ is radioactive and generates Co₅₆
by beta plus decay with a half life of six days, plus gamma rays. Co₅₆
itself decays by the beta plus path with a half life of 77 days to stable
Fe₅₆. These two processes are responsible for the electromagnetic radiation
from type Ia supernovae. In combination with the changing transparency of
the ejected material, they produce the rapidly declining light curve.¹⁰⁰

Core collapse supernovae are on average visually fainter than type Ia
supernovae, but the total energy released is far higher. This is driven by
gravitational potential energy from the core collapse, initially producing
electron neutrinos from disintegrating nucleons, followed by all flavours
of thermal neutrinos from the super-heated neutron star core. Around 1% of
these neutrinos are thought to deposit sufficient energy into the outer
layers of the star to drive the resulting explosion, but again the details
cannot be reproduced exactly in current models. Kinetic energies and nickel
yields are somewhat lower than type Ia supernovae, hence the reduced visual
luminosity, but energy from the ionisation of the many solar masses of
remaining hydrogen can contribute to a much slower decline in luminosity
and produce the plateau phase seen in the majority of core collapse
supernovae.

In some core collapse supernovae, fallback onto a black hole drives
relativistic jets which may produce a brief energetic and directional burst
of gamma rays and also transfers substantial further energy into the
ejected material. This is one scenario for producing high luminosity
supernovae and is thought to be the cause of type Ic hypernovae and long
duration gamma-ray bursts. If the relativistic jets are too brief and fail
to penetrate the stellar envelope then a low luminosity gamma-ray burst may
be produced and the supernova may be sub-luminous.

When a supernova occurs inside a small dense cloud of circumstellar
material then it will produce a shock wave that can efficiently convert a
high fraction of the kinetic energy into electromagnetic radiation. Even
though the initial explosion energy was entirely normal the resulting
supernova will have high luminosity and extended duration since it does not
rely on exponential radioactive decay. This type of event may cause type
IIn hypernovae.

Although pair-instability supernovae are core collapse supernovae with
spectra and light curves similar to type II-P, the nature of the explosion
following core collapse is more like a giant type Ia with runaway fusion of
carbon, oxygen, and silicon. The total energy released by the highest mass
events is comparable to other core collapse supernovae but neutrino
production is thought to be very low, hence the kinetic and electromagnetic
energy is very high. The cores of these stars are much larger than any
white dwarf and the amount of radioactive nickel and other heavy elements
ejected can be orders of magnitude higher, with consequently high visual
luminosity.

Progenitor

The supernova classification type is closely tied to the type of star at
the time of the explosion. The occurrence of each type of supernova depends
dramatically on the metallicity and hence the age of the host galaxy.

Type Ia supernovae are produced from white dwarf stars in binary systems
and occur in all galaxy types. Core collapse supernovae are only found in
galaxies undergoing current or very recent star formation, since they
result from short-lived massive stars. They are most commonly found in type
Sc spirals, but also in the arms of other spiral galaxies and in irregular
galaxies, especially starburst galaxies.

Type Ib/c and II-L, and possibly most type IIn, supernovae are only thought
to be produced from stars having near-solar metallicity levels that result
in high mass loss from massive stars, hence they are less common in older
more distant galaxies. The table shows the expected progenitor for the main
types of core collapse supernova, and the approximate proportions of each
in the local neighbourhood.

There are a number of difficulties reconciling modelled and observed
stellar evolution leading up to core collapse supernovae. Red supergiants
are the expected progenitors for the vast majority of core collapse
supernovae, and these have been observed but only at relatively low masses
and luminosities, below about 18 M☉ and 100,000 L☉ respectively. Most
progenitors of type II supernovae are not detected and must be considerably
fainter, and presumably less massive. It is now proposed that higher mass
red supergiants do not explode as supernovae, but instead evolve back
towards hotter temperatures. Several progenitors of type IIb supernovae
have been confirmed, and these were K and G supergiants, plus one A
supergiant.¹⁰⁵ Yellow hypergiants or LBVs are proposed progenitors for type
IIb supernovae, and almost all type IIb supernovae near enough to observe
have shown such progenitors.¹⁰⁶ ¹⁰⁷

Until just a few decades ago, hot supergiants were not considered likely to
explode, but observations have shown otherwise. Blue supergiants form an
unexpectedly high proportion of confirmed supernova progenitors, partly due
to their high luminosity and easy detection, while not a single Wolf-Rayet
progenitor has yet been clearly identified.¹⁰⁵ ¹⁰⁸ Models have had
difficulty showing how blue supergiants lose enough mass to reach supernova
without progressing to a different evolutionary stage. One study has shown
a possible route for low-luminosity post-red supergiant luminous blue
variables to collapse, most likely as a type IIn supernova.¹⁰⁹

The expected progenitors of type Ib supernovae, luminous WC stars, are not
observed at all. Instead WC stars are found at lower luminosities,
apparently post-red supergiant stars. WO stars are extremely rare and
visually relatively faint, so it is difficult to say whether such
progenitors are missing or just yet to be observed. Very luminous
progenitors, despite numerous supernovae being observed near enough that
such progenitors would have been clearly imaged.¹⁰⁸ Several examples of hot
luminous progenitors of type IIn supernovae have been detected: SN 2005gy
and SN 2010jl were both apparently massive luminous stars, but are very
distant; and SN 2009ip had a highly luminous progenitor likely to have been
an LBV, but is a peculiar supernova whose exact nature is disupted.¹⁰⁵

Interstellar impact

Source of heavy elements

Main article: Supernova nucleosynthesis

Supernovae are a key source of elements heavier than oxygen.¹¹⁰ These
elements are produced by nuclear fusion (for iron-56 and lighter elements),
and by nucleosynthesis during the supernova explosion for elements heavier
than iron.¹¹¹ Supernovae are the most likely, although not undisputed,
candidate sites for the r-process, which is a rapid form of nucleosynthesis
that occurs under conditions of high temperature and high density of
neutrons. The reactions produce highly unstable nuclei that are rich in
neutrons. These forms are unstable and rapidly beta decay into more stable
forms.

The r-process reaction, which is likely to occur in type II supernovae,
produces about half of all the element abundance beyond iron, including
plutonium and uranium.¹¹² The only other major competing process for
producing elements heavier than iron is the s-process in large, old red
giant stars, which produces these elements much more slowly, and which
cannot produce elements heavier than lead.¹¹³

Role in stellar evolution

Main article: Supernova remnant

The remnant of a supernova explosion consists of a compact object and a
rapidly expanding shock wave of material. This cloud of material sweeps up
the surrounding interstellar medium during a free expansion phase, which
can last for up to two centuries. The wave then gradually undergoes a
period of adiabatic expansion, and will slowly cool and mix with the
surrounding interstellar medium over a period of about 10,000 years.¹¹⁴

The Big Bang produced hydrogen, helium, and traces of lithium, while all
heavier elements are synthesized in stars and supernovae. Supernovae tend
to enrich the surrounding interstellar medium with metals—elements other
than hydrogen and helium.

These injected elements ultimately enrich the molecular clouds that are the
sites of star formation.¹¹⁵ Thus, each stellar generation has a slightly
different composition, going from an almost pure mixture of hydrogen and
helium to a more metal-rich composition. Supernovae are the dominant
mechanism for distributing these heavier elements, which are formed in a
star during its period of nuclear fusion. The different abundances of
elements in the material that forms a star have important influences on the
star's life, and may decisively influence the possibility of having planets
orbiting it.

The kinetic energy of an expanding supernova remnant can trigger star
formation due to compression of nearby, dense molecular clouds in space.¹¹⁶
The increase in turbulent pressure can also prevent star formation if the
cloud is unable to lose the excess energy.¹⁰

Evidence from daughter products of short-lived radioactive isotopes shows
that a nearby supernova helped determine the composition of the Solar
System 4.5 billion years ago, and may even have triggered the formation of
this system.¹¹⁷ Supernova production of heavy elements over astronomic
periods of time ultimately made the chemistry of life on Earth possible.

Effect on Earth

Main article: Near-Earth supernova

A near-Earth supernova is a supernova close enough to the Earth to have
noticeable effects on its biosphere. Depending upon the type and energy of
the supernova, it could be as far as 3000 light-years away. Gamma rays from
a supernova would induce a chemical reaction in the upper atmosphere
converting molecular nitrogen into nitrogen oxides, depleting the ozone
layer enough to expose the surface to harmful solar radiation. This has
been proposed as the cause of the Ordovician–Silurian extinction, which
resulted in the death of nearly 60% of the oceanic life on Earth.¹¹⁸ In
1996 it was theorized that traces of past supernovae might be detectable on
Earth in the form of metal isotope signatures in rock strata. Iron-60
enrichment was later reported in deep-sea rock of the Pacific Ocean.¹¹⁹ ¹²⁰
¹²¹ In 2009, elevated levels of nitrate ions were found in Antarctic ice,
which coincided with the 1006 and 1054 supernovae. Gamma rays from these
supernovae could have boosted levels of nitrogen oxides, which became
trapped in the ice.¹²²

Type Ia supernovae are thought to be potentially the most dangerous if they
occur close enough to the Earth. Because these supernovae arise from dim,
common white dwarf stars, it is likely that a supernova that can affect the
Earth will occur unpredictably and in a star system that is not well
studied. The closest known candidate is IK Pegasi (see below).¹²³ Recent
estimates predict that a Type II supernova would have to be closer than
eight parsecs (26 light-years) to destroy half of the Earth's ozone
layer.¹²⁴

Milky Way candidates

Main article: List of supernova candidates

Several large stars within the Milky Way have been suggested as possible
supernovae within the next million years. These include Rho Cassiopeiae,¹²⁶
Eta Carinae,¹²⁷ RS Ophiuchi,¹²⁸ U Scorpii,¹²⁹ VY Canis Majoris,¹³⁰
Betelgeuse, and Antares.¹³¹ Many Wolf–Rayet stars, such as Gamma
Velorum,¹³² WR 104,¹³³ and those in the Quintuplet Cluster,¹³⁴ are also
considered possible precursor stars to a supernova explosion in the 'near'
future.

The nearest supernova candidate is IK Pegasi (HR 8210), located at a
distance of 150 light-years. This closely orbiting binary star system
consists of a main sequence star and a white dwarf 31 million kilometres
apart. The dwarf has an estimated mass 1.15 times that of the Sun.¹³⁵ It is
thought that several million years will pass before the white dwarf can
accrete the critical mass required to become a Type Ia supernova.¹³⁶

Notes

[1] The value is obtained by converting the suffix "nc" from bijective
  base-26, with a = 1, b = 2, c =3,  ... z = 26. Thus nc = n × 26 + c = 14
  × 26 + 3 = 367.
[2] For a core primarily composed of oxygen, neon and magnesium, the
  collapsing white dwarf will typically form a neutron star. In this case,
  only a fraction of the star's mass will be ejected during the collapse.

The Astrophysical Journal

The Astrophysical Journal, often abbreviated ApJ (pronounced "ap jay") in
references and speech,¹ is a peer-reviewed scientific journal of
astrophysics, established in 1895 by American astronomers George Ellery
Hale and James Edward Keeler. As of 2013 it published three 900-page issues
per month.

Since 1953 The Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series (ApJS) has been
published in conjunction with The Astrophysical Journal, with generally
longer articles to supplement the material in the journal. It publishes six
volumes per year, with two 280-page issues per volume.

The Astrophysical Journal Letters (ApJL) is another section of The
Astrophysical Journal which rapidly publishes short communications.

The journal and the supplement series were both published by the University
of Chicago Press for the American Astronomical Society until, in January
2009, publication was transferred to IOP Publishing,² following the move of
the society's Astronomical Journal in 2008. The reason for the changes were
given by the society as the increasing financial demands of the University
of Chicago Press.³ Much information on the history of ApJ up to 1995 was
published in an article entitled Some Statistical Highlights of the
Astrophysical Journal in 1995.⁴

Universe

For other uses, see Universe (disambiguation).

The Universe is all of time and space and its contents.⁸ ⁹ ¹⁰ ¹¹ The
Universe includes planets, stars, galaxies, the contents of intergalactic
space, the smallest subatomic particles, and all matter and energy. The
observable universe is about 28 billion parsecs (91 billion light-years) in
diameter at the present time.² The size of the whole Universe is not known
and may be infinite.¹² Observations and the development of physical
theories have led to inferences about the composition and evolution of the
Universe.

Throughout recorded history, cosmologies and cosmogonies, including
scientific models, have been proposed to explain observations of the
Universe. The earliest quantitative geocentric models were developed by
ancient Greek philosophers and Indian philosophers.¹³ ¹⁴ Over the
centuries, more precise astronomical observations led to Nicolaus
Copernicus's heliocentric model of the Solar System and Johannes Kepler's
improvement on that model with elliptical orbits, which was eventually
explained by Isaac Newton's theory of gravity. Further observational
improvements led to the realization that the Solar System is located in a
galaxy composed of billions of stars, the Milky Way. It was subsequently
discovered that our galaxy is just one of many. On the largest scales, it
is assumed that the distribution of galaxies is uniform and the same in all
directions, meaning that the Universe has neither an edge nor a center.
Observations of the distribution of these galaxies and their spectral lines
have led to many of the theories of modern physical cosmology. The
discovery in the early 20th century that galaxies are systematically
redshifted suggested that the Universe is expanding, and the discovery of
the cosmic microwave background radiation suggested that the Universe had a
beginning.¹⁵ Finally, observations in the late 1990s indicated the rate of
the expansion of the Universe is increasing¹⁶ indicating that the majority
of energy is most likely in an unknown form called dark energy. The
majority of mass in the universe also appears to exist in an unknown form,
called dark matter.

The Big Bang theory is the prevailing cosmological model describing the
development of the Universe. Space and time were created in the Big Bang,
and these were imbued with a fixed amount of energy and matter; as space
expands, the density of that matter and energy decreases. After the initial
expansion, the Universe cooled sufficiently to allow the formation first of
subatomic particles and later of simple atoms. Giant clouds of these
primordial elements later coalesced through gravity to form stars. Assuming
that the prevailing model is correct, the age of the Universe is measured
to be 13.799±0.021 billion years.¹

There are many competing hypotheses about the ultimate fate of the
Universe. Physicists and philosophers remain unsure about what, if
anything, preceded the Big Bang. Many refuse to speculate, doubting that
any information from any such prior state could ever be accessible. There
are various multiverse hypotheses, in which some physicists have suggested
that the Universe might be one among many universes that likewise exist.¹⁷
¹⁸

Definition

The Universe is customarily defined as everything that exists, everything
that has existed, and everything that will exist.¹⁹ ²⁰ ²¹ According to our
current understanding, the Universe consists of three constituents:
spacetime, forms of energy (including electromagnetic radiation and
matter), and the physical laws that relate them. The Universe also
encompasses all of life, all of history, and some philosophers and
scientists even suggest that it encompasses ideas such as mathematics.²² ²³
²⁴

Etymology

The word universe derives from the Old French word univers, which in turn
derives from the Latin word universum.²⁵ The Latin word was used by Cicero
and later Latin authors in many of the same senses as the modern English
word is used.²⁶

Synonyms

A term for "universe" among the ancient Greek philosophers from Pythagoras
onwards was τὸ πᾶν tò pân ("the all"), defined as all matter and all space,
and τὸ ὅλον tò hólon ("all things"), which did not necessarily include the
void.²⁷ ²⁸ Another synonym was ὁ κόσμος ho kósmos (meaning the world, the
cosmos).²⁹ Synonyms are also found in Latin authors (totum, mundus,
natura)³⁰ and survive in modern languages, e.g., the German words Das All,
Weltall, and Natur for Universe. The same synonyms are found in English,
such as everything (as in the theory of everything), the cosmos (as in
cosmology), the world (as in the many-worlds interpretation), and nature
(as in natural laws or natural philosophy).³¹

Chronology and the Big Bang

Main articles: Big Bang and Chronology of the Universe

The prevailing model for the evolution of the Universe is the Big Bang
theory.³² ³³ The Big Bang model states that the earliest state of the
Universe was extremely hot and dense and that it subsequently expanded. The
model is based on general relativity and on simplifying assumptions such as
homogeneity and isotropy of space. A version of the model with a
cosmological constant (Lambda) and cold dark matter, known as the
Lambda-CDM model, is the simplest model that provides a reasonably good
account of various observations about the Universe. The Big Bang model
accounts for observations such as the correlation of distance and redshift
of galaxies, the ratio of the number of hydrogen to helium atoms, and the
microwave radiation background.

The initial hot, dense state is called the Planck epoch, a brief period
extending from time zero to one Planck time unit of approximately 10−43
seconds. During the Planck epoch, all types of matter and all types of
energy were concentrated into a dense state, where gravitation is believed
to have been as strong as the other fundamental forces, and all the forces
may have been unified. Since the Planck epoch, the Universe has been
expanding to its present form, possibly with a very brief period of cosmic
inflation which caused the Universe to reach a much larger size in less
than 10−32 seconds.³⁴

After the Planck epoch and inflation came the quark, hadron, and lepton
epochs. Together, these epochs encompassd less than 10 seconds of time
following the Big Bang. The observed abundance of the elements can be
explained by combining the overall expansion of space with nuclear and
atomic physics. As the Universe expands, the energy density of
electromagnetic radiation decreases more quickly than does that of matter
because the energy of a photon decreases with its wavelength. As the
Universe expanded and cooled, elementary particles associated stably into
ever larger combinations. Thus, in the early part of the matter-dominated
era, stable protons and neutrons formed, which then formed atomic nuclei
through nuclear reactions. This process, known as Big Bang nucleosynthesis,
led to the present abundances of lighter nuclei, particularly hydrogen,
deuterium, and helium. Big Bang nucleosynthesis ended about 20 minutes
after the Big Bang, when the Universe had cooled enough so that nuclear
fusion could no longer occur. At this stage, matter in the Universe was
mainly a hot, dense plasma of negatively charged electrons, neutral
neutrinos and positive nuclei. This era, called the photon epoch, lasted
about 380 thousand years.

Eventually, at time known as recombination, electrons and nuclei formed
stable atoms, which are transparent to most wavelengths of radiation. With
photons decoupled from matter, the Universe entered the matter-dominated
era. Light from this era could now travel freely, and it can still be seen
in the Universe as the cosmic microwave background (CMB). After around 100
million years, the first stars formed; these were likely very massive,
luminous, and responsible for the reionization of the Universe. Having no
elements heavier than lithium, these stars also produced the first heavy
elements through stellar nucleosynthesis.³⁵ The Universe also contains a
mysterious energy called dark energy; the energy density of dark energy
does not change over time. After about 9.8 billion years, the Universe had
expanded sufficiently so that the density of matter was less than the
density of dark energy, marking the beginning of the present
dark-energy-dominated era.³⁶ In this era, the expansion of the Universe is
accelerating due to dark energy.

Properties

Main articles: Observable universe, Age of the Universe and Metric
expansion of space

The spacetime of the Universe is usually interpreted from a Euclidean
perspective, with space as consisting of three dimensions, and time as
consisting of one dimension, the "fourth dimension".³⁷ By combining space
and time into a single manifold called Minkowski space, physicists have
simplified a large number of physical theories, as well as described in a
more uniform way the workings of the Universe at both the supergalactic and
subatomic levels.

Spacetime events are not absolutely defined spatially and temporally but
rather are known relative to the motion of an observer. Minkowski space
approximates the Universe without gravity; the pseudo-Riemannian manifolds
of general relativity describe spacetime with matter and gravity. String
theory postulates the existence of additional dimensions.

Of the four fundamental interactions, gravitation is dominant at
cosmological length scales, including galaxies and larger-scale structures.
Gravity's effects are cumulative; by contrast, the effects of positive and
negative charges tend to cancel one another, making electromagnetism
relatively insignificant on cosmological length scales. The remaining two
interactions, the weak and strong nuclear forces, decline very rapidly with
distance; their effects are confined mainly to sub-atomic length scales.

The Universe appears to have much more matter than antimatter, an asymmetry
possibly related to the observations of CP violation.³⁸ The Universe also
appears to have neither net momentum nor angular momentum. The absence of
net charge and momentum would follow from accepted physical laws (Gauss's
law and the non-divergence of the stress-energy-momentum pseudotensor,
respectively) if the Universe were finite.³⁹

Shape

Main article: Shape of the Universe

General relativity describes how spacetime is curved and bent by mass and
energy. The topology or geometry of the Universe includes both local
geometry in the observable universe and global geometry. Cosmologists often
work with a given space-like slice of spacetime called the comoving
coordinates. The section of spacetime which can be observed is the backward
light cone, which delimits the cosmological horizon. The cosmological
horizon (also called the particle horizon or the light horizon) is the
maximum distance from which particles can have traveled to the observer in
the age of the Universe. This horizon represents the boundary between the
observable and the unobservable regions of the Universe.⁴⁰ ⁴¹ The
existence, properties, and significance of a cosmological horizon depend on
the particular cosmological model.

An important parameter determining the future evolution of the Universe
theory is the density parameter, Omega (Ω), defined as the average matter
density of the universe divided by a critical value of that density. This
selects one of three possible geometries depending on whether Ω is equal
to, less than, or greater than 1. These are called, respectively, the flat,
open and closed universes.⁴²

Observations, including the Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE), Wilkinson
Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP), and Planck maps of the CMB, suggest that
the Universe is infinite in extent with a finite age, as described by the
Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker (FLRW) models.⁴³ ⁴⁴ ⁴⁵ ⁴⁶ These FLRW
models thus support inflationary models and the standard model of
cosmology, describing a flat, homogeneous universe presently dominated by
dark matter and dark energy.⁴⁷ ⁴⁸

Size and regions

See also: Observable universe and Observational cosmology

The size of the Universe is somewhat difficult to define. According to a
restrictive definition, the Universe is everything within our connected
spacetime that could have a chance to interact with us and vice versa.⁴⁹
According to the general theory of relativity, some regions of space may
never interact with ours even in the lifetime of the Universe due to the
finite speed of light and the ongoing expansion of space. For example,
radio messages sent from Earth may never reach some regions of space, even
if the Universe were to exist forever: space may expand faster than light
can traverse it.⁵⁰

Distant regions of space are assumed to exist and be part of reality as
much as we are even though we can never interact with them. The spatial
region which we can affect and be affected by is the observable universe.
The observable universe depends on the location of the observer. By
traveling, an observer can come into contact with a greater region of
spacetime than an observer who remains still. Nevertheless, even the most
rapid traveler will not be able to interact with all of space. Typically,
the observable universe is taken to mean the portion of the Universe which
is observable from our vantage point in the Milky Way Galaxy.

The proper distance – the distance as would be measured at a specific time,
including the present – between Earth and the edge of the observable
universe is 46 billion light-years (14×10⁹ pc)(pc=parsec) making the
diameter of the observable universe about 91 billion light-years (28×10⁹
pc). The distance the light from the edge of the observable universe has
travelled is very close to the age of the Universe times the speed of
light, 13.8 billion light-years (4.2×10⁹ pc), but this does not represent
the distance at any given time because the edge of the universe and the
Earth have moved since further apart.⁵¹ For comparison, the diameter of a
typical galaxy is 30,000 light-years, and the typical distance between two
neighboring galaxies is 3 million light-years.⁵² As an example, the Milky
Way Galaxy is roughly 100,000 light years in diameter,⁵³ and the nearest
sister galaxy to the Milky Way, the Andromeda Galaxy, is located roughly
2.5 million light years away.⁵⁴ Since we cannot observe space beyond the
edge of the observable universe, it is unknown whether the size of the
Universe is finite or infinite.¹² ⁵⁵ ⁵⁶

Age and expansion

Main articles: Age of the universe and Metric expansion of space

Astronomers calculate the age of the Universe by assuming that the
Lambda-CDM model accurately describes the evolution of the Universe from a
very uniform, hot, dense primordial state to its present state and
measuring the cosmological parameters which constitute the model. This
model is well understood theoretically and supported by recent
high-precision astronomical observations such as WMAP and Planck. Commonly,
the set of observations fitted includes the cosmic microwave background
anisotropy, the brightness/redshift relation for Type Ia supernovae, and
large-scale galaxy clustering including the baryon acoustic oscillation
feature. Other observations, such as the Hubble constant, the abundance of
galaxy clusters, weak gravitational lensing and globular cluster ages, are
generally consistent with these, providing a check of the model, but are
less accurately measured at present. With the prior that the Lambda-CDM
model is correct, the measurements of the parameters using a variety of
techniques by numerous experiments yield a best value of the age of the
Universe as of 2015 of 13.799 ± 0.021 billion years.¹

Over time, the Universe and its contents have evolved; for example, the
relative population of quasars and galaxies has changed⁵⁷ and space itself
has expanded. Due to this expansion, scientists on Earth can observe the
light from a galaxy 30 billion light years away even though that light has
traveled for only 13 billion years; the very space between them has
expanded. This expansion is consistent with the observation that the light
from distant galaxies has been redshifted; the photons emitted have been
stretched to longer wavelengths and lower frequency during their journey.
Analyses of Type Ia supernovae indicate that the spatial expansion is
accelerating.⁵⁸ ⁵⁹

The more matter there is in the Universe, the stronger the mutual
gravitational pull of the matter. If the Universe were too dense then it
would re-collapse into a gravitational singularity. However, if the
Universe contained too little matter then the expansion would accelerate
too rapidly for planets and planetary systems to form. Since the Big Bang,
the universe has expanded monotonically. Surprisingly, our universe has
just the right mass density of about 5 protons per cubic meter which has
allowed it to expand for last 13.8 billion years, giving time to form the
universe as observed today.⁶⁰

There are dynamical forces acting on the particles in the Universe which
affect the expansion rate. Before 1998, it was expected that the rate of
increase of the Hubble Constant would be decreasing as time went on due to
the influence of gravitational interactions in the Universe, and thus there
is an additional observable quantity in the Universe called the
deceleration parameter which cosmologists expected to be directly related
to the matter density of the Universe. In 1998, the deceleration parameter
was measured by two different groups to be consistent with −1 but not zero,
which implied that the present-day rate of increase of the Hubble Constant
is increasing over time.⁶¹ ¹⁶

Spacetime

Main articles: Spacetime and World line
See also: Lorentz transformation

Spacetimes are the arenas in which all physical events take place—an event
is a point in spacetime specified by its time and place. The basic elements
of spacetime are events. In any given spacetime, an event is a unique
position at a unique time. Because events are spacetime points, an example
of an event in classical relativistic physics is (x,y,z,t), the location of
an elementary (point-like) particle at a particular time. A spacetime is
the union of all events in the same way that a line is the union of all of
its points, formally organized into a manifold.

The Universe appears to be a smooth spacetime continuum consisting of three
spatial dimensions and one temporal (time) dimension. On the average, space
is observed to be very nearly flat (close to zero curvature), meaning that
Euclidean geometry is empirically true with high accuracy throughout most
of the Universe.⁶² Spacetime also appears to have a simply connected
topology, in analogy with a sphere, at least on the length-scale of the
observable Universe. However, present observations cannot exclude the
possibilities that the Universe has more dimensions and that its spacetime
may have a multiply connected global topology, in analogy with the
cylindrical or toroidal topologies of two-dimensional spaces.⁴⁴ ⁶³

The Universe is composed almost completely of dark energy, dark matter, and
ordinary matter. Other contents are electromagnetic radiation (estimated to
be from 0.005% to close to 0.01%) and antimatter.⁶⁴ ⁶⁵ ⁶⁶ The total amount
of electromagnetic radiation generated within the universe has decreased by
1/2 in the past 2 billion years.⁶⁷ ⁶⁸

Ordinary matter, which includes atoms, stars, galaxies, and life, accounts
for only 4.9% of the contents of the Universe.⁶ The present overall density
of this type of matter is very low, roughly 4.5 × 10−31 grams per cubic
centimetre, corresponding to a density of the order of only one proton for
every four cubic meters of volume.⁴ The nature of both dark energy and dark
matter is unknown. Dark matter, a mysterious form of matter that has not
yet been identified, accounts for 26.8% of the contents. Dark energy, which
is the energy of empty space and that is causing the expansion of the
Universe to accelerate, accounts for the remaining 68.3% of the contents.⁶⁹
⁷⁰ ⁶

Matter, dark matter, and dark energy are distributed homogeneously
throughout the Universe over length scales longer than 300 million
light-years or so.⁷¹ However, over shorter length-scales, matter tends to
clump hierarchically; many atoms are condensed into stars, most stars into
galaxies, most galaxies into clusters, superclusters and, finally,
large-scale galactic filaments. The observable Universe contains
approximately 300 sextillion (3×10²³) stars⁷² and more than 100 billion
(10¹¹) galaxies.⁷³ Typical galaxies range from dwarfs with as few as ten
million⁷⁴ (10⁷) stars up to giants with one trillion⁷⁵ (10¹²) stars.
Between the structures are voids, which are typically 10–150 Mpc (33
million–490 million ly) in diameter. The Milky Way is in the Local Group of
galaxies, which in turn is in the Laniakea Supercluster.⁷⁶ This
supercluster spans over 500 million light years, while the Local Group
spans over 10 million light years.⁷⁷ The Universe also has vast regions of
relative emptiness, the largest known void measures 1.8 billion ly (550
Mpc) across.⁷⁸

The observable Universe is isotropic on scales significantly larger than
superclusters, meaning that the statistical properties of the Universe are
the same in all directions as observed from Earth. The Universe is bathed
in highly isotropic microwave radiation that corresponds to a thermal
equilibrium blackbody spectrum of roughly 2.72548 kelvin.⁵ The hypothesis
that the large-scale Universe is homogeneous and isotropic is known as the
cosmological principle.⁸⁰ A Universe that is both homogeneous and isotropic
looks the same from all vantage points⁸¹ and has no center.⁸²

Dark energy

Main article: Dark energy

An explanation for why the expansion of the Universe is accelerating
remains elusive. It is often attributed to "dark energy", an unknown form
of energy that is hypothesized to permeate space.⁷⁰ On a mass–energy
equivalence basis, the density of dark energy (6.91 × 10−27 kg/m³) is much
less than the density of ordinary matter or dark matter within galaxies.
However, in the present dark-energy era, it dominates the mass–energy of
the universe because it is uniform across space.⁸³

Two proposed forms for dark energy are the cosmological constant, a
constant energy density filling space homogeneously,⁸⁴ and scalar fields
such as quintessence or moduli, dynamic quantities whose energy density can
vary in time and space. Contributions from scalar fields that are constant
in space are usually also included in the cosmological constant. The
cosmological constant can be formulated to be equivalent to vacuum energy.
Scalar fields having only a slight amont of spatial inhomogeneity would be
difficult to distinguish from a cosmological constant.

Dark matter

Main article: Dark matter

Dark matter is a hypothetical kind of matter that cannot be seen with
telescopes, but which accounts for most of the matter in the Universe. The
existence and properties of dark matter are inferred from its gravitational
effects on visible matter, radiation, and the large-scale structure of the
Universe. Other than neutrinos, a form of hot dark matter, dark matter has
not been detected directly, making it one of the greatest mysteries in
modern astrophysics. Dark matter neither emits nor absorbs light or any
other electromagnetic radiation at any significant level. Dark matter is
estimated to constitute 26.8% of the total mass–energy and 84.5% of the
total matter in the Universe.⁶⁹ ⁸⁵

Ordinary Matter

Main article: Matter

The remaining 4.9% of the mass–energy of the Universe is ordinary matter,
that is, atoms, ions, electrons and the objects they form. This matter
includes stars, which produce nearly all of the light we see from galaxies,
as well as interstellar gas in the interstellar and intergalactic media,
planets, and all the objects from everyday life that we can bump into,
touch or squeeze.⁸⁶ Ordinary matter commonly exists in four states (or
phases): solid, liquid and gas, and plasma. However, advances in
experimental techniques have revealed other previously theoretical phases,
such as Bose–Einstein condensates and fermionic condensates.

Ordinary matter is composed of two types of elementary particles: quarks
and leptons.⁸⁷ For example, the proton is formed of two up quarks and one
down quark; the neutron is formed of two down quarks and one up quark; and
the electron is a kind of lepton. An atom consists of an atomic nucleus,
made up of protons and neutrons, and electrons that orbit the nucleus.
Because most of the mass of an atom is concentrated in its nucleus, which
is made up of baryons, astronomers often use the term baryonic matter to
describe ordinary matter, although a small fraction of this "baryonic
matter" is electrons.

Soon after the Big Bang, primordial protons and neutrons formed from the
quark–gluon plasma of the early Universe as it cooled below two trillion
degrees. A few minutes later, in a process known as Big Bang
nucleosynthesis, nuclei formed from the primordial protons and neutrons.
This nucleosynthesis formed lighter elements, those with small atomic
numbers up to lithium and beryllium, but the abundance of heavier elements
dropped off sharply with increasing atomic number. Some boron may have been
formed at this time, but the next heavier element, carbon, was not be
formed in significant amounts. Big Bang nucleosynthesis shut down after
about 20 minutes due to the rapid drop in temperature and density of the
expanding Universe. Subsequent formation of heavier elements resulted from
stellar nucleosynthesis and supernova nucleosynthesis.⁸⁸

Particles

Main article: Particle physics

Ordinary matter and the forces that act on matter can be described in terms
of elementary particles.⁸⁹ These particles are sometimes described as being
fundamental, since they have an unknown substructure, and it is unknown
whether or not they are composed of smaller and even more fundamental
particles.⁹⁰ ⁹¹ Of central importance is the Standard Model, a theory that
is concerned with electromagnetic interactions and the weak and strong
nuclear interactions.⁹² The Standard Model is supported by the experimental
confirmation of the existence of particles that compose matter: quarks and
leptons, and their corresponding "antimatter" duals, as well as the force
particles that mediate interactions: the photon, the W and Z bosons, and
the gluon.⁹⁰ The Standard Model predicted the existence of the recently
discovered Higgs boson, a particle that is a manifestation of a field
within the Universe that can endow particles with mass.⁹³ ⁹⁴ Because of its
success in explaining a wide variety of experimental results, the Standard
Model is sometimes regarded as a "theory of almost everything".⁹² The
Standard Model does not, however, accommodate gravity. A true
force-particle "theory of everything" has not been attained.⁹⁵

Hadrons

Main article: Hadron

A hadron is a composite particle made of quarks held together by the strong
force. Hadrons are categorized into two families: baryons (such as protons
and neutrons) made of three quarks, and mesons (such as pions) made of one
quark and one antiquark. Of the hadrons, protons are stable, and neutrons
bound within atomic nuclei are stable. Other hadrons are unstable under
ordinary conditions and are thus insignificant constituents of the modern
Universe. From approximately 10−6 seconds after the Big Bang, during a
period is known as the hadron epoch, the temperature of the universe had
fallen sufficiently to allow quarks to bind together into hadrons, and the
mass of the Universe was dominated by hadrons. Initially the temperature
was high enough to allow the formation of hadron/anti-hadron pairs, which
kept matter and antimatter in thermal equilibrium. However, as the
temperature of the Universe continued to fall, hadron/anti-hadron pairs
were no longer produced. Most of the hadrons and anti-hadrons were then
eliminated in particle-antiparticle annihilation reactions, leaving a small
residual of hadrons by the time the Universe was about one second old.⁹⁶
:244–266

Leptons

Main article: Lepton

A lepton is an elementary, half-integer spin particle that does not undergo
strong interactions but is subject to the Pauli exclusion principle; no two
leptons of the same species can be in exactly the same state at the same
time.⁹⁷ Two main classes of leptons exist: charged leptons (also known as
the electron-like leptons), and neutral leptons (better known as
neutrinos). Electrons are stable and the most common charged lepton in the
Universe, whereas muons and taus are unstable particle that quickly decay
after being produced in high energy collisions, such as those involving
cosmic rays or carried out in particle accelerators.⁹⁸ ⁹⁹ Charged leptons
can combine with other particles to form various composite particles such
as atoms and positronium. The electron governs nearly all of chemistry, as
it is found in atoms and is directly tied to all chemical properties.
Neutrinos rarely interact with anything, and are consequently rarely
observed. Neutrinos stream throughout the Universe but rarely interact with
normal matter.¹⁰⁰

The lepton epoch was the period in the evolution of the early Universe in
which the leptons dominated the mass of the Universe. It started roughly 1
second after the Big Bang, after the majority of hadrons and anti-hadrons
annihilated each other at the end of the hadron epoch. During the lepton
epoch the temperature of the Universe was still high enough to create
lepton/anti-lepton pairs, so leptons and anti-leptons were in thermal
equilibrium. Approximately 10 seconds after the Big Bang, the temperature
of the Universe had fallen to the point where lepton/anti-lepton pairs were
no longer created.¹⁰¹ Most leptons and anti-leptons were then eliminated in
annihilation reactions, leaving a small residue of leptons. The mass of the
Universe was then dominated by photons as it entered the following photon
epoch.

Photons

Main article: Photon epoch
See also: Photino

A photon is the quantum of light and all other forms of electromagnetic
radiation. It is the force carrier for the electromagnetic force, even when
static via virtual photons. The effects of this force are easily observable
at the microscopic and at the macroscopic level because the photon has zero
rest mass; this allows long distance interactions. Like all elementary
particles, photons are currently best explained by quantum mechanics and
exhibit wave–particle duality, exhibiting properties of waves and of
particles.

The photon epoch started after most leptons and anti-leptons were
annihilated at the end of the lepton epoch, about 10 seconds after the Big
Bang. Atomic nuclei were created in the process of nucleosynthesis which
occurred during the first few minutes of the photon epoch. For the
remainder of the photon epoch the Universe contained a hot dense plasma of
nuclei, electrons and photons. About 380,000 years after the Big Bang, the
temperature of the Universe fell to the point where nuclei could combine
with electrons to create neutral atoms. As a result, photons no longer
interacted frequently with matter and the Universe became transparent. The
highly redshifted photons from this period form the cosmic microwave
background. Tiny variations in temperature and density detectable in the
CMB were the early "seeds" from which all subsequent structure formation
took place.⁹⁶ :244–266

Cosmological models

Model of the Universe based on general relativity

Main article: Solutions of the Einstein field equations
See also: Big Bang and Ultimate fate of the Universe

General relativity is the geometric theory of gravitation published by
Albert Einstein in 1915 and the current description of gravitation in
modern physics. It is the basis of current cosmological models of the
Universe. General relativity generalizes special relativity and Newton's
law of universal gravitation, providing a unified description of gravity as
a geometric property of space and time, or spacetime. In particular, the
curvature of spacetime is directly related to the energy and momentum of
whatever matter and radiation are present. The relation is specified by the
Einstein field equations, a system of partial differential equations. In
general relativity, the distribution of matter and energy determines the
geometry of spacetime, which in turn describes the acceleration of matter.
Therefore, solutions of the Einstein field equations describe the evolution
of the Universe. Combined with measurements of the amount, type, and
distribution of matter in the Universe, the equations of general relativity
describe the evolution of the Universe over time.¹⁰²

With the assumption of the cosmological principle that the Universe is
homogeneous and isotropic everywhere, a specific solution of the field
equations that describes the Universe is the metric tensor called the
Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric,

ds^2 = -c^{2} dt^2 + R(t)^2 \left ( \frac{dr²}{1-k r²} + r^2 dθ^2 + r^2
\sin ^2 θ dϕ^2 \right )

where (r, θ, φ) correspond to a spherical coordinate system. This metric
has only two undetermined parameters. An overall dimensionless length scale
factor R describes the size scale of the Universe as a function of time; an
increase in R is the expansion of the Universe.¹⁰³ A curvature index k
describes the geometry. The index k is defined so that it can be only 0,
corresponding to flat Euclidean geometry, 1, corresponding to a space of
positive curvature, or −1, a space of positive or negative curvature.¹⁰⁴
The value of R as a function of time t and depends upon k and the
cosmological constant Λ.¹⁰² The cosmological constant represents the energy
density of the vacuum of space and could be related to dark energy.⁷⁰ The
equation describing how R varies with time is known as the Friedmann
equation after its inventor, Alexander Friedmann.¹⁰⁵

The solutions for R(t) depend on k and Λ, but some qualitative features of
such solutions are general. First and most importantly, the length scale R
of the Universe can remain constant only if the Universe is perfectly
isotropic with positive curvature (k=1) and has one precise value of
density everywhere, as first noted by Albert Einstein.¹⁰² However, this
equilibrium is unstable: because the Universe is known to be inhomogeneous
on smaller scales, R must change over time. When R changes, all the spatial
distances in the Universe change in tandem; there is an overall expansion
or contraction of space itself. This accounts for the observation that
galaxies appear to be flying apart; the space between them is stretching.
The stretching of space also accounts for the apparent paradox that two
galaxies can be 40 billion light years apart, although they started from
the same point 13.8 billion years ago¹⁰⁶ and never moved faster than the
speed of light.

Second, all solutions suggest that there was a gravitational singularity in
the past, when R went to zero and matter and energy were infinitely dense.
It may seem that this conclusion is uncertain because it is based on the
questionable assumptions of perfect homogeneity and isotropy (the
cosmological principle) and that only the gravitational interaction is
significant. However, the Penrose–Hawking singularity theorems show that a
singularity should exist for very general conditions. Hence, according to
Einstein's field equations, R grew rapidly from an unimaginably hot, dense
state that existed immediately following this singularity (when R had a
small, finite value); this is the essence of the Big Bang model of the
Universe. Understanding the singularity of the Big Bang likely requires a
quantum theory of gravity, which does not yet exist.¹⁰⁷

Third, the curvature index k determines the sign of the mean spatial
curvature of spacetime¹⁰⁴ averaged over sufficiently large length scales
(greater than about a billion light years). If k=1, the curvature is
positive and the Universe has a finite volume.¹⁰⁸ Such universes are often
visualized as a three-dimensional sphere 3-sphere embedded in a
four-dimensional space. Conversely, if k is zero or negative, the Universe
has infinite volume.¹⁰⁸ It may seem counter-intuitive that an infinite and
yet infinitely dense Universe could be created in a single instant at the
Big Bang when R=0, but exactly that is predicted mathematically when k does
not equal 1. By analogy, an infinite plane has zero curvature but infinite
area, whereas an infinite cylinder is finite in one direction and a torus
is finite in both. A toroidal Universe could behave like a normal Universe
with periodic boundary conditions.

The ultimate fate of the Universe is still unknown, because it depends
critically on the curvature index k and the cosmological constant Λ. If the
Universe were sufficiently dense, k would equal +1, meaning that its
average curvature throughout is positive and the Universe will eventually
recollapse in a Big Crunch,¹⁰⁹ possibly starting a new Universe in a Big
Bounce. Conversely, if the Universe were insufficiently dense, k would
equal 0 or −1 and the Universe would expand forever, cooling off and
eventually reaching the Big Freeze and the heat death of the Universe.¹⁰²
Modern data suggests that the expansion speed of the Universe is not
decreasing as originally expected, but increasing; if this continues
indefinitely, the Universe may eventually reach a Big Rip. Observationally,
the Universe appears to be flat (k = 0), with an overall density that is
very close to the critical value between recollapse and eternal
expansion.¹¹⁰

Multiverse hypothesis

Main articles: Multiverse, Many-worlds interpretation, Bubble universe
theory and Parallel universe (fiction)
See also: Eternal inflation

Some speculative theories have proposed that our Universe is but one of a
set of disconnected universes, collectively denoted as the multiverse,
challenging or enhancing more limited definitions of the Universe.¹⁷ ¹¹¹
Scientific multiverse models are distinct from concepts such as alternate
planes of consciousness and simulated reality.

Max Tegmark developed a four-part classification scheme for the different
types of multiverses that scientists have suggested in various problem
domains. An example of such a model is the chaotic inflation model of the
early universe.¹¹² Another is the many-worlds interpretation of quantum
mechanics. Parallel worlds are generated in a manner similar to quantum
superposition and decoherence, with all states of the wave function being
realized in separate worlds. Effectively, the multiverse evolves as a
universal wavefunction. If the Big Bang that created our multiverse created
an ensemble of multiverses, the wave function of the ensemble would be
entangled in this sense.¹¹³

The least controversial category of multiverse in Tegmark's scheme is Level
I, which describes distant spacetime events "in our own universe", but
suggests that statistical analysis exploiting the anthropic principle
provides an opportunity to test multiverse theories in some cases. If space
is infinite, or sufficiently large and uniform, identical instances of the
history of Earth's entire Hubble volume occur every so often, simply by
chance. Tegmark calculated our nearest so-called doppelgänger, is 1010¹¹⁵
meters away from us (a double exponential function larger than a
googolplex).¹¹⁴ ¹¹⁵ In principle, it would be impossible to scientifically
verify an identical Hubble volume. However, it does follow as a fairly
straightforward consequence from otherwise unrelated scientific
observations and theories.

It is possible to conceive of disconnected spacetimes, each existing but
unable to interact with one another.¹¹⁴ ¹¹⁶ An easily visualized metaphor
is a group of separate soap bubbles, in which observers living on one soap
bubble cannot interact with those on other soap bubbles, even in
principle.¹¹⁷ According to one common terminology, each "soap bubble" of
spacetime is denoted as a universe, whereas our particular spacetime is
denoted as the Universe,¹⁷ just as we call our moon the Moon. The entire
collection of these separate spacetimes is denoted as the multiverse.¹⁷
With this terminology, different Universes are not causally connected to
each other.¹⁷ In principle, the other unconnected Universes may have
different dimensionalities and topologies of spacetime, different forms of
matter and energy, and different physical laws and physical constants,
although such possibilities are purely speculative.¹⁷ Others consider each
of several bubbles created as part of chaotic inflation to be separate
Universes, though in this model these universes all share a causal
origin.¹⁷

Fine-tuned Universe

Main article: Fine-tuned Universe

The fine-tuned Universe is the proposition that the conditions that allow
life in the Universe can only occur when certain universal fundamental
physical constants lie within a very narrow range, so that if any of
several fundamental constants were only slightly different, the Universe
would be unlikely to be conducive to the establishment and development of
matter, astronomical structures, elemental diversity, or life as it is
understood.¹¹⁸ The proposition is discussed among philosophers, scientists,
theologians, and proponents and detractors of creationism.

Historical development

Copernican system and Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica §
Beginnings of the Scientific Revolution

Historically, there have been many ideas of the cosmos (cosmologies) and
its origin (cosmogonies). Theories of an impersonal Universe governed by
physical laws were first proposed by the Greeks and Indians.¹⁴ Ancient
Chinese philosophy encompassed the notion of the Universe including both
all of space and all of time.¹¹⁹ ¹²⁰ Over the centuries, improvements in
astronomical observations and theories of motion and gravitation led to
ever more accurate descriptions of the Universe. The modern era of
cosmology began with Albert Einstein's 1915 general theory of relativity,
which made it possible to quantitatively predict the origin, evolution, and
conclusion of the Universe as a whole. Most modern, accepted theories of
cosmology are based on general relativity and, more specifically, the
predicted Big Bang.¹²¹

Mythologies

Main articles: Creation myth, Creator deity and Religious cosmology

Many cultures have stories describing the origin of the world and universe.
Cultures generally regard these stories as having some truth. There are
however many differing beliefs in how these stories apply amongst those
believing in a supernatural origin, ranging from a god directly creating
the Universe as it is now to a god just setting the "wheels in motion" (for
example via mechanisms such as the big bang and evolution).¹²²

Ethnologists and anthropologists who study myths have developed various
classification schemes for the various themes that appear in creation
stories.¹²³ ¹²⁴ For example, in one type of story, the world is born from a
world egg; such stories include the Finnish epic poem Kalevala, the Chinese
story of Pangu or the Indian Brahmanda Purana. In related stories, the
Universe is created by a single entity emanating or producing something by
him- or herself, as in the Tibetan Buddhism concept of Adi-Buddha, the
ancient Greek story of Gaia (Mother Earth), the Aztec goddess Coatlicue
myth, the ancient Egyptian god Atum story, and the Judeo-Christian Genesis
creation narrative in which the Abrahamic God created the Universe. In
another type of story, the Universe is created from the union of male and
female deities, as in the Maori story of Rangi and Papa. In other stories,
the Universe is created by crafting it from pre-existing materials, such as
the corpse of a dead god — as from Tiamat in the Babylonian epic Enuma
Elish or from the giant Ymir in Norse mythology – or from chaotic
materials, as in Izanagi and Izanami in Japanese mythology. In other
stories, the Universe emanates from fundamental principles, such as Brahman
and Prakrti, the creation myth of the Serers,¹²⁵ or the yin and yang of the
Tao.

Philosophical models

Further information: Cosmology
See also: Pre-Socratic philosophy, Physics (Aristotle), Hindu cosmology,
Islamic cosmology and Philosophy of space and time

The pre-Socratic Greek philosophers and Indian philosophers developed some
of the earliest philosophical concepts of the Universe.¹⁴ ¹²⁶ The earliest
Greek philosophers noted that appearances can be deceiving, and sought to
understand the underlying reality behind the appearances. In particular,
they noted the ability of matter to change forms (e.g., ice to water to
steam) and several philosophers proposed that all the physical materials in
the world are different forms of a single primordial material, or arche.
The first to do so was Thales, who proposed this material to be water.
Thales' student, Anaximander, proposed that everything came from the
limitless apeiron. Anaximenes proposed the primordial material to be air on
account of its perceived attractive and repulsive qualities that cause the
arche to condense or dissociate into different forms. Anaxagoras proposed
the principle of Nous (Mind), while Heraclitus proposed fire (and spoke of
logos). Empedocles proposed the elements to be earth, water, air and fire.
His four-element model became very popular. Like Pythagoras, Plato believed
that all things were composed of number, with Empedocles' elements taking
the form of the Platonic solids. Democritus, and later philosophers—most
notably Leucippus—proposed that the Universe is composed of indivisible
atoms moving through void (vacuum), although Aristotle did not believe that
to be feasible because air, like water, offers resistance to motion. Air
will immediately rush in to fill a void, and moreover, without resistance,
it would do so indefinitely fast.¹⁴

Although Heraclitus argued for eternal change, his contemporary Parmenides
made the radical suggestion that all change is an illusion, that the true
underlying reality is eternally unchanging and of a single nature.
Parmenides denoted this reality as τὸ ἐν (The One). Parmenides' idea seemed
implausible to many Greeks, but his student Zeno of Elea challenged them
with several famous paradoxes. Aristotle responded to these paradoxes by
developing the notion of a potential countable infinity, as well as the
infinitely divisible continuum. Unlike the eternal and unchanging cycles of
time, he believed that the world is bounded by the celestial spheres and
that cumulative stellar magnitude is only finitely multiplicative.

The Indian philosopher Kanada, founder of the Vaisheshika school, developed
a notion of atomism and proposed that light and heat were varieties of the
same substance.¹²⁷ In the 5th century AD, the Buddhist atomist philosopher
Dignāga proposed atoms to be point-sized, durationless, and made of energy.
They denied the existence of substantial matter and proposed that movement
consisted of momentary flashes of a stream of energy.¹²⁸

The notion of temporal finitism was inspired by the doctrine of creation
shared by the three Abrahamic religions: Judaism, Christianity and Islam.
The Christian philosopher, John Philoponus, presented the philosophical
arguments against the ancient Greek notion of an infinite past and future.
Philoponus' arguments against an infinite past were used by the early
Muslim philosopher, Al-Kindi (Alkindus); the Jewish philosopher, Saadia
Gaon (Saadia ben Joseph); and the Muslim theologian, Al-Ghazali
(Algazel).¹²⁹

Astronomical concepts

Main articles: History of astronomy and Timeline of astronomy

Astronomical models of the Universe were proposed soon after astronomy
began with the Babylonian astronomers, who viewed the Universe as a flat
disk floating in the ocean, and this forms the premise for early Greek maps
like those of Anaximander and Hecataeus of Miletus.

Later Greek philosophers, observing the motions of the heavenly bodies,
were concerned with developing models of the Universe-based more profoundly
on empirical evidence. The first coherent model was proposed by Eudoxus of
Cnidos. According to Aristotle's physical interpretation of the model,
celestial spheres eternally rotate with uniform motion around a stationary
Earth. Normal matter is entirely contained within the terrestrial sphere.

De Mundo (composed before 250 BC or between 350 and 200 BC), stated, Five
elements, situated in spheres in five regions, the less being in each case
surrounded by the greater — namely, earth surrounded by water, water by
air, air by fire, and fire by ether — make up the whole Universe.¹³⁰

This model was also refined by Callippus and after concentric spheres were
abandoned, it was brought into nearly perfect agreement with astronomical
observations by Ptolemy. The success of such a model is largely due to the
mathematical fact that any function (such as the position of a planet) can
be decomposed into a set of circular functions (the Fourier modes). Other
Greek scientists, such as the Pythagorean philosopher Philolaus, postulated
(according to Stobaeus account) that at the center of the Universe was a
"central fire" around which the Earth, Sun, Moon and Planets revolved in
uniform circular motion.¹³¹

The Greek astronomer Aristarchus of Samos was the first known individual to
propose a heliocentric model of the Universe. Though the original text has
been lost, a reference in Archimedes' book The Sand Reckoner describes
Aristarchus's heliocentric model. Archimedes wrote: (translated into
English):

  "You, King Gelon, are aware the Universe is the name given by most
  astronomers to the sphere the center of which is the center of the Earth,
  while its radius is equal to the straight line between the center of the
  Sun and the center of the Earth. This is the common account as you have
  heard from astronomers. But Aristarchus has brought out a book consisting
  of certain hypotheses, wherein it appears, as a consequence of the
  assumptions made, that the Universe is many times greater than the
  Universe just mentioned. His hypotheses are that the fixed stars and the
  Sun remain unmoved, that the Earth revolves about the Sun on the
  circumference of a circle, the Sun lying in the middle of the orbit, and
  that the sphere of fixed stars, situated about the same center as the
  Sun, is so great that the circle in which he supposes the Earth to
  revolve bears such a proportion to the distance of the fixed stars as the
  center of the sphere bears to its surface"

Aristarchus thus believed the stars to be very far away, and saw this as
the reason why stellar parallax had not been observed, that is, the stars
had not been observed to move relative each other as the Earth moved around
the Sun. The stars are in fact much farther away than the distance that was
generally assumed in ancient times, which is why stellar parallax is only
detectable with precision instruments. The geocentric model, consistent
with planetary parallax, was assumed to be an explanation for the
unobservability of the parallel phenomenon, stellar parallax. The rejection
of the heliocentric view was apparently quite strong, as the following
passage from Plutarch suggests (On the Apparent Face in the Orb of the
Moon):

  "Cleanthes [a contemporary of Aristarchus and head of the Stoics ]
  thought it was the duty of the Greeks to indict Aristarchus of Samos on
  the charge of impiety for putting in motion the Hearth of the Universe
  [i.e. the Earth], . . . supposing the heaven to remain at rest and the
  Earth to revolve in an oblique circle, while it rotates, at the same
  time, about its own axis"

The only other astronomer from antiquity known by name who supported
Aristarchus's heliocentric model was Seleucus of Seleucia, a Hellenistic
astronomer who lived a century after Aristarchus.¹³² ¹³³ ¹³⁴ According to
Plutarch, Seleucus was the first to prove the heliocentric system through
reasoning, but it is not known what arguments he used. Seleucus' arguments
for a heliocentric cosmology were probably related to the phenomenon of
tides.¹³⁵ According to Strabo (1.1.9), Seleucus was the first to state that
the tides are due to the attraction of the Moon, and that the height of the
tides depends on the Moon's position relative to the Sun.¹³⁶ Alternatively,
he may have proved heliocentricity by determining the constants of a
geometric model for it, and by developing methods to compute planetary
positions using this model, like what Nicolaus Copernicus later did in the
16th century.¹³⁷ During the Middle Ages, heliocentric models were also
proposed by the Indian astronomer Aryabhata,¹³⁸ and by the Persian
astronomers Albumasar¹³⁹ and Al-Sijzi.¹⁴⁰

The Aristotelian model was accepted in the Western world for roughly two
millennia, until Copernicus revived Aristarchus's perspective that the
astronomical data could be explained more plausibly if the earth rotated on
its axis and if the sun were placed at the center of the Universe.

  In the center rests the Sun. For who would place this lamp of a very
  beautiful temple in another or better place than this wherefrom it can
  illuminate everything at the same time?
  — Nicolaus Copernicus, in Chapter 10, Book 1 of De Revolutionibus Orbium
  Coelestrum (1543)

As noted by Copernicus himself, the notion that the Earth rotates is very
old, dating at least to Philolaus (c. 450 BC), Heraclides Ponticus (c. 350
BC) and Ecphantus the Pythagorean. Roughly a century before Copernicus, the
Christian scholar Nicholas of Cusa also proposed that the Earth rotates on
its axis in his book, On Learned Ignorance (1440).¹⁴¹ Aryabhata (476–550
AD/CE)¹⁴² and Al-Sijzi¹⁴³ also proposed that the Earth rotates on its axis.
Empirical evidence for the Earth's rotation on its axis, using the
phenomenon of comets, was given by Tusi (1201–1274) and Ali Qushji
(1403–1474).¹⁴⁴

This cosmology was accepted by Isaac Newton, Christiaan Huygens and later
scientists.¹⁴⁵ Edmund Halley (1720)¹⁴⁶ and Jean-Philippe de Chéseaux
(1744)¹⁴⁷ noted independently that the assumption of an infinite space
filled uniformly with stars would lead to the prediction that the nighttime
sky would be as bright as the Sun itself; this became known as Olbers'
paradox in the 19th century.¹⁴⁸ Newton believed that an infinite space
uniformly filled with matter would cause infinite forces and instabilities
causing the matter to be crushed inwards under its own gravity.¹⁴⁵ This
instability was clarified in 1902 by the Jeans instability criterion.¹⁴⁹
One solution to these paradoxes is the Charlier Universe, in which the
matter is arranged hierarchically (systems of orbiting bodies that are
themselves orbiting in a larger system, ad infinitum) in a fractal way such
that the Universe has a negligibly small overall density; such a
cosmological model had also been proposed earlier in 1761 by Johann
Heinrich Lambert.⁵² ¹⁵⁰ A significant astronomical advance of the 18th
century was the realization by Thomas Wright, Immanuel Kant and others of
nebulae.¹⁴⁶

The modern era of physical cosmology began in 1917, when Albert Einstein
first applied his general theory of relativity to model the structure and
dynamics of the Universe.¹⁵¹

  is equal, on th eone hand, to the total charge located in the interior of

  that make up national or ethnic mythologies describe characters and
  events that common sense and experience tell us are impossible.
  Nevertheless, all cultures celebrate such myths and attribute to them
  various degrees of literal or symbolic truth.

[127] Will Durant, Our Oriental Heritage:
    "Two systems of Hindu thought propound physical theories suggestively
    similar to those of Greece. Kanada, founder of the Vaisheshika
    philosophy, held that the world is composed of atoms as many in kind as
    the various elements. The Jains more nearly approximated to Democritus
    by teaching that all atoms were of the same kind, producing different
    effects by diverse modes of combinations. Kanada believed light and
    heat to be varieties of the same substance; Udayana taught that all
    heat comes from the Sun; and Vachaspati, like Newton, interpreted light
    as composed of minute particles emitted by substances and striking the
    eye."
[128] Stcherbatsky, F. Th. (1930, 1962), Buddhist Logic, Volume 1, p. 19,
  Dover, New York:
    "The Buddhists denied the existence of substantial matter altogether.
    Movement consists for them of moments, it is a staccato movement,
    momentary flashes of a stream of energy... "Everything is
    evanescent",... says the Buddhist, because there is no stuff... Both
    systems [Sānkhya, and later Indian Buddhism] share in common a tendency
    to push the analysis of existence up to its minutest, last elements
    which are imagined as absolute qualities, or things possessing only one
    unique quality. They are called "qualities" (guna-dharma) in both
    systems in the sense of absolute qualities, a kind of atomic, or
    intra-atomic, energies of which the empirical things are composed. Both
    systems, therefore, agree in denying the objective reality of the
    categories of Substance and Quality,... and of the relation of
    Inference uniting them. There is in Sānkhya philosophy no separate
    existence of qualities. What we call quality is but a particular
    manifestation of a subtle entity. To every new unit of quality
    corresponds a subtle quantum of matter which is called guna, "quality",
    but represents a subtle substantive entity. The same applies to early
    Buddhism where all qualities are substantive... or, more precisely,
    dynamic entities, although they are also called dharmas ('qualities')."
